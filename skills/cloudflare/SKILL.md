# Cloudflare Platform Skill

Consolidated skill for building on the Cloudflare platform. Use decision trees below to find the right product, then load detailed references.

## Quick Decision Trees

### "I need to run code"

```
Need to run code?
├─ Serverless functions at the edge → workers/
├─ Full-stack web app with Git deploys → pages/
├─ Stateful coordination/real-time → durable-objects/
├─ Long-running multi-step jobs → workflows/
├─ Run containers → containers/
├─ Multi-tenant (customers deploy code) → workers-for-platforms/
├─ Scheduled tasks (cron) → cron-triggers/
├─ Lightweight edge logic (modify HTTP) → snippets/
├─ Process Worker execution events (logs/observability) → tail-workers/
└─ Optimize latency to backend infrastructure → smart-placement/
```

### "I need to store data"

```
Need storage?
├─ Key-value (config, sessions, cache) → kv/
├─ Relational SQL → d1/ (SQLite) or hyperdrive/ (existing Postgres/MySQL)
├─ Object/file storage (S3-compatible) → r2/
├─ Message queue (async processing) → queues/
├─ Vector embeddings (AI/semantic search) → vectorize/
├─ Strongly-consistent per-entity state → durable-objects/ (DO storage)
├─ Secrets management → secrets-store/
├─ Streaming ETL to R2 → pipelines/
└─ Persistent cache (long-term retention) → cache-reserve/
```

### "I need AI/ML"

```
Need AI?
├─ Run inference (LLMs, embeddings, images) → workers-ai/
├─ Vector database for RAG/search → vectorize/
├─ Build stateful AI agents → agents-sdk/
├─ Gateway for any AI provider (caching, routing) → ai-gateway/
└─ AI-powered search widget → ai-search/
```

### "I need networking/connectivity"

```
Need networking?
├─ Expose local service to internet → tunnel/
├─ TCP/UDP proxy (non-HTTP) → spectrum/
├─ WebRTC TURN server → turn/
├─ Private network connectivity → network-interconnect/
├─ Optimize routing → argo-smart-routing/
├─ Optimize latency to backend (not user) → smart-placement/
└─ Real-time video/audio → realtimekit/ or realtime-sfu/
```

### "I need security"

```
Need security?
├─ Web Application Firewall → waf/
├─ DDoS protection → ddos/
├─ Bot detection/management → bot-management/
├─ API protection → api-shield/
├─ CAPTCHA alternative → turnstile/
└─ Credential leak detection → waf/ (managed ruleset)
```

### "I need media/content"

```
Need media?
├─ Image optimization/transformation → images/
├─ Video streaming/encoding → stream/
├─ Browser automation/screenshots → browser-rendering/
└─ Third-party script management → zaraz/
```

### "I need infrastructure-as-code"

```
Need IaC? → pulumi/ (Pulumi), terraform/ (Terraform), or api/ (REST API)
```
