## Author self-review

I've reviewed my PR for the following:
- [ ] Metadata in the frontmatter, including `pcx_content_type` and - for tutorials - `updated: YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [ ] PCX content strategy overall.
- [ ] PCX style guidelines (product names, capitalization, etc.).
- [ ] Needed redirects (if deleting any existing pages).
- [ ] Code blocks && other formatting issues (bolding, italics, lists).
