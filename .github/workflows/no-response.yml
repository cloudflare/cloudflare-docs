# Both `issue_comment` and `scheduled` event types are required for this Action
# to work properly.

# This action helps us flag issues for more information.
# To trigger, add the `more-information-needed` label to an issue.
# The label will be removed if the author comments.
# If the author does not respond for a specific number of days, the issue will be automatically closed.
# However, if they do respond, the issue will be re-opened automatically and the label will be removed.
