## Notice

The root `index.js` file is the **generated output file**!

To make any changes to this GitHub Action, you must modify the `index.ts` file and rebuild the output file for effects to apply.

## Owners

To update the product ownership assignments, see the [`owners.ts`](/.github/actions/owners.ts) file. After making any edits, you **must rebuild this Action** to generate a new `index.js` for changes to take effect on the next commit.

## Development

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
#=> new "index.js" file
```
