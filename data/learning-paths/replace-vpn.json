Cloudflare provides discrete, Zero Trust enabled application and service access to all TCP and UDP ports in both on-premise and cloud networks. We do this using a combination of an endpoint agent and a network connector, but no other software or hardware is required for this deployment. Additionally, security policy is enforced at the Cloudflare edge and managed in your dashboard.",
