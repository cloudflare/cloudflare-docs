- term: cached bandwidth (cached egress bandwidth)
  general_definition: |-
    the amount of bandwidth served from Cloudflare without hitting the origin server. Cached bandwidth is the sum of all `EdgeResponseBytes` where `CacheCacheStatus` equals `hit`, `stale`, `updating`, `ignored`, or `revalidated`.

- term: cached requests
  general_definition: |-
    the number of requests served from Cloudflare without having to hit the origin server. Cached requests are the sum of all requests where `CacheCacheStatus` equals `hit`, `stale`, `updating`, `ignored`. This does not include `revalidated` since the request had to be sent to the origin server.

- term: dynamic content
  general_definition: |-
    dynamic content is content that changes based on factors specific to the user such as time of visit, location, and device. News websites or social media are examples of this type of content. For this type of website, content has to be fetched from the origin server every time it is requested.

- term: origin bandwidth (origin egress bandwidth)
  general_definition: |-
    the amount of data transferred from the origin server to Cloudflare within a certain period of time. Origin bandwidth is the sum of all `EdgeResponseBytes` where `OriginResponseStatus` does not equal `0`.

- term: saved bandwidth (saved egress bandwidth)
  general_definition: |-
    the percentage of bandwidth saved by caching on the Cloudflare network.

- term: static content
  general_definition: |-
    static content is website content that can be served directly from cache, without having to fetch it from the origin server. Static content includes files like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript that do not change frequently.

- term: uncached requests
  general_definition: |-
    uncached requests are requests that are not cached and therefore, are served from the origin server. Uncached requests are the sum of all requests where `CacheCacheStatus` does not equal to `hit`, `stale`, `updating`, or `ignored`.

- term: uncached bandwidth (uncached egress bandwidth)
  general_definition: |-
    uncached bandwidth is the amount of bandwidth that is not cached and therefore, is served from the origin. Uncached bandwidth is the sum of all `EdgeResponseBytes` where `CacheCacheStatus` does not equal `hit`, `stale`, `updating`, `ignored`, or `revalidated`.
