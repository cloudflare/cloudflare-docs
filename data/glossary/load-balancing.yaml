- term: origin pool
  general_definition: |-
    an origin pool is a group of origin servers, with each origin identified by its IP address or hostname.

    If you are familiar with DNS terminology, think of a pool as a “record set,” except Cloudflare only returns addresses that are considered healthy. You can attach health monitors to individual pools for customized monitoring.

- term: monitor
  general_definition: |-
    a monitor issues health monitor requests at regular intervals to evaluate the health of each server within an [origin pool](/load-balancing/pools/).

    When a pool [becomes unhealthy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/), your load balancer takes that pool out of the server rotation.

- term: health check
  general_definition: |-
    requests issued by a monitor at regular interval and — depending on the monitor settings — return a **pass** or **fail** value to make sure an origin is still able to receive traffic.

    Each health monitor request is trying to answer two questions:

    1. **Is the server offline?**: Does the server respond to the health monitor request at all? If so, does it respond quickly enough (as specified in the monitor's **Timeout** field)?
    2. **Is the server working as expected?**: Does the server respond with the expected HTTP response codes? Does it include specific information in the response body?

    If the answer to either of these questions is "No", then the server fails the health monitor request.
