Well the masquerade was over, where it was cursed by the moon in the reflection 
of jealousy masking the thirst for healing. Souls herded by osmosis raptures in the opaque 
precipitate of insights opening the doors to shackled insecurities.
Omne, so Hera desired the sacrifice of my faith ~ thus with love I pray she will be 
able to nullify the lifeless laborers from perishing in that construction that was 
architecture foundation which lashed whips on their souls. This regime suffocated their 
reform, refused regeneration.
I had begged for the shift in the light in the meadow as though the sun had been 
behind a cloud and then suddenly peeked out, illuminating that specific area. The clouds 
came down for me to voice its statue. At that moment a wind came up and it began to 
snow heavily, obscuring the awareness of the pilgrims.
The synchronistic process helped lives monitor themselves and extend description 
of air to those who Ever live in water. Hence, I offered my blood encased on a patch of 
satin to wrap the dagger of Innana and insulate fatigue.
Every cell of life tended to reproduce itself, but sustained their vibrancy and learn 
the prayer extensions, not reduce life to the ordinary. But often the process becomes 
antagonistic, where communication skills were ulterior and silent.
The myths and legends consoled the apostating complements only in hour glasses. 
Then the choking smoke perplexed one of them pushing what looked like a huge iron 
lung, only it was bigger and standing on tall, wide legs, apparently so that it could be 
rolled up over some one who was lying in a bed. The machinist was not a doctor, but only 
a technician, the perfusionist.
Thought must be mastered, dislodging a narrow opening to which was after all a 
cave. Struggle forward through melodious human cries that reverberated through the 
body, bringing forth an inner warmth and euphoria. I was told there was knowledge here 
that is needed, the prayer-fields helps us find our part to play in this evolution. Accept the 
mysteries of existence to focus entirely on spiritual evolution, on the life process itself, 
and now set the expectation into your prayer-field.
Pioneers deduce from history that each religious institution is like an inflexible 
roadblock on the path of progress. Each wars the other to complete the expression.
And round about the throne set in heaven I saw elders sitting, and I saw a new 
heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ~ 
reposting that the magical phoenix cried tears which had healing powers.
