    title: Billing reduction for WebSocket messages
    description: |-
      Durable Objects [request billing](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#billing-metrics) applies a 20:1 ratio for incoming WebSocket messages. For example, 1 million Websocket messages would be charged as 50,000 Durable Objects requests.

      This is a billing-only calculation and does not impact Durable Objects [metrics and analytics](/durable-objects/reference/graphql-analytics/).
