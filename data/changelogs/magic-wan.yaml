  title: WARP virtual IP addresses
  description: |-
    Customers using Gateway to filter traffic to Magic WAN destinations will now see traffic from Cloudflare egressing with WARP virtual IP addresses (CGNAT range), rather than public Cloudflare IP addresses. This simplifies configuration and improves visibility for customers.
