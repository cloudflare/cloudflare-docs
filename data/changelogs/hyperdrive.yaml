    title: Driver performance improvements
    description: |-
      Compatibility improvements to how Hyperdrive interoperates with the popular [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver have been released. These improvements allow queries made via Postgres.js to be correctly cached (when enabled) in Hyperdrive.

      Developers who had previously set `prepare: false` can remove this configuration when establishing a new Postgres.js client instance.

      Read the [documentation on supported drivers](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about database driver interoperability with Hyperdrive.
