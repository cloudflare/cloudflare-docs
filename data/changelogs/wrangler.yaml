    Previously `secret"bulk` would only log an error on failure of any of the upload requests.
    Now when 'secret:bulk' has an upload request fail it throws an Error which sends an `process.exit(1)` at the root `.catch()` signal.
    This will enable error handling in programmatic uses of `secret:bulk`.

        Commands:

        wrangler d1 time-travel info <database>     Retrieve information about a database at a specific point-in-time using Time Travel.
        Options:
              --timestamp  accepts a Unix (seconds from epoch) or RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2023-07-13T08:46:42.228Z) to retrieve a bookmark for  [string]
              --json       return output as clean JSON  [boolean] [default: false]

        wrangler d1 time-travel restore <database>  Restore a database back to a specific point-in-time.
        Options:
              --bookmark   Bookmark to use for time travel  [string]
              --timestamp  accepts a Unix (seconds from epoch) or RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2023-07-13T08:46:42.228Z) to retrieve a bookmark for  [string]

        `wrangler deploy` immediately deletes assets that are no longer current, which has a side-effect for existing progressive web app users of seeing 404 errors as the app tries to access assets that no longer exist.

        This new feature:

        -   does not change the default behavior of immediately deleting no-longer needed assets.
        -   allows users to opt-in to expiring newly obsoleted assets after the provided number of seconds hence, so that current users will have a time buffer before seeing 404 errors.
        -   is similar in concept to what was introduced in Wrangler 1.x with <https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/2221>.
        -   is careful to avoid extension of existing expiration targets on already expiring old assets, which may have contributed to unexpectedly large KV storage accumulations (perhaps why, in Wrangler 1.x, the reversion <https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/2228> happened).
        -   no breaking changes for users relying on the default behavior, but some output changes exist when the new option is used, to indicate the change in behavior.

        If a Worker is used as a service binding, a durable object namespace, an outbounds for a dynamic dispatch namespace, or a tail consumer, then deleting that Worker will break those existing ones that depend upon it. Deleting with ?force=true allows you to delete anyway, which is currently the default in Wrangler.
        Force deletes are not often necessary, however, and using it as the default has unfortunate consequences in the API. To avoid them, we check if any of those conditions exist, and present the information to the user. If they explicitly acknowledge they're ok with breaking their other Workers, fine, we let them do it. Otherwise, we'll always use the much safer non-force deletes. We also add a "--force" flag to the delete command to skip the checks and confirmation and proceed with ?force=true

        Ensure middleware is only registered on the first request when using module workers.
        This should prevent stack overflows and slowdowns when making large number of requests to `wrangler dev` with infrequent reloads.

Previously when wrangler dev would automatically reload on any file changes, it would fail to find any imported files.
    - You can now also connect directly to databases over TCP from a Worker, starting with [PostgreSQL](/workers/databases/connect-to-postgres/). Support for PostgreSQL is based on the popular `pg` driver, and allows you to connect to any PostgreSQL instance over TLS from a Worker directly.
    - The [R2 Migrator](/r2/data-migration/) (Super Slurper), which automates the process of migrating from existing object storage providers to R2, is now Generally Available.

        Fixes a regression in wrangler@3.x, where `wrangler pages dev --script-path=<my script path> -- <proxy command>` would start throwing esbuild errors.

        This PR teaches wrangler to return a non-success exit code when a set of migrations fails.
        It also cleans up `wrangler d1 migrations apply` output significantly, to only log information relevant to migrations.

        This PR adds a `d1 info <NAME>` command for getting information about a D1 database, including the current database size and state.

        This ensures consistency with other messaging, documentation and our dashboard,
        which all refer to deployments. This also avoids confusion with the similar but
        very different `npm publish` command. `wrangler publish` will remain a
        deprecated alias for now, but will be removed in the next major version of Wrangler.

        `wrangler dev` now runs fully-locally by default, using the open-source Cloudflare Workers runtime [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd).
        To restore the previous behaviour of running on a remote machine with access to production data, use the new `--remote` flag.
        The `--local` and `--experimental-local` flags have been deprecated, as this behaviour is now the default, and will be removed in the next major version.

        Wrangler will now persist local KV, R2, D1, Cache and Durable Object data
        in the `.wrangler` folder, by default, between reloads. This persistence
        directory can be customised with the `--persist-to` flag. The `--persist` flag
        has been removed, as this is now the default behaviour.

        Previously, if Wrangler was installed globally _and_ locally within a project,
        running the global Wrangler would instead invoke the local version.
        This behaviour was contrary to most other JavaScript CLI tools and has now been
        removed. We recommend you use `npx wrangler` instead, which will invoke the
        local version if installed, or install globally if not.

        Added support for a new type of safe bindings called "Constellation"
        that allows interacting with uploaded models in the context of these
        projects.

        Closes [#1920](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1920). Sometimes start the local dev server will kill
        the devRegistry server so that the devRegistry server can't be used. We can listen the devRegistry server close event
        and reset server to `null`. When registerWorker is called, we can check if the server is `null` and start a new server.

        With this PR, users will be able to run `wrangler d1 create <NAME> --experimental-backend` to create new D1 dbs that use an experimental backend. You can also run `wrangler d1 migrations apply <NAME> experimental-backend` to run migrations against an experimental database.
        On top of that, both `wrangler d1 migrations apply <NAME>` and `wrangler d1 execute <NAME>` now have a configurable `batch-size` flag, as the experimental backend can handle more than 10000 statements at a time.
