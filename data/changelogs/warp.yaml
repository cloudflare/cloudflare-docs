  title: WARP client for macOS (version 2024.5.287.1)
  description: |-
    A new beta release for the macOS WARP client is now available in the [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/cloudflare/apps/1.1.1.1-macos/distribution_groups/beta)

    Notable updates:
      - Fixed a known issue where the certificate was not always properly left behind in `/Library/Application Support/Cloudflare/installed_cert.pem`.
      - Fixed an issue so that that the reauth notification is cleared from the UI when the user switches configurations.
      - Fixed an issue by correcting the WARP client setting of macOS firewall rules. This relates to TunnelVision ([CVE-2024-3661](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3661)).
      - Fixed an issue that could cause the Cloudflare WARP menu bar application to disappear when switching configurations.

    Known issues:
      - If a user has an MDM file configured to support multiple profiles (for the switch configurations feature), and then changes to an MDM file configured for a single profile, the WARP client may not connect. The workaround is to use the `warp-cli registration delete` command to clear the registration, and then re-register the client.

  description: |-
    A new beta release for the Windows WARP client is now available in the [App Center](https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/cloudflare/apps/1.1.1.1-windows/distribution_groups/beta).

    Notable updates:
      - Added a new [Unable to Connect message](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/troubleshooting/client-errors/#cf_failed_read_system_dns_config) to the UI to help in troubleshooting.
      - In the upgrade window, a change was made to use international date formats to resolve an issue with localization.
      - Made a change to ensure DEX tests are not running when the tunnel is not up due to the device going to or waking from sleep. This is specific to devices using the S3 power model.
      - Fixed a known issue where the certificate was not always properly left behind in `%ProgramData%\Cloudflare\installed_cert.pem`.
      - Fixed an issue where ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages were being incorrectly sent on the WARP tunnel.
