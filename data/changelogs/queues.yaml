  title: Default content type now set to JSON
  description: |-
    The default [content type](/queues/reference/javascript-apis/#queuescontenttype) for messages published to a queue is now `json`, which improves compatibility with the upcoming pull-based queues.
    
    Any Workers created on or after the [compatibility date](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#queues_json_messages) of `2024-03-04`, or that explicitly set the `queues_json_messages` compatibility flag, will use the new default behaviour. Existing Workers with a compatibility date prior will continue to use `v8` as the default content type for published messages.

  title: Explicit retries no longer impact consumer concurrency/scaling.
  description: |-
    Calling `retry()` or `retryAll()` on a message or message batch will no longer have an impact on how Queues scales [consumer concurrency](/queues/reference/consumer-concurrency/).

    Previously, using [explicit retries](/queues/reference/batching-retries/#retries) via `retry()` or `retryAll()` would count as an error and could result in Queues scaling down the number of concurrent consumers.

  title: More queues per account - up to 10,000
  description: |-
    Developers building on Queues can now create up to 10,000 queues per account, enabling easier per-user, per-job and sharding use-cases.
  
    Refer to [Limits](/queues/platform/limits) to learn more about Queues' current limits.

  title: Higher consumer concurrency limits
  description: |-
    [Queue consumers](/queues/reference/consumer-concurrency/) can now scale to 20 concurrent invocations (per queue), up from 10. This allows you to scale out and process higher throughput queues more quickly.

    Queues with [no explicit limit specified](/queues/reference/consumer-concurrency/#limit-concurrency) will automatically scale to the new maximum.
  
    This limit will continue to grow during the Queues beta.

  title: Consumer concurrency (enabled)
  description: Queue consumers will now [automatically scale up](/queues/reference/consumer-concurrency/)
    based on the number of messages being written to the queue. To control or limit
    concurrency, you can explicitly define a [`max_concurrency`](/queues/reference/configuration/#consumer)
    for your consumer.

  title: Consumer concurrency (upcoming)
  description: |-
    Queue consumers will soon automatically scale up concurrently as a queues' backlog grows in order to keep overall message processing latency down. Concurrency will be enabled on all existing queues by 2023-03-28.

    **To opt-out, or to configure a fixed maximum concurrency**, set `max_concurrency = 1` in your `wrangler.toml` file or via [the queues dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/queues).

    **To opt-in, you do not need to take any action**: your consumer will begin to scale out as needed to keep up with your message backlog. It will scale back down as the backlog shrinks, and/or if a consumer starts to generate a higher rate of errors. To learn more about how consumers scale, refer to the [consumer concurrency](/queues/reference/consumer-concurrency/) documentation.

  title: Explicit acknowledgement (new feature)
  description: |-
    You can now [acknowledge individual messages with a batch](/queues/reference/batching-retries/#explicit-acknowledgement) by calling `.ack()` on a message.

    This allows you to mark a message as delivered as you process it within a batch, and avoids the entire batch from being redelivered if your consumer throws an error during batch processing. This can be particularly useful when you are calling external APIs, writing messages to a database, or otherwise performing non-idempotent actions on individual messages within a batch.

  title: Higher per-queue throughput
  description: The per-queue throughput limit has now been [raised to 400 messages
    per second](/queues/platform/limits/).
- publish_date: '2022-12-12'
  title: Increased per-account limits
  description: Queues now allows developers to create up to 100 queues per account,
    up from the initial beta limit of 10 per account. This limit will continue to
    increase over time.
- publish_date: '2022-12-13'
  title: sendBatch support
  description: The JavaScript API for Queue producers now includes a `sendBatch` method
    which supports sending up to 100 messages at a time.
