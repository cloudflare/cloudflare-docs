    title: HTTP API now returns a HTTP 429 error for overloaded D1 databases
    description: |-
      Previously, D1's [HTTP API](/api/operations/cloudflare-d1-query-database) returned a HTTP `500 Internal Server` error for queries that came in while a D1 database was overloaded. These requests now correctly return a `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` error.

      D1's [Workers API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) is unaffected by this change.

  - publish_date: "2024-04-30"
    title: D1 alpha databases will stop accepting live SQL queries on August 15, 2024
    description: |-
      Previously [deprecated alpha](/d1/platform/changelog/#2024-04-05) D1 databases need to be migrated by August 15, 2024 to accept new queries.

      Refer to [alpha database migration guide](/d1/platform/alpha-migration/) to migrate to the new, generally available, database architecture.

    title: HTTP API now returns a HTTP 400 error for invalid queries
    description: |-
      Previously, D1's [HTTP API](/api/operations/cloudflare-d1-query-database) returned a HTTP `500 Internal Server` error for an invalid query. An invalid SQL query now correctly returns a `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error.

      D1's [Workers API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) is unaffected by this change.

  - publish_date: "2024-04-05"
    title: D1 alpha databases are deprecated
    description: |-
      Now that D1 is generally available and production ready, alpha D1 databases are deprecated and should be migrated for better performance, reliability, and ongoing support.

      Refer to [alpha database migration guide](/d1/platform/alpha-migration/) to migrate to the new, generally available, database architecture.

  - publish_date: "2024-04-01"
    title: D1 is generally available
    description: |-
      D1 is now generally available and production ready. Read the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-d1-a-global-database/) for more details on new features in GA and to learn more about the upcoming D1 read replication API.

      * Developers with a Workers Paid plan now have a 10GB GB per-database limit (up from 2GB), which can be combined with existing limit of 50,000 databases per account.
      * Developers with a Workers Free plan retain the 500 MB per-database limit and can create up to 10 databases per account.
      * D1 databases can be [exported](/d1/build-with-d1/import-export-data/#export-an-existing-d1-database) as a SQL file.

    title: Change in `wrangler d1 execute` default
    description: |-
      As of `wrangler@3.33.0`, `wrangler d1 execute` and `wrangler d1 migrations apply` now default to using a local database, to match the default behavior of `wrangler dev`.

      It is also now possible to specify one of `--local` or `--remote` to explicitly tell wrangler which environment you wish to run your commands against.

  - publish_date: "2024-03-05"
    title: Billing for D1 usage
    description: |-
      As of 2024-03-05, D1 usage will start to be counted and may incur charges for an account's future billing cycle.

      Developers on the Workers Paid plan with D1 usage beyond [included limits](/d1/platform/pricing/#billing-metrics) will incur charges according to [D1's pricing](/d1/platform/pricing).

      Developers on the Workers Free plan can use up to the included limits. Usage beyond the limits below requires signing up for the $5/month Workers Paid plan.

      Account billable metrics are available in the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and [GraphQL API](/d1/observability/metrics-analytics/#metrics).

    title: API changes to `run()`
    description: |-
      A previous change (made on 2024-02-13) to the `run()` [query statement method](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/#await-stmtrun) has been reverted.

      `run()` now returns a `D1Result`, including the result rows, matching its original behaviour prior to the change on 2024-02-13.

      Future change to `run()` to return a [`D1ExecResult`](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/#return-object), as originally intended and documented, will be gated behind a [compatibility date](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) as to avoid breaking existing Workers relying on the way `run()` currently works.

  - publish_date: "2024-02-13"
    title: API changes to `raw()`, `all()` and `run()`
    description: |-
      D1's `raw()`, `all()` and `run()` [query statement methods](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/#query-statement-methods) have been updated to reflect their intended behaviour and improve compatibility with ORM libraries.

      `raw()` now correctly returns results as an array of arrays, allowing the correct handling of duplicate column names (such as when joining tables), as compared to `all()`, which is unchanged and returns an array of objects. To include an array of column names in the results when using `raw()`, use `raw({columnNames: true})`.

      `run()` no longer incorrectly returns a `D1Result` and instead returns a [`D1ExecResult`](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/#return-object) as originally intended and documented.

      This may be a breaking change for some applications that expected `raw()` to return an array of objects.

      Refer to [D1 client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) to review D1's query methods, return types and TypeScript support in detail.

  - publish_date: "2024-01-18"
    title: Support for LIMIT on UPDATE and DELETE statements
    description: |-
      D1 now supports adding a `LIMIT` clause to `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements, which allows you to limit the impact of a potentially dangerous operation.

  - publish_date: "2023-12-18"
    title: Legacy alpha automated backups disabled
    description: |-
      Databases using D1's legacy alpha backend will no longer run automated [hourly backups](/d1/reference/backups/). You may still choose to take manual backups of these databases.

      The D1 team recommends moving to D1's new [production backend](/d1/platform/changelog/#the-d1-public-beta-is-here), which will require you to export and import your existing data. D1's production backend is faster than the original alpha backend. The new backend also supports [Time Travel](/d1/reference/time-travel/), which allows you to restore your database to any minute in the past 30 days without relying on hourly or manual snapshots.

  - publish_date: "2023-10-03"
    title: Create up to 50,000 D1 databases
    description: |-
      Developers using D1 on a Workers Paid plan can now create up to 50,000 databases as part of ongoing increases to D1's limits.

      * This further enables database-per-user use-cases and allows you to isolate data between customers.
      * Total storage per account is now 50 GB.
      * D1's [analytics and metrics](/d1/observability/metrics-analytics/) provide per-database usage data.

      If you need to create more than 50,000 databases or need more per-account storage, [reach out](/d1/platform/limits/) to the D1 team to discuss.

  - publish_date: "2023-09-28"
    title: The D1 public beta is here
    description: |-
      D1 is now in public beta, and storage limits have been increased:

      * Developers with a Workers Paid plan now have a 2 GB per-database limit (up from 500 MB) and can create 25 databases per account (up from 10). These limits will continue to increase automatically during the public beta.
      * Developers with a Workers Free plan retain the 500 MB per-database limit and can create up to 10 databases per account.

      Databases must be using D1's [new storage subsystem](/d1/platform/changelog/#new-default-storage-subsystem) to benefit from the increased database limits.

      Read the [announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/d1-open-beta-is-here/) for more details about what is new in the beta and what is coming in the future for D1.

  - publish_date: "2023-08-19"
    title: Row count now returned per query
    description: |-
      D1 now returns a count of `rows_written` and `rows_read` for every query executed, allowing you to assess the cost of query for both [pricing](/d1/platform/pricing/) and [index optimization](/d1/build-with-d1/use-indexes/) purposes.

      The `meta` object returned in [D1's Client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) contains a total count of the rows read (`rows_read`) and rows written (`rows_written`) by that query. For example, a query that performs a full table scan (for example, `SELECT * FROM users`) from a table with 5000 rows would return a `rows_read` value of `5000`:
      ```json
      "meta": {
        "duration": 0.20472300052642825,
        "size_after": 45137920,
        "rows_read": 5000,
        "rows_written": 0
      }
      ```

      Refer to [D1 pricing documentation](/d1/platform/pricing/) to understand how reads and writes are measured. D1 remains free to use during the alpha period.

    title: Bind D1 from the Cloudflare dashboard
    description: |-
      You can now [bind a D1 database](/d1/get-started/#4-bind-your-worker-to-your-d1-database) to your Workers directly in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com). To bind D1 from the Cloudflare dashboard, select your Worker project -> **Settings** -> **Variables** -> and select **D1 Database Bindings**.

      Note: If you have previously deployed a Worker with a D1 database binding with a version of `wrangler` prior to `3.5.0`, you must upgrade to [`wrangler v3.5.0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/releases/tag/wrangler%403.5.0) first before you can edit your D1 database bindings in the Cloudflare dashboard. New Workers projects do not have this limitation.

      Legacy D1 alpha users who had previously prefixed their database binding manually with `__D1_BETA__` should remove this as part of this upgrade. Your Worker scripts should call your D1 database via `env.BINDING_NAME` only. Refer to the latest [D1 getting started guide](/d1/get-started/#4-bind-your-worker-to-your-d1-database) for best practices.

      We recommend all D1 alpha users begin using wrangler `3.5.0` (or later) to benefit from improved TypeScript types and future D1 API improvements.
  - publish_date: "2023-08-01"
    title: Per-database limit now 500 MB
    description: |-
      Databases using D1's [new storage subsystem](/d1/platform/changelog/#new-default-storage-subsystem) can now grow to 500 MB each, up from the previous 100 MB limit. This applies to both existing and newly created databases.

      Refer to [Limits](/d1/platform/limits/) to learn about D1's limits.
  - publish_date: "2023-07-27"
    title: New default storage subsystem
    description: |-
      Databases created via the Cloudflare dashboard and Wrangler (as of `v3.4.0`) now use D1's new storage subsystem by default. The new backend can [be 6 - 20x faster](https://blog.cloudflare.com/d1-turning-it-up-to-11/) than D1's original alpha backend.

      To understand which storage subsystem your database uses, run `wrangler d1 info YOUR_DATABASE` and inspect the version field in the output.

      Databases with `version: beta` use the new storage backend and support the [Time Travel](/d1/reference/time-travel/) API. Databases with `version: alpha` only use D1's older, legacy backend.
  - publish_date: "2023-07-27"
    title: Time Travel
    description: |-
      [Time Travel](/d1/reference/time-travel/) is now available. Time Travel allows you to restore a D1 database back to any minute within the last 30 days (Workers Paid plan) or 7 days (Workers Free plan), at no additional cost for storage or restore operations.

      Refer to the [Time Travel](/d1/reference/time-travel/) documentation to learn how to travel backwards in time.

      Databases using D1's [new storage subsystem](https://blog.cloudflare.com/d1-turning-it-up-to-11/) can use Time Travel. Time Travel replaces the [snapshot-based backups](/d1/reference/backups/) used for legacy alpha databases.
  - publish_date: "2023-06-28"
    title: Metrics and analytics
    description: |-
      You can now view [per-database metrics](/d1/observability/metrics-analytics/) via both the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/).

      D1 currently exposes read & writes per second, query response size, and query latency percentiles.
  - publish_date: "2023-06-16"
    title: Generated columns documentation
    description:
      New documentation has been published on how to use D1's support for
      [generated columns](/d1/reference/generated-columns/) to define columns that are
      dynamically generated on write (or read). Generated columns allow you to extract
      data from [JSON objects](/d1/build-with-d1/query-json/) or use the output of other
      SQL functions.
  - publish_date: "2023-06-12"
    title: Deprecating Error.cause
    description: |-
      As of [`wrangler v3.1.1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/releases/tag/wrangler%403.1.1) the [D1 client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) now returns [detailed error messages](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/#errors) within the top-level `Error.message` property, and no longer requires developers to inspect the `Error.cause.message` property.

      To facilitate a transition from the previous `Error.cause` behaviour, detailed error messages will continue to be populated within `Error.cause` as well as the top-level `Error` object until approximately July 14th, 2023. Future versions of both `wrangler` and the D1 client API will no longer populate `Error.cause` after this date.
  - publish_date: "2023-05-19"
    title: New experimental backend
    description: |-
      D1 has a new experimental storage back end that dramatically improves query throughput, latency and reliability. The experimental back end will become the default back end in the near future. To create a database using the experimental backend, use `wrangler` and set the `--experimental-backend` flag when creating a database:
      ```sh
      $ wrangler d1 create your-database --experimental-backend
      ```

      Read more about the experimental back end in the [announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/d1-turning-it-up-to-11/).
  - publish_date: "2023-05-19"
    title: Location hints
    description:
      You can now provide a [location hint](/d1/configuration/data-location/)
      when creating a D1 database, which will influence where the leader (writer) is
      located. By default, D1 will automatically create your database in a location
      close to where you issued the request to create a database. In most cases this
      allows D1 to choose the optimal location for your database on your behalf.
  - publish_date: "2023-05-17"
    title: Query JSON
    description:
      "[New documentation](/d1/build-with-d1/query-json/) has been published
      that covers D1's extensive JSON function support. JSON functions allow you to
      parse, query and modify JSON directly from your SQL queries, reducing the number
      of round trips to your database, or data queried."
