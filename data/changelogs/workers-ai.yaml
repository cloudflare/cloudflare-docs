  title: Add AI native binding
  description: |-
    * Added new AI native binding, you can now run models with `const resp = await env.AI.run(modelName, inputs)`
    * Deprecated `@cloudflare/ai` npm package. While existing solutions using the @cloudflare/ai package will continue to work, no new Workers AI features will be supported.
      Moving to native AI bindings is highly recommended
