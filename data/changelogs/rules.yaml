  title: Origin Rules now allow port numbers in Host Header Override
  description: |-
    Customers can now use arbitrary port numbers in Host Header Override in Origin Rules. Previously, only hostname was allowed as a value (for example, `example.com`). Now, you can set the value to `hostname:port` (for example, `example.com:1234`) as well.
