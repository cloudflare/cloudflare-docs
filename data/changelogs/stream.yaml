- publish_date: '2023-10-10'
  title: SRT Audio Improvements
  description: |-

- publish_date: '2023-09-25'
  title: LL-HLS Beta
  description: |-
    Low-Latency HTTP Live Streaming (LL-HLS) is now in open beta. Enable LL-HLS on your [live input](/stream/stream-live/start-stream-live/) for automatic low-latency playback using the Stream built-in player where supported.

- publish_date: '2023-03-21'
  title: Limits for downloadable MP4s for live recordings
  description: |-
    Previously, generating a download for a live recording exceeding four hours resulted in failure.

    To fix the issue, now video downloads are only available for live recordings under four hours. Live recordings exceeding four hours can still be played but cannot be downloaded.
- publish_date: '2023-01-04'
  title: Earlier detection (and rejection) of non-video uploads
  description: |-
    Cloudflare Stream now detects non-video content on upload using [the POST API](/stream/uploading-videos/upload-video-file/) and returns a 400 Bad Request HTTP error with code `10059`.

    Previously, if you or one of your users attempted to upload a file that is not a video (ex: an image), the request to upload would appear successful, but then fail to be encoded later on.

    With this change, Stream responds to the upload request with an error, allowing you to give users immediate feedback if they attempt to upload non-video content.
- publish_date: '2022-12-08'

    For more, refer to [the docs](/stream/webrtc-beta/).
- publish_date: '2022-11-07'
  title: Deprecating the 'per-video' Analytics API
  description: |-
    The “per-video” analytics API is being deprecated. If you still use this API, you will need to switch to using the [GraphQL Analytics API](/stream/getting-analytics/fetching-bulk-analytics/) by February 1, 2023. After this date, the per-video analytics API will be no longer available.

    The GraphQL Analytics API provides the same functionality and more, with additional filters and metrics, as well as the ability to fetch data about multiple videos in a single request. Queries are faster, more reliable, and built on a shared analytics system that you can [use across many Cloudflare products](/analytics/graphql-api/features/data-sets/).

    For more about this change and how to migrate existing API queries, refer to [this post](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/migrate-to-the-stream-graphql-analytics-api-by-feb-1st-2023/433252) and the [GraphQL Analytics API docs](/stream/getting-analytics/fetching-bulk-analytics/).
- publish_date: '2022-11-01'
  title: Create an unlimited number of live inputs
  description: |-
    Cloudflare Stream now has no limit on the number of [live inputs](/api/operations/stream-live-inputs-retrieve-a-live-input) you can create. Stream is designed to allow your end-users to go live — live inputs can be created quickly on-demand via a single API request for each of user of your platform or app.

    For more on creating and managing live inputs, get started with the [docs](/stream/stream-live/).
- publish_date: '2022-10-20'
  title: More accurate bandwidth estimates for live video playback
  description: |-
    When playing live video, Cloudflare Stream now provides significantly more accurate estimates of the bandwidth needs of each quality level to client video players. This ensures that live video plays at the highest quality that viewers have adequate bandwidth to play.

    As live video is streamed to Cloudflare, we transcode it to make it available to viewers at multiple quality levels. During transcoding, we learn about the real bandwidth needs of each segment of video at each quality level, and use this to provide an estimate of the bandwidth requirements of each quality level the in HLS (`.m3u8`) and DASH (`.mpd`) manifests.

    If a live stream contains content with low visual complexity, like a slideshow presentation, the bandwidth estimates provided in the HLS manifest will be lower, ensuring that the most viewers possible view the highest quality level, since it requires relatively little bandwidth. Conversely, if a live stream contains content with high visual complexity, like live sports with motion and camera panning, the bandwidth estimates provided in the HLS manifest will be higher, ensuring that viewers with inadequate bandwidth switch down to a lower quality level, and their playback does not buffer.

    This change is particularly helpful if you're building a platform or application that allows your end users to create their own live streams, where these end users have their own streaming software and hardware that you can't control. Because this new functionality adapts based on the live video we receive, rather than just the configuration advertised by the broadcaster, even in cases where your end users' settings are less than ideal, client video players will not receive excessively high estimates of bandwidth requirements, causing playback quality to decrease unnecessarily. Your end users don't have to be OBS Studio experts in order to get high quality video playback.

    No work is required on your end — this change applies to all live inputs, for all customers of Cloudflare Stream. For more, refer to the [docs](/stream/stream-live/#bitrate-estimates-at-each-quality-level-bitrate-ladder).
- publish_date: '2022-10-05'

- publish_date: '2022-08-15'
  title: Unique subdomain for your Stream Account
  description: |-
    URLs in the Stream Dashboard and Stream API now use a subdomain specific to your Cloudflare Account: `customer-{CODE}.cloudflarestream.com`. This change allows you to:

    1. Use [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) directives specific to your Stream subdomain, to ensure that only videos from your Cloudflare account can be played on your website.

    2. Allowlist only your Stream account subdomain at the network-level to ensure that only videos from a specific Cloudflare account can be accessed on your network.

    No action is required from you, unless you use Content Security Policy (CSP) on your website. For more on CSP, read the [docs](/stream/faq/#i-use-content-security-policy-csp-on-my-website-what-domains-do-i-need-to-add-to-which-directives).
