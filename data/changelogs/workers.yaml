    - An implementation of the [`node:crypto`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/crypto/)
      API from Node.js is now available when the [`nodejs_compat` compatibility flag](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/)
      is enabled.

    - An implementation of the [`util.MIMEType`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#class-utilmimetype)
      API from Node.js is now available when the [`nodejs_compat` compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/)
      is enabled.

    - An implementation of the [`process.env`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/process) API from Node.js is now available when using the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag.
    - An implementation of the [`diagnostics_channel`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/diagnostics-channel) API from Node.js is now available when using the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag.

    - Added the [`strict_crypto_checks`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#strict-crypto-error-checking) compatibility flag to enable additional [Web Crypto API](/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/) error and security checking.
    - Fixes regression in the [TCP Sockets API](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) where `connect("google.com:443")` would fail with a `TypeError`.
- publish_date: '2023-06-19'
  description: |-
    - The [TCP Sockets API](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) now reports clearer errors when a connection cannot be established.
    - Updated V8 to 11.5.
- publish_date: '2023-06-09'
  description: |-
    - `AbortSignal.any()` is now available.
    - Updated V8 to 11.4.
    - Following an update to the [WHATWG URL spec](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-urlsearchparams), the `delete()` and `has()` methods of the `URLSearchParams` class now accept an optional second argument to specify the search parameter’s value. This is potentially a breaking change, so it is gated behind the new `urlsearchparams_delete_has_value_arg` and [`url_standard`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#new-url-parser-implementation) compatibility flags.
    - Added the [`strict_compression_checks`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#strict-compression-error-checking) compatibility flag for additional [`DecompressionStream`](/workers/runtime-apis/web-standards/#compression-streams) error checking.

    - A new [Hibernatable WebSockets API](/durable-objects/api/hibernatable-websockets-api/)
    (beta) has been added to [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/). The Hibernatable
    WebSockets API allows a Durable Object that is not currently running an event
    handler (for example, processing a WebSocket message or alarm) to be removed from
    memory while keeping its WebSockets connected (“hibernation”). A Durable Object
    that hibernates will not incur billable Duration (GB-sec) charges.

    - The [new `connect()` method](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) allows you to connect to any TCP-speaking services directly from your Workers. To learn more about other protocols supported on the Workers platform, visit the [new Protocols documentation](/workers/learning/protocols/).
    - We have added new [native database integrations](/workers/databases/native-integrations/) for popular serverless database providers, including Neon, PlanetScale, and Supabase. Native integrations automatically handle the process of creating a connection string and adding it as a Secret to your Worker.
    - You can now also connect directly to databases over TCP from a Worker, starting with [PostgreSQL](/workers/databases/connect-to-postgres/). Support for PostgreSQL is based on the popular `pg` driver, and allows you to connect to any PostgreSQL instance over TLS from a Worker directly.
    - The [R2 Migrator](/r2/data-migration/) (Super Slurper), which automates the process of migrating from existing object storage providers to R2, is now Generally Available.

    - [Cursor](/workers/ai/), an experimental AI assistant, trained to answer
    questions about Cloudflare's Developer Platform, is now available to preview!
    Cursor can answer questions about Workers and the Cloudflare Developer Platform,
    and is itself built on Workers. You can read more about Cursor in the [announcement
    blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cursor-the-ai-assistant-for-docs/).

    - The [`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)
    and [`performance.timeOrigin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timeOrigin)
    APIs can now be used in Cloudflare Workers. Just like `Date.now()`, for [security
    reasons](/workers/learning/security-model/) time only advances after I/O.

    - The new `nodeJsCompatModule` type can be used with a Worker bundle to emulate a Node.js environment. Common Node.js globals such as `process` and `Buffer` will be present, and `require('...')` can be used to load Node.js built-ins without the `node:` specifier prefix.
    - Fixed an issue where websocket connections would be disconnected when updating workers. Now, only websockets connected to Durable Object instances are disconnected by updates to that Durable Object’s code.

    - The Web Crypto API now supports curves Ed25519 and X25519 defined in the Secure Curves specification.
    - The global `connect` method has been moved to a `cloudflare:sockets` module.

    - `URL.canParse(...)` is a new standard API for testing that an input string can be parsed successfully as a URL without the additional cost of creating and throwing an error.
    - The Workers-specific `IdentityTransformStream` and `FixedLengthStream` classes now support specifying a `highWaterMark` for the writable-side that is used for backpressure signaling using the standard `writer.desiredSize`/`writer.ready` mechanisms.

    - Fixed a bug in Wrangler tail and and live logs on the dashboard that
    prevented the Administrator Read-Only and Workers Tail Read roles from successfully
    tailing Workers.

    - [Workers Logpush](/workers/observability/logpush/#limits) now supports
    300 characters per log line. This is an increase from the previous limit of 150
    characters per line.

    - Fixed a bug where transferring large request bodies to a Durable Object was unexpectedly slow.
    - Previously, an error would be thrown when trying to access unimplemented standard `Request` and `Response` properties. Now those will be left as `undefined`.

    - Durable Objects can now use jurisdictions with `idFromName` via a new subnamespace API.
    - V8 updated to 10.9.
