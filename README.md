## Why Cloudflare Docs is open source

Our documentation is open source so that we can stay connected with our community and quickly implement feedback. Whether you have opened an issue to provide feedback or contributed your own content, we thank you for helping us maintain quality documentation.

If you have any feedback for our documentation or are interested in contributing, please refer to our [contribution guidelines.](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/production/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Setup

You must have a recent version of Node.js (22+) installed. You may use [Volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta), a Node version manager, to install the latest version of Node and `npm`, which is a package manager that is included with `node`'s installation.

```sh
$ curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
$ volta install node@22
```

Install the Node.js dependencies for this project using npm or another package manager:

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Development

When making changes to the site, including any content changes, you may run a local development server by running the following command:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

This spawns a server that will be accessible via `http://localhost:1111` in your browser. Additionally, any changes made within the project – including `content/**` changes – will automatically reload your browser tab(s), allowing you to instantly preview your changes.

### Recommendations

Part of our application accesses the GitHub API (to populate the [Wrangler changelog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/changelog/wrangler/)).

<!--
Since GitHub gives a higher request limit to authenticated requests, you may want to add a [classic token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#personal-access-tokens-classic) with permissions for `repos:public_repo` to `/assets/secrets/github_token.txt`. The token value should be the only thing in your file.

## Deployment

Our docs are deployed using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Every commit pushed to production will automatically deploy to [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com), and any pull requests opened will have a corresponding staging URL available in the pull request comments.
