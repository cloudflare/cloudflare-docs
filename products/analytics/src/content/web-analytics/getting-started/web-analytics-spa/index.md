# Web Analytics for Single Page Applications (SPAs)


Cloudflare Web Analytics enables measuring SPAs automatically by overriding the History API's `pushState` function and listening to the `onpopstate`. Hash-based router is not supported.

To disable measuring SPAs, add the "spa" option with a false value in the data attribute as shown below.

```html
<script 
  defer src='https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js' 
  data-cf-beacon=' {"token": "42e216b9090ru59384ygu891dce9eecde", "spa": false} '
  ></script>
```

If you are using Google Tag Manager (GTM), use the query string to pass the spa option instead.

```html
<script 
  defer src='https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js?token=42e216b9090ru59384ygu891dce9eecde&spa=false'
  ></script>
```
