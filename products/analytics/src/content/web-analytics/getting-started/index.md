# Enabling Cloudflare Web Analytics


If you already have a Cloudflare account, go to Web Analytics from your Account Home page and skip to step 4.

1. Visit [Get started with Web Analytics](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/web-analytics). 
1. Enter your Email address and password.
1. Click **Create Account**.
1. Enter your website’s hostname and click **Next**.
1. Copy the JS Snippet and add it to any of your website’s HTML pages before the ending body tag.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Wait for the redirect to the Web Analytics page or click **View Analytics**. It may take a few minutes for Web Analytics data to appear.

Repeat steps 4-7 for all of the websites you want to track with Web Analytics. Cloudflare enforces a soft limit of 10 sites per account, but that can be adjusted by contacting Cloudflare support. 

Once enabled, find and copy the JS Snippet on the left menu of the Web Analytics page anytime.
