## Sites not proxied through Cloudflare

1. Go to [Get started with Web Analytics](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/web-analytics).
1. Enter an Email address and password.
1. Click **Create Account**.
1. Enter your website’s hostname.
1. Copy the JS snippet.
1. Add the JS snippet to any of your website’s HTML pages before the ending body tag.
1. Click **Done**.

Repeat steps 4-8 for all of the websites you want to track with Web Analytics by going to **Quick Actions** > **Add a site** from the Web Analytics Sites page. Adjust Web Analytics for your site at any time by clicking **Manage site**.

For more information on how many sites you can track, refer to [Limits](../understanding-web-analytics/limits/).
