# Understanding Cloudflare Web Analytics

View your websiteâ€™s page views, visits, [page load time](/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/page-load-time-summary/), and [Core Web Vitals](/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/core-web-vitals/) by switching between views on the graph. You can also filter data by various [dimensions](/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/dimensions/).

## High-Level Metrics

* Visits - A page view that originated from a different website or direct link. Cloudflare checks where the HTTP referer does not match the hostname. One visit can consist of multiple page views.
* Page views - A successful HTTP response with a content-type of HTML.
* Page load time - The total amount of time required to load the page.
* Core Web Vitals - Higher-level metrics designed by Google to capture the user experience more completely.
