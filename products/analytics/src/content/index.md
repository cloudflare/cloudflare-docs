## Cloudflare Web Analytics

[Cloudflare Web Analytics](/web-analytics) provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website without changing your DNS or using Cloudflareâ€™s proxy.

## GraphQL Analytics API

With the [GraphQL Analytics API](/graphql-api), all of your performance, security, and reliability data is available from one endpoint.
And you can select exactly what you need, from one metric for a domain to multiple metrics aggregated for your account.
