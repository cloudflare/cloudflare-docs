# HTTP DDoS Attack Protection Managed Ruleset

The Cloudflare HTTP DDoS Attack Protection Managed Ruleset is a set of pre-configured rules used to match known DDoS attack vectors at layer 7 (application layer) on the edge, like the following:

* Requests causing large amounts of origin errors
* Excessive traffic hitting origin
* Excessive traffic hitting cache
* Abuse of search features and authentication endpoints
* Other attack vectors

Cloudflare updates the list of rules in the Managed Ruleset on a regular basis.

The HTTP DDoS Attack Protection Managed Ruleset provides users with increased observability into L7 DDoS attacks mitigated by Cloudflare, informing users of ongoing or past attacks. The Firewall dashboard, available at **Firewall** > **Overview**, will display additional information on the types of L7 DDoS attacks detected for a specific zone.

You can adjust the behavior of the rules in the Managed Ruleset by modifying the following parameters:
