# Managed Rulesets

The DDoS Attack Protection Managed Rulesets provide comprehensive protection against a variety of DDoS attacks across L3/4 (network layer) and L7 (application layer) of the [OSI model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/), including the following:

* Attacks that are generated by known attack tools and botnets
* Traffic anomalies and abnormalities
* Protocol violations
* Reflection and amplification attacks
* Stateless and stateful attacks
* Traffic that causes an increase in origin errors

The available DDoS Attack Protection Managed Rulesets are:

<Definitions>

- **[HTTP DDoS Attack Protection](/managed-rulesets/http)**

    - This ruleset includes rules to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks over HTTP and HTTPS. Cloudflare WAF/CDN customers on all plans are protected by this ruleset and can customize it.

- **[Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection](/managed-rulesets/network)**

    - This ruleset includes rules to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks on L3/4 of the OSI model such as UDP floods, SYN-ACK reflection attacks, SYN Floods, and DNS floods.
