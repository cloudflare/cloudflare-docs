# About Cloudflare DDoS Protection

Cloudflare provides unmetered and unlimited [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) protection to all customers on all plans and services.

The protection is enabled by Cloudflareâ€™s [Autonomous DDoS Protection Edge](/about/components#autonomous-edge), which automatically detects and mitigates DDoS attacks.

The Autonomous Edge includes multiple dynamic mitigation rules exposed as [Cloudflare DDoS Attack Protection Managed Rulesets](/managed-rulesets). These rulesets provide comprehensive protection against a variety of DDoS attacks across L3/4 and L7 of the OSI model, and are enabled by default. You can customize the mitigation rules in these rulesets to optimize and tailor the protection to your needs.
