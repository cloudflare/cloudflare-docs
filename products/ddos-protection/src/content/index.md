# Cloudflare DDoS Protection

Cloudflare automatically detects and mitigates [Distributed Denial of Service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) (DDoS) attacks using its [Autonomous Edge](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-dive-cloudflare-autonomous-edge-ddos-protection/).

The Autonomous Edge includes multiple dynamic mitigation rules that are exposed as the [Cloudflare DDoS Protection Managed Rulesets](/managed-rulesets) and are enabled by default. You can customize the mitigation rules included in these rulesets to optimize and tailor the protection to your needs.
