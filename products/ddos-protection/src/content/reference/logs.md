# DDoS logs

Retrieve HTTP events using [Cloudflare Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/) to integrate them into your SIEM systems.

Additionally, if you are a Magic Transit or a Spectrum customer on an Enterprise plan, you can also export L3/4 traffic and DDoS attack logs using the GraphQL API and feed this information into your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. For more information, refer to the [Export GraphQL data to CSV tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/tutorials/export-graphql-to-csv).
