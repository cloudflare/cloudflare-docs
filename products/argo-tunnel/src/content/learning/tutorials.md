You can find many tutorials in [Cloudflare One documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials)
that use Argo Tunnels.

The following list highlights the most relevant ones for running Argo Tunnels:
 * [Share a local development environment with a colleague](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/share-new-site): a good entry-level tutorial for creating, routing and running a Named Argo Tunnel.
 * [Best practice to run Argo Tunnels without cert.pem](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/credentials-only): recommended for administrators so that they create and route the Named Tunnels, and then allow their users to run those Tunnels without the `cert.pem` file.
 * [Serve multiple origins with a single Argo Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/multi-origin): explains in detail how to manage better your Argo Tunnels by having a single one with many origins being served.
 * [Run your Gitlab instance via Argo Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/gitlab): the Argo Tunnel is used to serve both HTTP and SSH traffic to a Gitlab instance.
