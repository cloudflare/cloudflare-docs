# Run as a Kubernetes sidecar

<Aside>

Running Argo Tunnel in a sidecar model is meant as an
alternative to the Argo Tunnel Ingress Controller. The two should not be used
simultaneously.

</Aside>

## Sidecar model background

A Kubernetes [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) consists of
one or more containers that share storage and network. Pods are defined by a
configuration file that determines the deployment of the containers, typically
in a YAML file.

Containers within a pod share an IP address space and can address each other over
localhost. Argo Tunnel can be run as a sidecar in a pod - a separate container
that performs its own function distinct from the application container.

In this model, the Argo Tunnel daemon, `cloudflared`, runs in its own container
and connects to the Cloudflare network to proxy requests for an associated
hostname. The `cloudflared` container will then send those requests to port
8080 on the application container over the common localhost in the Pod using the
shared IP address space.

## Docker image

Cloudflare publishes an official Docker image of `cloudflared` available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared).

Alternatively, you can build your own image. `cloudflared` is written in Go and can be built
in a Docker container by generating a Dockerfile that defines the Go
version, the working directory, and the steps to run and install the application.

Once built, the image will need to be pushed to a container registry that the
Kubernetes cluster can reach (whether a private registry or a public one like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry).

## Secret generation

Even though Kubernetes will grab the `cloudflared` image from a container
registry, the sidecar model still needs a mechanism for authentication.
Argo Tunnel authenticates machines to a hostname using a certificate
downloaded on the origin when the user logs in to their Cloudflare
account.

Before deploying to a cluster, that certificate must be converted into a
**Kubernetes secret**. A Kubernetes secret is an object that Kubernetes can securely use to configure the pod while reducing the risk of exposure of sensitive data.

To generate a Kubernetes secret:

1. Download `cloudflared` in a development environment and follow the steps to authenticate the tool with the corresponding Cloudflare account.

2. Identify the path where the certificate was downloaded and convert it into a Kubernetes secret with the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl create secret generic example.com --from-file="$HOME/.cloudflared/cert.pem"
```

3. Ensure the secret was generated successfully with the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl get secret
```

4. The output will list the secret and its details in the following format:

```txt
NAME                TYPE         DATA AGE
----                ----         ---- ---
example.com         opaque       3    42s
```

## Pod configuration

Kubernetes can use YAML files to configure the settings for the
deployment of a Pod to a given cluster. In the sidecar model,
`cloudflared` must be defined as a "kind: Deployment" section. The
configuration file must include the arguments used to start Argo Tunnel,
as well as the reference to the generated secret.

Additionally, you will need to use the flag `--no-auto-update` to ensure that the
`cloudflared` update process does not cause the container to crash on launch. In
some cases, the auto-update flow can cause the container to launch a new process
as PID 1, which causes the container to crash.

The example file above defines the deployment of "hello" as both a
container and a service that will serve requests on port 8080. Below those
definitions, the file sets arguments for `cloudflared`
`--url` specifies the destination of proxied requests
`--hostname` specifies the DNS hostname exposed to the public internet
