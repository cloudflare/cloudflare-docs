# DNS over HTTPS

The `cloudflared` client also supports doing DNS over an encrypted HTTPS connection instead of using the default DNS resolver configured for your server/container/VM/environment.

Instructions are available here for how to run the `cloudflared` DNS over HTTPS proxy [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/cloudflared-proxy/).
