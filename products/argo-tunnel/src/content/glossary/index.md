# Glossary

## [Cloudflare for Teams](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams-home/)
Cloudflare for Teams brings the power of Cloudflare’s global network to your internal teams and infrastructure. Teams empowers users with secure, fast and seamless access to any device on the Internet.

## [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/access/)
Cloudflare Access replaces corporate VPNs with Cloudflare’s network. Instead of placing internal tools on a private network, customers deploy them in any environment, including hybrid or multi-cloud models, and secure them consistently with Cloudflare’s network.

## [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/gateway/)
Cloudflare Gateway is a modern next generation firewall between your user, device or network and the public Internet. Once you setup Cloudflare Gateway, Gateway's DNS filtering service will inspect all Internet bound DNS queries, log them and apply corresponding policies.

## [Argo Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/)
A secure outbound connection which runs in your infrastructure to connect the applications and machines to Cloudflare.

## [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)
Cloudflare Workers provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

---------------

## Access App Launch
The Access App Launch portal provides end users with a single dashboard from which they can open applications secured by Access.

## Active zone
A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator. For a domain to be active on Cloudflare, its nameservers need to be changed to Cloudflare's.

## Authenticated Origin Pulls

Authenticated Origin Pulls let origin web servers validate that a web request came from Cloudflare. Cloudflare uses TLS client certificate authentication, a feature supported by most web servers, to present a Cloudflare certificate when establishing a connection between Cloudflare and the origin web server.

## cloudflared

`cloudflared` is the software that powers Argo Tunnel. `cloudflared` runs alongside origin servers to connect to Cloudflare's network, as well as client devices for non-HTTP traffic from user endpoints.

## DoH
*DNS over HTTPS*

With DoH, DNS queries and responses are encrypted, and they are sent via the HTTP or HTTP/2 protocols. Like [DoT](#DoT), DoH ensures that attackers can't forge or alter DNS traffic. DoH traffic looks like other HTTPS traffic – e.g. normal user-driven interactions with websites and web apps – from a network administrator's perspective.

## DNS filtering

DNS filtering is the process of using the Domain Name System to block malicious websites and filter out harmful or inappropriate content. This ensures that company data remains secure and allows companies to have control over what their employees can access on company-managed networks. DNS filtering is often part of a larger access control strategy.

## DNS server

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

## DoT <a name="DoT"></a>
*DNS over TLS*

DNS over TLS, or DoT, is a standard for encrypting DNS queries to keep them secure and private. DoT uses the same security protocol, TLS, that HTTPS websites use to encrypt and authenticate communications. (TLS is also known as "SSL.") DoT adds TLS encryption on top of the user datagram protocol (UDP), which is used for DNS queries. Additionally, it ensures that DNS requests and responses are not tampered with or forged via on-path attacks.

## hostname
The name given to a server or node on a network. In most cases, the public DNS name of a server.

## IdP
*identity provider*

An identity provider (IdP or IDP) stores and manages users' digital identities. Think of an IdP as being like a guest list, but for digital and cloud-hosted applications instead of an event. An IdP may check user identities via username-password combinations and other factors, or it may simply provide a list of user identities that another service provider (like an SSO) checks.

## JWT
*JSON web token*

An open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## mTLS
*mutual TLS*

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network.

## Next-generation firewall
A next-generation firewall (NGFW) is more powerful than a traditional firewall. NGFWs have the capabilities of traditional firewalls, but they also have a host of added features to address a greater variety of organizational needs. NGFWs can run either in the cloud or on-premises.

## OAuth
OAuth is a technical standard for authorizing users. It is a protocol for passing authorization from one service to another without sharing the actual user credentials, such as a username and password. With OAuth, a user can sign in on one platform and then be authorized to perform actions and view data on another platform.

## OpenID Connect

A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner. (From: [source](https://openid.net/connect/))
