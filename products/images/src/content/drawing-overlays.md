# Drawing overlays & watermarks

You can draw additional images on top of a resized image, with transparency and blending effects. This enables adding of watermarks, logos, signatures, vignettes, and other effects to resized images.

This feature is available only in [Workers](/resizing-with-workers). To draw overlay images, add an array of drawing commands to options of `fetch()` requests. The drawing options are nested in `options.cf.image.draw`, like this:

```js
fetch(imageURL, {
  cf: {
    image: {
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
      draw: [{
        url: "https://example.com/branding/logo.png", // draw this image
        bottom: 5, // 5 pixels from the bottom edge
        right: 5, // 5 pixels from the right edge
        fit: "contain", // make it fit within 100x50 area
        width: 100,
        height: 50,
        opacity: 0.8, // 20% transparent
      }]
    }
  }
})
```

## Drawing options

The `draw` property is an array. Overlays are drawn in the order they appear in the array (last array entry is the topmost layer). Each item in the `draw` array is an object, which can have the following properties:

<Definitions>

- `url`
  - Absolute URL of the image file to use for the drawing. It can be any of the supported file formats. For drawing of watermarks or non-rectangular overlays we recommend using PNG or WebP images.

- `width` and __`height`__
  - Maximum size of the overlay image, in pixels. It must be an integer.

- `fit` and __`gravity`__
  - Affects interpretation of `width` and `height`. Same as [for the main image](/resizing-with-workers/#fetch-options).

- `opacity`
  - Floating-point number between `0` (transparent) and `1` (opaque). For example, `opacity: 0.5` makes overlay semitransparent.

- `repeat`
  - If set to `true`, the overlay image will be tiled to cover the entire area. This is useful for stock-photo-like watermarks.

    If set to `"x"`, the overlay image will be tiled horizontally only (form a line).

    If set to `"y"`, the overlay image will be tiled vertically only (form a line).

- `top`, __`left`__, __`bottom`__, __`right`__
  - Position of the overlay image relative to a given edge. Each property is an offset in pixels. `0` aligns exactly to the edge. For example, `left: 10` positions left side of the overlay 10 pixels from the left edge of the image itâ€™s drawn over. `bottom: 0` aligns bottom of the overlay with bottom of the background image.

    Setting both `left` & `right`, or both `top` & `bottom` is an error.

    If no position is specified, the image will be centered.

- `background`
  - Background color to add underneath the overlay image. Same as [for the main image](/resizing-with-workers/#fetch-options).

- `rotate`
  - Number of degrees to rotate the overlay image by. Same as [for the main image](/resizing-with-workers/#fetch-options).

## Examples

### Stock Photo Watermark

```js
image: {
  draw: [{
    url: "https://example.com/watermark.png",
    repeat: true, // Tiled over entire image
    opacity: 0.2, // and subtly blended
  }]
}
```

### Signature

```js
image: {
  draw: [{
    url: "https://example.com/by-me.png", // Predefined logo/signature
    bottom: 5, // Positioned near bottom right corner
    right: 5,
  }]
}
```

### Centered icon

```js
image: {
  draw: [{
    url: "https://example.com/play-button.png",
    // Center position is the default
  }]
}
```

### Combined

Multiple operations can be combined in one image:

```js
image: {
  draw: [
    {url: "https://example.com/watermark.png", repeat: true, opacity: 0.2},
    {url: "https://example.com/play-button.png"},
    {url: "https://example.com/by-me.png", bottom: 5, right: 5},
  ]
}
```
