# Cloudflare Image Resizing docs

<ContentColumn>

You can transform images on Cloudflare’s edge platform. You can resize, adjust quality, and convert images to WebP or AVIF format on demand. We’ll automatically cache every derived image at the edge, so you only need to store one original image at your origin.

- Quickly and easily adapt images to your site’s layout and your visitors’ screen sizes without maintaining a server-side image processing pipeline on your servers.

- Image processing [integrates well with Workers](/resizing-with-workers), which enables advanced integrations such as custom URL schemes, content negotiation and responsive images based on Client Hints.

## Two ways to use

You can use Cloudflare Image Resizing with either a pre-defined [URL format](/url-format) or with [Cloudflare Workers](/resizing-with-workers), for advanced use-cases.

Image Resizing is available today for Business and Enterprise Customers. To enable it, login to the Cloudflare Dashboard and navigate to the Speed Tab. There you’ll find the section for Image Resizing which you can enable with one click.
