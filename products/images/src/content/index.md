# Cloudflare Image Optimization

Choose between Cloudflare Images and Cloudflare Image Resizing, two products tailored to your different needs.

With Cloudflare Images you can build a scalable image pipeline on Cloudflare servers, to store, resize, optimize, and deliver images in a fast and secure manner.

With Image Resizing you can use Cloudflareâ€™s edge platform to resize, adjust quality, and convert images to WebP or AVIF format on demand, independently of where they are stored.
