# Cloudflare API Security

Cloudflare offers a range of products to help identify and address API vulnerabilities.

## Why care about API security?

APIs have become the [backbone of popular web services](https://blog.postman.com/intro-to-apis-history-of-apis/), helping the Internet become more accessible and useful.

As APIs have become more prevalent, however, so have their problems:
- Many companies have [thousands of APIs](products/api-discovery), including ones they do not even know about.
- To support a large base of users, many APIs are protected by a [negative security model](products/api-shield) that makes them vulnerable to credential-stuffing attacks and automated scanning tools.
- With so many endpoints and users, itâ€™s difficult to recognize brute-force attacks against [specific endpoints](products/volumetric-abuse-detection).
- Sophisticated attacks are even harder to recognize, often because even development teams are unaware of common and uncommon [usage patterns](products/sequential-abuse-detection).

## Features

Cloudflare offers the following features to help learn about and secure your APIs:
