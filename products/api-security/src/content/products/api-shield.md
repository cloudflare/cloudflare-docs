# API Shield™

Cloudflare API Shield allows you to secure your APIs using the following security solutions:

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** — Blocks traffic from devices that do not have a valid client SSL/TLS certificate with an API Shield rule.
- **Schema Validation** — Protects your origin from invalid API requests or a malicious payload by matching each request with the provided schema.

For more details, see the full [API Shield documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/api-shield).
