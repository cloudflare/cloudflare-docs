# What's new?

Welcome to the brand new **Cloudflare for Teams documentation**.

Starting on **February 8, 2021**, this space will replace the separate, independent documentation sections for [Cloudflare Access](/glossary#cloudflare-access), [Cloudflare Gateway](/glossary#cloudflare-gateway), [Argo Tunnel](/glossary#argo-tunnel), and [WARP client for Teams](/glossary#warp-client).

## The new structure

We want your experience with our documentation to be as intuitive and as seamless as possible. This is why we decided to provide you with documentation that really is about what Teams can do, rather than any specific product. The days of jumping in between product sections are over. 

The new Cloudflare for Teams documentation is structured around six main topics:

* [**Documentation on setting up Teams**](/setup). 
* [**Documentation on Identity**](/identity). This section covers the Teams features you can use to manage, grant or deny access to users (and systems) based on **user identity** and **device health**. 
* [**Documentation on connecting to Teams**](/connections). This section covers how to connect  applications, networks or devices to Teams, with the WARP client or with agentless solutions.
* [**Documentation on Applications**](/applications). This section covers the different types of applications that can be connected to Teams, and how to add and manage these applications.
* [**Documentation on Policies**](/policies). This section covers the different types of rules admins can configure to control network activity, and how to build these rules on the dashboard.
* [**API-related documentation**](/api-terraform). This section covers how to manage Access with the API and Terraform.
* [**Documentation on Analytics**](/analytics). This section explains- our analytics pages on the Teams dash.
