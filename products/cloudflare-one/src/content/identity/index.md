# Identity

Cloudflare for Teams integrates with your organization's identity provider to apply Zero Trust and Secure Web Gateway policies. If you work with partners, contractors, or other organizations, you can integrate multiple identity providers simultaneously.

You can also build rules based on device posture using mutual TLS authentication, third party integrations, or the Cloudflare WARP client.
