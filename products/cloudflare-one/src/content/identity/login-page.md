# Login page

Under **Settings > General**, you can customize the login page your end users will see when trying to reach applications behind Teams. 

Click **Customize** to give the login page the look and feel of your organization by adding your organization's name and by choosing a custom header and footer, a logo, and a preferred background color.

Any changes you make will be reflected in real time in the **Preview** card. Once youâ€™re satisfied with your customization, click **Save**.

Your login page will now reflect your changes.
