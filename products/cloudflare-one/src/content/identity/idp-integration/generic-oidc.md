# Generic OIDC

Cloudflare Access has a generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) connector to help you integrate IdPs not already set in Access.

## Setting up a generic OIDC

To set up a generic OIDC:

1. Visit your identity provider and create a client/app.

1. When creating a client/app, your IdP may request an **authorized redirect URI**. Enter your [team domain](/glossary#team-domain) followed by this callback at the end of the path: `/cdn-cgi/access/callback`. For example:

    ```txt
    https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
    ```

1. Copy the content of these fields:
   * Client ID
   * Client secret
   * Auth URL: The `authorization_endpoint` URL of your IdP
   * Token URL: The token_endpoint URL of your IdP
   * Certificate URL: The `jwks_uri` endpoint of your IdP to allow the IdP keys to sign the tokens

    You can find these values on your identity provider’s **OIDC discovery endpoint**. Some providers call this the “well-known URL.”

1. On the Teams dashboard, navigate to **Settings > Authentication**.
1. Under **Login methods**, click **Add new**.

1. Choose **OpenID Connect** on the next page.

1. In the **Name** field, enter your IdP. Then, paste in the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. To test that your connection is working, navigate to **Authentication > Login methods** and click **Test** next to the login method you want to test.

On success, a confirmation screen displays.
