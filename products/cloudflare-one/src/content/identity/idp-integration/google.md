# Google

You can integrate Google authentication with Cloudflare Access without a Google Workspace account. The integration will allow any user with a Google account to login (if the [Zero Trust policy](/policies/zero-trust) allows them to reach the resource). Unlike the instructions for [Google Workspace](/identity/idp-integration/gsuite), the steps below will not allow you to pull group membership information from a Google Workspace account.

Please note that you don't need to be a Google Cloud Platform user to integrate Google Suite as an identity provider with Cloudflare for Teams. You will only need to open the Google Cloud Platform to access settings for your OIDC identity provider.

1. Visit the Google Cloud Platform console. Create a new project.

 ![Create Project](../../static/documentation/identity/google/create-project.png)

1. Name the project and click **Create**.

 ![Name Project](../../static/documentation/identity/google/name-project.png)

1. On the project home page that loads, select `APIs & Services` from the sidebar and click **Dashboard**.

 ![Name Project](../../static/documentation/identity/google/click-api-dash.png)

1. You will first need to configure a consent screen. Click **Configure Consent Screen** at the top of the page.

 ![Click Consent](../../static/documentation/identity/google/click-configure-consent.png)

1. Choose `External` as the User Type. Since this application is not being created in a Google Workspace account, the only types of users are external.

1. Name the application and add a support email (GCP will require you to add an email in your account).

 ![Name App](../../static/documentation/identity/google/name-app.png)

 You will also be prompted to input contact fields.

1. In the **Scopes** section, we recommend adding the `userinfo.email` scope. This is not required for the integration to work, but will indicate to users authenticating what information is being gathered.

 ![Scopes](../../static/documentation/identity/google/scopes.png)

 You do not need to add test users.

 You can review the summary information and return to the dashboard at the bottom of the page.

1. Return to the **APIs & Services** page and click *+ Create Credentials*. Select `OAuth client ID`.

 ![Create OAuth](../../static/documentation/identity/google/create-oauth.png)

1. Name the application.

 ![Name OAuth](../../static/documentation/identity/google/name-oauth.png)

1. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, in the **URIs** field, enter your [team domain](/glossary#team-domain). 

1. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, in the **URIs** field, enter your team domain followed by this callback at the end of the path: `/cdn-cgi/access/callback`. For example:

    ```txt
    https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
    ```

 ![Team Domain](../../static/documentation/identity/google/auth-domain.png)

1. Google will present the OAuth Client ID and Secret values. The secret field functions like a password and should not be shared. For the purposes of this tutorial, the secret field is kept visible. Copy both values.

1. On the Teams dashboard, navigate to **Settings > Authentication**.

1. Under **Login methods**, click **Add new**.

1. Choose **Google** on the next page.

1. Input the Client ID and Client Secret fields generated previously.

1. Click **Save**.

To test that your connection is working, navigate to **Authentication > Login methods** and click **Test** next to Google.

Your user identity should return.
