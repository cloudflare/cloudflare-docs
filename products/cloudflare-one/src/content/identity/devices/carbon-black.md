    * **Name:** A unique identifier for this Carbon Black device posture check
    * **Operating system:** You’ll need to configure one posture check per operating system (Mac and Windows currently supported)
    * **Application Path:** This will pre-populate with the default application path but can be edited if you have installed in a non-standard location
    * **Certificate thumbprint (optional):** The thumbprint of your Carbon Black instance’s certificate.
    * **SHA256 checksum (optional):** Used to validate the SHA256 signature of your Carbon Black instance.
