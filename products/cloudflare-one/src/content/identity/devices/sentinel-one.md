Cloudflare for Teams can check if [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/) is running on a device to determine if a request should be allowed to reach a protected resource.

1. Select **+Add**.

1. Select **SentinelOne**.

1. You will be prompted for the following information:

    * **Name:** A unique identifier for this SentinelOne device posture check
    * **Operating system:** You’ll need to configure one posture check per operating system (Mac and Windows currently supported)
    * **Application Path:** This will pre-populate with the default application path but can be edited if you have installed in a non-standard location
    * **Certificate thumbprint (optional):** The thumbprint of your SentinelOne instance’s certificate.
    * **SHA256 checksum (optional):** Used to validate the SHA256 signature of your SentinelOne instance.

1. Once you have configured your SentinelOne instance, you can then add SentinelOne device posture checks to any application protected by Access.
