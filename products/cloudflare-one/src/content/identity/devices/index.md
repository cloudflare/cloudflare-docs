# Device posture

Cloudflare for Teams can integrate with endpoint protection providers to check requests for device posture. This allows you to configure security policies that rely on additional signals from endpoint security providers to allow or deny connections to your applications. 

When device posture checks are configured, users will only be allowed to connect to a protected application when they are using a managed or healthy device, as determined by the endpoint security provider.
