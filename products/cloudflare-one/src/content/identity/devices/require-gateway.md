# Require Gateway

Cloudflare for Teams allows you to restrict access to your applications to devices whose traffic is filtered by your organization's Cloudflare Gateway configuration. Unlike [Require WARP](/identity/devices/require-warp), which will check for any WARP instance, this will allow only request from your organization's specific Gateway implementation.

The process involves two steps:

1. Setting up **Require Gateway** as a device posture check.
1. Adding the check to new or existing [Zero Trust policies](/policies/zero-trust) to enforce the check for one or more of your applications.

## Set up a device posture check

1. On your [Teams dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/), navigate to **My Team > Devices > Device Posture**.

    ![Device Posture](../../static/documentation/identity/devices/device-posture.png)

1. Select **Gateway**. 

1. Click **Save**.


You are now ready to start requiring Gateway for your Access applications.

## Add the check to a Zero Trust policy

1. On the Teams dashboard, navigate to **Access > Applications**.

1. Locate the application for which you want to require Gateway.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. To have an existing policy require Gateway, click **Edit** for that specific policy. Then, add an **Include** or **Require** rule with the option *Gateway* selected.

1. Click **Save rule**.

Before granting access to the application, your policy will now check that the user is running your organization's Gateway configuration, or the WARP client, on their machine.
