# Policies

<ContentColumn>

<Aside> 

Policies are sets of rules that allow you to control:
* **Inbound** requests to your applications, with **Access**
* **Outbound** traffic to the Internet, with **Gateway**

Cloudflare for Teams allows your organization to control inbound requests to your applications, as well as outbound traffic to the Internet. Policies also allow you to block security threats and potentially malicious websites.

Let's dive into what you can do with policies in both products.
