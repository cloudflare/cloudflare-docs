# Setup

Browser Isolation is enabled through Secure Web Gateway HTTP policies. By default, no traffic is isolated until an Isolation policy has been added within HTTP policies. To start isolating your traffic, you need to:

1. Create a [Cloudflare for Teams account](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/) and select Browser Isolation as an add-on to either your Teams Standard or your Teams Enterprise plan.

1. Download the latest version of the [WARP client](/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp).

1. Create a [Device enrollment rule](/connections/connect-devices/warp/warp-settings#device-enrollment-permissions).

1. Set up an [Isolation policy](/policies/filtering/http-policies/#isolate).

Cloudflare Browser Isolation integrates with your existing web browser. Once connected to Cloudflare WARP, open your browser and navigate to any websites you normally use.

Every tab is automatically connected to an isolated browser running on Cloudflare's edge.

## How to check if a webpage is isolated

The easiest way to check if a webpage is proxied through Cloudflare is by checking for the presence of a Cloudflare Root CA.

In Chrome, click the padlock to the left of your address bar and select **Certificate**.

### Normal Browsing

**Non-Cloudflare Root CA**. Non-Cloudflare for Teams root certificate indicates that Cloudflare did not proxy this webpage.
