# Configuration file

<Aside type="note">

If you are running [quick tunnels](/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms#quick-tunnels), you do not need a configuration file.

</Aside>

Configuring tunnels through a YAML file (what we refer to as a [configuration file](/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms#configuration-file)) allows you to have fine-grained control over how an instance of `cloudflared` will operate. In your configuration file you can specify top-level properties for your `cloudflared` instance, as well as configure origin-specific properties by writing [ingress rules](/connect-apps/configuration/configuration-file/ingress) and adding parameters to them.

In the absence of a configuration file, `cloudflared` will proxy outbound traffic through port 8080.  

## File structure

The structure of a configuration file will be different depending on the type of resource you want to expose to the Internet. 

### Top-level configurations

When creating a configuration file, it is best practice to list `tunnel` and `credentials-file` as your first key/value pairs. Whether you are exposing an application or a network on the Internet, it is common to list these keys as the first ones in your configuration file:


```txt
tunnel: The tunnel UUID
credentials-file: /path/your-tunnels-credentials-file.json
```

If you’re [exposing a private network](/connections/connect-apps/configuration/private-networks), you need to add the `warp-routing` key and set it to `true`:

```txt
tunnel: The tunnel UUID
credentials-file: /path/your-tunnels-credentials-file.json
warp-routing:
    enabled: true
```

### Ingress rules

Once your top-level configuration is complete, you can begin addressing origin-specific configurations. By writing ingress rules in the configuration file, you can specify which local services a request should be proxied to.

Refer to the [ingress rules page](/connections/connect-apps/configuration/configuration-file/ingress) for more information on writing ingress rules and how they work.

## Creating a configuration file

You can create your configuration file using any text editor. For example, to create a configuration file in the [default `cloudflared` directory](#storing-a-configuration-file) with vim:

1. `cd` into your system's default directory for `cloudflared`.
1. Open vim and type in the necessary [keys and values](#keys-and-values).
1. Name and save your file by typing `:wq file-name.yaml` and exit vim.

Confirm that the configuration file has been successfully created by running:

```sh
$ cat config.yaml 
```

## Storing a configuration file

`cloudflared` will automatically look for the configuration file in the [default `cloudflared` directory](/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms#default-cloudflared-directory). However, you can store your configuration file in any directory of your choice.

## Referencing a configuration file

Before you run a tunnel, ensure you have created a configuration file for `cloudflared` to know what configuration to follow when routing traffic through the tunnel. When running a tunnel, make sure you specify the path to your configuration file:

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel run --config /path/your-config-file.yaml run tunnel-name
```
