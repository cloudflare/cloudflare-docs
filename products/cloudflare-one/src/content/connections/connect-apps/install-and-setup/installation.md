<Aside>

Instances of `cloudflared` do not automatically update on Windows. You will need to perform manual updates.

## Docker

A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared).

## Update `cloudflared`

You can update cloudflared by running the following command.

```bash
cloudflared update
```

The update will cause `cloudflared` to restart which would impact traffic currently being served. You can perform zero-downtime upgrades by using Cloudflare's Load Balancer product or by using multiple `cloudflared` instances.

### Updating with Cloudflare Load Balancer

You can update `cloudflared` without downtime by using Cloudflare's Load Balancer product with your Cloudflare Tunnel deployment.

1. Install a new instance of `cloudflared` and [create](/connections/connect-apps/create-tunnel) a new Tunnel.
2. Configure the instance to point traffic to the same locally-available service as your current, active instance of `cloudflared`.
3. [Add the address](/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb) of the new instance of `cloudflared` into your Load Balancer pool as priority 2.
4. Swap the priority such that the new instance is now priority 1 and monitor to confirm traffic is being served.
5. Once confirmed, you can remove the older version from the Load Balancer pool.

### Updating with multiple `cloudflared` instances

If you are not using Cloudflare's Load Balancer, you can use multiple instances of `cloudflared` to update without the risk of downtime.

1. Install a new instance of `cloudflared` and [create](/connections/connect-apps/create-tunnel) a new Tunnel.
2. Configure the instance to point traffic to the same locally-available service as your current, active instance of `cloudflared`.
3. In the Cloudflare DNS dashboard, [replace](/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/dns) the address of the current instance of `cloudflared` with the address of the new instance. Save the record.
4. Remove the now-inactive instance of `cloudflared`.

#### Running multiple instances in Windows

Windows systems require services to have a unique name and display name. You can run multiple instances of `cloudflared` by creating `cloudflared` services with unique names.

First, install and configure `cloudflared`. Next, create a service with a unique name and point to the `cloudflared` executable and configuration file.

```bash
sc.exe create <unique-name> binPath='<path-to-exe>' --config '<path-to-config>' displayname="Unique Name"
```

Proceed to create additional services with unique names. You can now start each unique service.

```bash
sc.exe start <unique-name>
```
