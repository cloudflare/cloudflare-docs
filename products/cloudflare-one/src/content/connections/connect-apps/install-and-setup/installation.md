# Install `cloudflared`

Cloudflare Tunnel requires the installation of a lightweight server-side daemon, `cloudflared`, to connect your infrastructure to Cloudflare. `cloudflared` is an [open source project](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) maintained by Cloudflare.

Releases can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases). Downloads are available as standalone binaries or packages like Debian and RPM.

### `.deb` install

Use the `deb` package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines. `amd64 / x86-64` package in this example. 

```bash
wget -q https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
dpkg -i cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
```

### `.rpm` install

Use the `rpm` package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatable machines. `amd64 / x86-64` is used in this example. 

```bash
wget -q https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.rpm
rpm -ivh cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.rpm
```

### Build from source

You can also build the latest version of `cloudflared` from source with the following steps.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared.git
$ cd cloudflared
$ make cloudflared
$ go install github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/cmd/cloudflared
```

Depending on where you installed `cloudflared`, you can move it to a known path as well.

```bash
mv /root/cloudflared/cloudflared /usr/bin/cloudflared
```

## Docker

A Docker image of `cloudflared` is [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared).

## macOS

You can install `cloudflared` on macOS systems via Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Alternatively, you can [download the latest Darwin amd64 release directly](https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-darwin-amd64.zip).

## Windows

Type   | 32-bit | 64-bit |
-------|----------------|-----|
ZIP | [Download](https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-windows-386.zip) | [Download](https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-windows-amd64.zip) |

Once `cloudflared` is installed:
1. Navigate to the **Downloads** folder.
2. Right-click on the ZIP folder and select `Extract All` to extract the executable.
3. Next, open PowerShell.
4. Navigate to the same Downloads folder.
5. Run the `cloudflared.exe` executable as an administrator to confirm the installation, replacing the path in the example below with the specifics of your directory:

```bash
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\cloudflared-stable-windows-amd64> .\cloudflared.exe --version
```

The command above should output the version of `cloudflared` if successfully installed.

<Aside>

Instances of `cloudflared` do not automatically update on Windows. You will need to perform manual updates.

## Build from source

You can also build the latest version of `cloudflared` from source with the following steps.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared.git
$ cd cloudflared
$ make cloudflared
$ go install github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/cmd/cloudflared
```

Depending on where you installed `cloudflared`, you can move it to a known path as well.

```bash
mv /root/cloudflared/cloudflared /usr/bin/cloudflared
```

## Updating `cloudflared`

You can update cloudflared by running the following command.

```bash
cloudflared update
```

The update will cause `cloudflared` to restart which would impact traffic currently being served. You can perform zero-downtime upgrades by using Cloudflare's Load Balancer product or by using multiple `cloudflared` instances.

### Updating with Cloudflare Load Balancer

You can update `cloudflared` without downtime by using Cloudflare's Load Balancer product with your Cloudflare Tunnel deployment.

1. Install a new instance of `cloudflared` and [create](/connections/connect-apps/create-tunnel) a new Tunnel.
2. Configure the instance to point traffic to the same locally-available service as your current, active instance of `cloudflared`.
3. [Add the address](/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb) of the new instance of `cloudflared` into your Load Balancer pool as priority 2.
4. Swap the priority such that the new instance is now priority 1 and monitor to confirm traffic is being served.
5. Once confirmed, you can remove the older version from the Load Balancer pool.

### Updating with multiple `cloudflared` instances

If you are not using Cloudflare's Load Balancer, you can use multiple instances of `cloudflared` to update without the risk of downtime.

1. Install a new instance of `cloudflared` and [create](/connections/connect-apps/create-tunnel) a new Tunnel.
2. Configure the instance to point traffic to the same locally-available service as your current, active instance of `cloudflared`.
3. In the Cloudflare DNS dashboard, [replace](/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/dns) the address of the current instance of `cloudflared` with the address of the new instance. Save the record.
4. Remove the now-inactive instance of `cloudflared`.


#### Running multiple instances in Windows

Windows systems require services to have a unique name and display name. You can run multiple instances of `cloudflared` by creating `cloudflared` services with unique names.

First, install and configure `cloudflared`. Next, create a service with a unique name and point to the `cloudflared` executable and configuration file.

```bash
sc.exe create <unique-name> binPath='<path-to-exe>' --config '<path-to-config>' displayname="Unique Name"
```

Proceed to create additional services with unique names. You can now start each unique service.

```bash
sc.exe start <unique-name>
```

## Deprecated versions
