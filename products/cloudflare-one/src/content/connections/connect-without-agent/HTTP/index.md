# Connect to the L7 Firewall

In the future, Cloudflare Gateway will support the ability for organizations to connect to the L7 firewall directly, without the use of the Cloudflare for Teams client, through the deployment of a PAC file. Today, organizations must connect to Cloudflare Gateway with the Teams client and the user must be enrolled in a Gateway organization with a paid subscription in order to receive protections from HTTP traffic filtering.
