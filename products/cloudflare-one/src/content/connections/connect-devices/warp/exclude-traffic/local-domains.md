# Local Domain Fallback
 
<Aside>
 
In order for the WARP client to pick up any changes you make to Split Tunnels or Local Domain Fallback, you will need to restart it. To do that, you can either restart the computer or quit the application and relaunch it. This behavior will be improved in a future release.
 
</Aside>
 
By default, Cloudflare for Teams excludes common top level domains used for local resolution from being sent to the Cloudflare proxy. Excluded domains are listed on the Teams dashboard under **Gateway** > **Policies** > **Settings** > **Local Domains - WARP**. All domains in that list rely on the local DNS resolver configured for the device.
 
You can add or remove domains from the Local Domains list at any time.
 
 
1. On the Teams dashboard, navigate to **Policies** > **Settings**.
