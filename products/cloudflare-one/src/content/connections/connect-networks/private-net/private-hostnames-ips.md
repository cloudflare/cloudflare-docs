# Private hostnames and IPs

Building out a private network has two primary components: the infrastructure side, and the client side.

The infrastructure side of the equation is powered by Cloudflare Tunnel, which connects your infrastructure to Cloudflare — whether that be a singular application, many applications, or an entire network segment. This is made possible by running `cloudflared` in your environment to establish multiple secure, outbound-only, load-balanced links to Cloudflare.

On the client side, your end users need to be able to easily connect to Cloudflare and, more importantly, your network. This connection is handled by Cloudflare WARP. This client can be rolled out to your entire organization in just a few minutes using your in-house MDM tooling, and it establishes a secure connection from your users’ devices to the Cloudflare network.

In this page, we will cover how to define your internal DNS resolver with Cloudflare for Teams, and how to create a new Private IP/Hostname application in Cloudflare Access.

## Before you start

* Cloudflare Tunnel must be properly [configured](/connections/connect-apps/configuration) to route traffic to a private IP space.
* `cloudflared` must be connected to Cloudflare from your target private network.
* Cloudflare WARP must be installed on end-user devices to connect your users to Cloudflare.

## Enable UDP support

1. On the [Teams dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com), navigate to **Settings** > **Network**.
1. Scroll down to Firewall settings.
1. Ensure the Proxy is enabled and both TCP and UDP are selected.

## Create a Local Domain Fallback entry

Next, we need to create a [Local Domain Fallback](/connections/connect-devices/warp/exclude-traffic/local-domains) entry.

1. Remain in Network Settings and scroll further down to **Local Domain Fallback**.
1. Click **Manage**.
1. Create a new Local Domain Fallback entry pointing to the internal DNS resolver. The rule in the following example instructs the WARP client to resolve all requests for `myorg.internal` through an internal resolver at `10.0.0.25` rather than attempting to resolve this publicly.

<Aside type='note'>

While on the Network Settings page, ensure that **Split Tunnels** are configured to include traffic to private IPs and hostnames in the traffic sent by WARP to Cloudflare. For guidance on how to do that, refer to [these instructions](/connections/connect-networks/private-net#optional-ensure-that-traffic-can-reach-your-network).

## Update your `cloudflared` configuration

Next, update your Cloudflare Tunnel configuration to ensure it is using QUIC as the default transport protocol. To do this, you can either set the `protocol: QUIC` property in your [configuration file](/connections/connect-apps/configuration/configuration-file) or [pass the `–-protocol quic` flag](/connections/connect-apps/configuration/arguments) directly through your CLI. 

Finally, update `cloudflared` on your target private network to the latest available version.

You can now resolve requests through the internal DNS server you set up in your private network. 

## Test the conection

For testing, run a `dig` command for the internal DNS service. Here is an example for a Private DNS Resolver listening on a Private IP `10.0.0.25` and on Port 1053, for a private domain to be resolved: 

```sh
$ dig @10.0.0.25 -p 1053 AAAA www.myorg.internal
```

The `dig` will fail if the WARP client is disabled in your end user's device.

## Troubleshooting

If you are encountering issues when setting up private IPs and hostnames for your network:

* Ensure that `cloudflared` is connected to Cloudflare by visiting **Access** > **Tunnels** in the Cloudflare for Teams dashboard.

* Ensure that end-user devices are enrolled into WARP by visiting `help.teams.cloudflare.com` on those devices. The page should return `Your network is fully protected`.

* Ensure that the machine where `cloudflared` is running is allowed to egress via UDP to port 7844 to talk out to Cloudflare.

* Double-check the precedence of your application policies in the **Gateway** > **Policies** > **Network policies** tab. Ensure that a more global Block or Allow policy will not supercede the application policies

* Ensure your Private DNS resolver is available over a routable private IP address.

* Ensure UDP proxying is turned on if you are using Private DNS to define the application.

* Ensure requests to a private IP or hostname are reaching Cloudflare Tunnel by viewing requests in the Gateway Network Logs.
