# Locations

Locations are usually physical entities like offices, homes, retail stores, movie theatres, or data centers. The fastest way to start sending DNS queries from a location and protect it from security threats is by changing the DNS resolvers at the router to the dedicated IPv6 addresses for those locations.

If you donâ€™t have IPv6 network, you can set up a location by adding the source IP for the location and changing the DNS resolvers to:

* **172.64.36.1**
* **172.64.36.2**

If you want to send your DNS queries over an encrypted connection, you can use the hostname that we provide in the dashboard to send queries using DNS over HTTPS.

## How Gateway matches queries to locations

Gateway uses different ways to match a DNS query to locations depending on the type of request and network. This is how Gateway determines the location of a DNS query:

1. **Step 1**: Gateway checks whether the query was sent using DNS over HTTPS. If yes, Gateway looks up the location by its unique hostname. 

2. **Step 2**: if the query wasn't sent with DNS over HTTPS, Gateway checks whether it was sent over IPv4. If yes, it looks up the location by the source IPv4 address.

3. **Step 3**: If the query wasn't sent over IPv4, it means it was sent over IPv6. Gateway will look up the location associated with the DNS query based on the destination IPv6 address.
