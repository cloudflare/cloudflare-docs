# Extensions

Browser Isolation supports running native Chromium Web Extensions in the remote browser.

This capability allows extending tools that require DOM access (such as password managers and ad-blockers) to isolated pages.

## Install an extension inside the remote browser

### Prerequisite: Isolate Chrome Web Store

Installing extensions requires that the Chrome Web Store is isolated, first create an [HTTP policy](/policies/filtering/http-policies) that isolates the Chrome Webstore (chrome.google.com).

### Install an extension

- Navigate to https://chrome.google.com/webstore while isolated.
- Find and select your desired extension. 
- Select "Add to Chrome".
- Approve the extension installation by selecting "Add extension".

Remote browser extensions are automatically reinstalled across isolated sessions.

## Removing extensions from the remote browser

Extensions may be uninstalled within the remote browser from any isolated page.

- Navigate to any isolated webpage.
- Right click to open the context menu and select "Show isolation toolbar"
- Within the isolation toolbar on the bottom of the page, select the Jigsaw icon to open the extension manager.
- Select the hamburger icon for the desired extension to open the extension controls.
- Choose "Remove from Chromium..." 
- Select "Remove" to confirm extension uninstallation.
