# Enable third-party cookies

Browser Isolation currently depends on third-party cookies to maintain a short-lived session between your local browser and the remote isolated browser.

Each web browser treats third-party cookies differently, and some browsers (for example, Chrome and Firefox) may only present this error while incognito / private browsing mode is active. Depending on how your browser is configured, you may need to enable third-party cookies to access isolated websites.

1. Scroll down to **Privacy and security**, click **Cookies and other site data**.
1. Click **See all cookies and site data** > **Remove all**.
1. Confirm by clicking **Clear all**.

## Firefox (Private Browsing mode)

1. Open Firefox.
1. Click **Tools** > **Options**.
1. Click **Privacy** in the top panel.

## Safari
