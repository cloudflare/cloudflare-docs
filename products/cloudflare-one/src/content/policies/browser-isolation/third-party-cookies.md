# Enable third-party cookies

Browser Isolation currently depends on third-party cookies to maintain a short-lived session between your local browser and the remote isolated browser.

Each web browser treats third-party cookies differently, and some browsers (for example, Chrome and Firefox) may only present this error while incognito / private browsing mode is active. Depending on how your browser is configured, you may need to enable third-party cookies to access isolated websites.

Follow these instructions to enable third-party cookies in your browser:

1. Go to **Privacy and security** > **Cookies and other site data**.
1. Click **Allow all cookies**.

## Firefox (Private Browsing mode)

1. Open Firefox.
1. Click **Tools** > **Options**.

1. Click **OK**.

## Safari

1. Go to **Preferences** > **Privacy**.
