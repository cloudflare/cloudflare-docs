# Categories

Cloudflare Gateway’s DNS filtering capabilities allow you to block known and potential security threats on the public internet, as well as specific categories of content. To give you more granular control over how to secure your network, Gateway also provides you with categorized security threats and content categories.

You can block security threats and content categories by creating DNS policies. Once you have configured your policies, you will be able to inspect network activity and the associated categories in your Gateway logs.  

## Security threat categories

<Aside>

If you wish to block a hostname or URL that belongs to a security threat category, you need to block that category. If the security threat category is not configured as blocked, requests to that hostname or URL will appear in your Gateway logs as allowed requests.

## Test a policy

If you are blocking a security threat or content category, you can test that the policy is working by using the **test domain** associated with each category.

Once you have configured your Gateway policy to block the category, the test domain will show a block page when you attempt to visit the domain in your browser, or will return `REFUSED` when you perform `dig` using the command-line interface.
