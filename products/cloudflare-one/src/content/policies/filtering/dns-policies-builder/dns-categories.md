# DNS Categories

Cloudflare Gateway’s DNS filtering capabilities allow you to block known and potential security risks on the public Internet, as well as specific categories of content. To give you more granular control over how to secure your network, Gateway also provides you with categorized security risks and content categories.

You can block security risks and content categories by creating DNS policies. Once you have configured your policies, you will be able to inspect network activity and the associated categories in your Gateway logs.  

## DNS Security Categories

<Aside>

If you wish to block a hostname or URL that belongs to a security risk category, you need to block that category. If the security risk category is not configured as blocked, requests to that hostname or URL will appear in your Gateway logs as allowed requests.

## Test a policy

If you are blocking a security threat or content category, you can test that the policy is working by using the **test domain** associated with each category.

Once you have configured your Gateway policy to block the category, the test domain will show a block page when you attempt to visit the domain in your browser, or will return `REFUSED` when you perform `dig` using the command-line interface.

### Test domains

#### One-word categories
Test domains use the following format for categories with one-word names:

```NAME_OF_CATEGORY.testcategory.com```

| Category | Test domain |
| -------- | ----------- |
| *Malware* | `malware.testcategory.com` |
| *Phishing* | `phishing.testcategory.com` |
| *Cryptomining* | `cryptomining.testcategory.com` |

#### Multi-word categories
If the category has multiple words in the name (e.g. *Parked & For Sale Domains*) then the test domain uses the following format:

* Remove any spaces between the words
* Replace `&` with `and`
* All letters are lowercase

| Category | Test domain |
| -------- | ----------- |
| *Parked & For Sale Domains* | `parkedandforsaledomains.testcategory.com` |
| *Private IP Address* | `privateipaddress.testcategory.com` |
| *Command and Control & Botnet* | `commandandcontrolandbotnet.testcategory.com` |

#### Common test domains

| Category | Test domain |
| -------- | ----------- |
| *Anonymizer* | `anonymizer.testcategory.com` |
| *Command and Control & Botnet* | `commandandcontrolandbotnet.testcategory.com` |
| *Cryptomining* | `cryptomining.testcategory.com` |
| *Malware* | `malware.testcategory.com` |
| *New Domains* | `newdomains.testcategory.com` |
| *Parked & For Sale Domains* | `parkedandforsaledomains.testcategory.com` |
| *Phishing* | `phishing.testcategory.com` |
| *Private IP Address* | `privateipaddress.testcategory.com` |
| *Spam* | `spam.testcategory.com` |
