# Applications and app types

Cloudflare Gatewayâ€™s HTTP policies allow you to filter HTTP traffic on the L7 firewall. To make it easier to manage firewall policies for cloud applications, Gateway allows you to build policies based on applications and application types. 

Using these two selectors in the HTTP rule builder, you can have more granular control over how web applications are used on your network.

## Creating rules with applications and app types

1. On the [Teams dashboard](http://dash.teams.cloudflare.com), navigate to **Gateway > Policies**.
1. Navigate to the **HTTP tab**.
1. [Create a new rule](/policies/filtering/http-policies/policy-management#create-your-first-http-policy), or edit an existing one.
1. In the **Selector** drop-down menu, select the *Application* option. 
1. In the **Operator** drop-down menu, select *in* or *not in*, depending on whether you want to include or exclude applications or app types from your rule.
1. In the **Value** drop-down menu, check the applications or app types you would like to control with your rule.

1. Click **Create rule** to finalize your changes.
