# Getting started with Teams

## How do I sign up for Teams?

You can sign up today at [this link](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/teams). Follow the onboarding steps, choose a team name and a payment plan, and start protecting your network in just a few minutes.

## What's a team domain/team name?

Your team domain is a unique subdomain assigned to your Cloudflare account; for example, `<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`. Setting up a team domain is an essential step in your Teams configuration. This is where your users will find the apps you've secured behind Teams — displayed in the [App Launcher](/applications/app-launcher) — and will be able to make login requests to them.  The customizable portion of your team domain is called **team name**. You can change this name at any time in the Teams dashboard, under the **Authentication** tab.

| team name | team domain |
|-------------|-----------|
|  `your-team-name` | `<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` |

## How do I change my subscription plan?

To make changes to your subscription, visit the Billing section under Account on the [Teams Dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/). You can change or cancel your subscription at any time. Just remember - if you downgrade your plan during a billing cycle, your downgraded pricing will apply in the next billing cycle. If you upgrade during a billing cycle, you will be billed for the upgraded plan at the moment you select it. 

## How are active seats measured?

Cloudflare for Teams counts any unique user who authenticated in a calendar month as an active user. This resets at the beginning of each calendar month.

## How do I know if my network is protected behind Teams?

You can visit the [Teams help page](https://help.teams.cloudflare.com). This page will give you an overview of your network details, as well as an overview of the categories that are being blocked and/or allowed.
