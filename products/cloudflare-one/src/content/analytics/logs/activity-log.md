# Activity logs

<Aside>

Activity log will only show the public Source IP address. Private IP addresses are NAT-ed behind a public IP address. 

</Aside>

The Activity log allows you to see individual DNS queries made from your locations or, for paid subscribers, HTTP requests made from WARP clients. You can use the Activity log to investigate anomalies in your network. You can search by the DNS query or HTTP request and investigate each by clicking on a row.

When you click on the row, you can see information related to the identity that is making the DNS request and attributes relevant to the DNS queries.

### Isolate requests

When a user creates a policy to isolate traffic, the initial request that triggers isolation will be logged as an `Isolate` decision, and the `is_isolated` field will return `false`. This is because that initial request is not isolated yet â€” but it initiates an isolated session.

The request is generated in an isolated browser, the result is rendered in the isolated browser and rendered back to the user securely. This request and all subsequent requests in the isolated browser are logged to include the terminal Gateway action that gets applied (e.g. Allow / Block), and the `is_isolated` field as `true`.
