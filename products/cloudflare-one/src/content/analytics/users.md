# User logs

Teams allows you to consult a comprehensive list of users who have authenticated to Teams. For each user that logged in, you can see their name, their email address, and whether they’re actively utilizing a seat in both Access and Gateway.

## Revoke user sessions

Clicking the **Revoke** button will terminate all currently active sessions for that user, and revoke access to all their connected devices. If you want to prevent this user from logging in again, you need to manually remove this user from any existing policies that grant them access to your applications. 

## View user details

Clicking the View button for any user will show you details for that user, such as:
* Their user details
