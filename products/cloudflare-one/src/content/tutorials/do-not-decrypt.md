# Skip inspection for groups of applications

You can configure Cloudflare for Teams to skip inspection for certain groups of applications.

By default, Cloudflare Gateway creates a rule that includes the hostnames used by certain client applications, like Zoom or Apple's services, that rely on certificate pinning. The TLS inspection performed by a service like Cloudflare Gateway will cause errors when users visit those applications.

This tutorial skips inspection for additional applications beyond those in the list curated by Cloudflare.

**üó∫Ô∏è This walkthrough covers how to:**

* Build a `Do not inspect` policy using Cloudflare's list of certificate pinned resources
* Configure that policies precedence in your Gateway configuration

**‚è≤Ô∏è Time to complete:**

5 minutes

## Before you start

1. [Connect devices](/connections/connect-devices/warp) to Cloudflare's edge with the WARP client and [install the root certificate](/connections/connect-devices/warp/install-cloudflare-cert)
1. [Enable web inspection](/connections/connect-devices/warp/warp-settings#enable-proxy)

## Build the policy

Navigate to the **HTTP** tab of the `Policies` page in Cloudflare Gateway. Click **Add a rule**.

Name the policy and, optionally, provide a description.

Under **Selector** choose **Application**. Select **in** in the **Operator field**. This example uses Microsoft 365, categorized as Productivity.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Do Not Inspect** and click **Create rule**.

## Change rule precedence

New rules are saved at the bottom of the rule list in Gateway. Gateway evaluates rules from top-to-bottom, except for do-not-inspect rules. Those are always evaluated first.

We do recommend dragging the **Do Not Inspect** rule to the top of the list to reduce confusion.
