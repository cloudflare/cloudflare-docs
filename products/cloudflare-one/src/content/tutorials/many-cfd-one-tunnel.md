# Use `cloudflared` to expose a Kubernetes app to the Internet

You can use [Cloudflare Tunnel](/connections/connect-apps) to connect applications and servers to Cloudflare's network. Tunnel relies on a piece of software, [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared), to create those connections.

The same Tunnel can be run from multiple instances of `cloudflared`, giving you the ability to run many `cloudflared` replicas to scale your system when incoming traffic changes.

In this tutorial, we will walk through running an application as a Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), and then running `cloudflared` in a separate [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

This architecture allows `cloudflared` instances to proxy Internet traffic into whichever Kubernetes Service it was configured to.

**üó∫Ô∏è This tutorial covers how to:**

* Deploy `cloudflared` in a replica model
* Proxy traffic into a Kubernetes service with Tunnel

**‚è≤Ô∏è Time to complete: 45 minutes**

## Install `cloudflared`

Start by [downloading and installing](/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation) the lightweight Cloudflare Tunnel daemon, `cloudflared`. Reference our installation guide for instructions on how to install `cloudflared` on your operating system.

## Login to Cloudflare

Once installed, you can use the `tunnel login` command in `cloudflared` to obtain a certificate.

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel login
```

## Create your Tunnel

In the example below, simply change `<example-tunnel>` to the name you wish to assign to your Tunnel.

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel create example-tunnel
Tunnel credentials written to /Users/cf000197/.cloudflared/ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.json. cloudflared chose this file based on where your origin certificate was found. Keep this file secret. To revoke these credentials, delete the tunnel.

Created tunnel example-tunnel with id ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad
```

## Upload the Tunnel credentials file to Kubernetes

Next, you will upload the generated Tunnel credential file as a secret to your Kubernetes cluster. You will also need to provide the filepath that the Tunnel credentials file was created under. You can find that path in the output of `cloudflared tunnel create <example-tunnel>` above.

```sh
$ kubectl create secret generic tunnel-credentials \
--from-file=credentials.json=/Users/cf000197/.cloudflared/ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.json
```

## Associate your Tunnel with a DNS record

1. Go to the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Navigate to the [DNS tab](https://dash.cloudflare.com/dns).
3. Now create a CNAME targeting `.cfargotunnel.com`. In this example, the tunnel ID is ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad, so create a CNAME record specifically targeting `ef824aef-7557-4b41-a398-4684585177ad.cfargotunnel.com`.

You can also create multiple CNAME records targeting the same Tunnel, if desired.

Alternatively, you can perform this step from the command line by running `cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel> <hostname>`. For example, `cloudflared tunnel route dns example-tunnel tunnel.example.com`. You can use a similar method to route traffic to `cloudflared` from a [Cloudflare Load Balancer](https://www.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/), see [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb) for details.

## Deploy `cloudflared`

Now, we'll deploy `cloudflared` by applying its [manifest](https://github.com/cloudflare/argo-tunnel-examples/blob/master/named-tunnel-k8s/cloudflared.yaml). This will start a [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) for running `cloudflared` and a [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) with `cloudflared`'s config. When Cloudflare receives traffic for the DNS or Load Balancing hostname you configured in the previous step, it will send that traffic to the `cloudflared` instances running in this deployment. Then, those `cloudflared` instances will proxy the request to your [application's Service](https://github.com/cloudflare/argo-tunnel-examples/blob/master/named-tunnel-k8s/app.yaml).

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f cloudflared.yaml
deployment.apps/cloudflared created
configmap/cloudflared configured
```

## Examine status of your pod

```
    $ kubectl get pods

In this tutorial, we've covered how the same Tunnel can be run in many `cloudflared` processes. You can also use this knowledge to support elastic scaling, graceful `cloudflared` restarts, and rolling upgrades in the future.
