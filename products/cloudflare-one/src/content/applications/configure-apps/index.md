# Add applications

With Cloudflare for Teams, you can protect two types of applications: SaaS and self-hosted.

**SaaS applications** include applications your team relies on that are not hosted by your organization, such as Slack or Airtable.

**Self-hosted applications** include your internal tools and applications, such as Jira or Grafana. You must secure self-hosted applications with Cloudflare's authoritative DNS to use Cloudflare Access.
