# Build configuration

## Build commands and directories

You should provide a build command to tell Cloudflare Pages how to build your application. For projects not listed here, consider reading the tool's documentation or framework, and submit a pull request to add it here!

Build directories indicates where your project's build command outputs the built version of your Cloudflare Pages site. Often, this defaults to the industry-standard `public`, but you may find that you need to customize it.

Below are some standard build commands and directories for popular frameworks and tools.

## Environment variables

If your project make use of environment variables to build your site, you can provide custom environment variables via the Pages UI.

Many common tools have been pre-installed as well:

| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Boot        |                                 |
| Cask        |                                 |

| Leiningen   |                                 |

| Zola        |                                 |

If you need to use a specific version of a language, e.g. Node.js or Ruby, you can specify it by providing an associated environment variable in your build configuration, or setting the relevant file in your source code. Below are some examples:

| Language/tool | Environment variable | File                      |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Go            | `GO_VERSION`         |                           |
| Node.js       | `NODE_VERSION`       | `.nvmrc`, `.node-version` |
| NPM           | `NPM_VERSION`        |                           |
| Python        | `PYTHON_VERSION`     | `runtime.txt`, `Pipfile`  |
| Ruby          | `RUBY_VERSION`       | `.ruby-version`           |
| Yarn          | `YARN_VERSION`       |                           |

If you're looking to set a specific version of a framework your Cloudflare Pages project is using, note that Pages will respect your package manager of choice during your build process. For instance, if you use Gatsby.js, your `package.json` should indicate a version of the `gatsby` NPM package, which will be installed using `npm install` as your project builds on Cloudflare Pages.
