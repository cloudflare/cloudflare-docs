# Known issues

Here are some known bugs and issues that we're aware of with Cloudflare Pages:
- Source code hosting tools besides GitHub—for instance, BitBucket or Gitlab—are not currently supported.
- Pages currently only supports a single project per repository. Monorepos or repositories with multiple codebases/applications currently can't deploy more than one project to Pages at a time.
- Once you've selected a GitHub repository for your Pages application, it can't be changed. Please remove/delete your Pages project and create a new one pointing at a different repository if you need to update it.
- pages.dev subdomains currently can't be changed. If you need to change your pages.dev subdomain, delete your project and create a new one.
- Hugo builds automatically run an old version. To run the latest version of Hugo (for instance, 0.80.0), you'll need to set an environment variable. Set `HUGO_VERSION` to `0.80.0` or the Hugo version of your choice.
- By default, we use Node 10 in the Pages build environment. If you need to use a newer Node version, see our [Build configuration page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration) for configuration options.
