# Deploy a Gatsby site

Gatsby is an open-source React framework for creating websites and apps. In this guide, you will create a new Gatsby application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will be using the `gatsby` CLI to create a new Gatsby site.

## Installing Gatsby

Install the `gatsby` CLI by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

## Creating a new project

With Gatsby installed, you can create a new project using `gatsby new`. The `new` command accepts a GitHub URL for using an existing template. As an example, use the `gatsby-starter-lumen` template by running the following command in your terminal. You can find more in [Gatsby's Starters section](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?v=2):

```sh
$ gatsby new my-gatsby-site https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen
```

## Creating a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourgithubusername/githubrepo
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main
```

## Deploying with Cloudflare Pages

Deploy your site to Pages by logging into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) > **Account Home** > **Pages** and selecting **Create a project**. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

<TableLayout>

| Configuration option | Value          |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Production branch    | `main`         |
| Build command        | `gatsby build` |
| Build directory      | `public`       |

</TableLayout>

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `gatsby`, your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

<Aside type="note">

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/get-started).

</Aside>

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`. 
Every time you commit new code to your Gatsby site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/platform/preview-deployments) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

By completing this guide, you have successfully deployed your Gatsby site to Cloudflare Pages. To get started with other frameworks, [refer to the list of Framework guides](/framework-guides).
