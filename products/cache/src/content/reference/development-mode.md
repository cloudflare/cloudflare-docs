# Development Mode

Development Mode temporarily suspends Cloudflare's edge caching, [minification](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168196), [Polish](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/polish), and [Railgun](https://developers.cloudflare.com/railgun/) features for three hours unless disabled beforehand. Development Mode allows customers to immediately observe changes to their cacheable content like images, CSS, or JavaScript.  

## Enable Development Mode

Development Mode temporarily bypasses Cloudflare’s cache and does not purge cached files. To purge your Cloudflare cache, refer to [purge cache](/how-to/purge-cache).

1. Log in to your Cloudflare account.
1. Select your domain.
1. Click **Caching**.
1. Toggle **Development Mode** to **On**.
