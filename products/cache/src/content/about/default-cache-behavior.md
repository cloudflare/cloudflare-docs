# Default Cache Behavior

Cloudflare respects the origin web server’s cache headers in the following order unless an Edge Cache TTL page rule overrides the headers. 

- Cloudflare does not cache the resource if the `Cache-Control` header is set to `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`, or `max-age=0` or if there is a cookie in the response.
- Cloudflare caches the resource in the following scenarios:
    - The `Cache-Control` header is set to `public` and the `max-age` is greater than 0.
    - The `Expires` header is set to a future date.
- If both the `max-age` and an `Expires` header are set, `max-age` is used.

For a list of directives and behaviors when Origin Cache-Control is enabled or disabled, see [Cache-Control directives](/about/cache-control#cache-control-directives).

## Default cached file extensions

Cloudflare only caches based on file extension and not by MIME type. The Cloudflare CDN does not cache HTML by default. Additionally, Cloudflare caches a website’s robot.txt.

To cache additional content, see [Page Rules]()/how-to/create-page-rules) to create a rule to cache everything.

## Customization options and limitations

Cloudflare’s CDN provides several cache customization options:
- Caching behavior for individual URLs via [Cloudflare Page Rules](/how-to/create-page-rules)
- Customize caching with [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-the-cache-works)
- Adjust caching level, cache TTL, and more via the Cloudflare Caching app

Cloudflare limits the upload size (HTTP POST request size) per plan type:

- 100MB Free and Pro
- 200MB Business
- 500MB Enterprise by default. Contact [Customer Support](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172476) to request a limit increase.

If you require a larger upload, group requests smaller than the upload thresholds or upload the full resource through an [unproxied (grey-clouded) DNS record](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169626).

## Cloudflare cache responses

The output of the `CF-Cache-Status header` shows whether or not a resource is cached. To investigate cache responses returned by the `CF-Cache-Status` header, use services like [Redbot](https://redbot.org/), [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/), or a visual tool like [Chrome’s Dr. Flare plugin](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/community-tip-dr-flare-debug-tool-for-cloudflare-chrome-extension/110166).
