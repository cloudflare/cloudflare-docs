# Add a third-party tool

You can add new third-party tools and load them into your website through the Cloudflare dashboard. If your tool needs more than a simple `Pageview` event to trigger it, [create the trigger](/get-started/create-trigger) you need first.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and website.

1. Click **Zaraz**.

1. From **Third-party tools**, click **Add new tool**.

1. Choose a tool from the tools library page and click **Continue** to confirm your selection.

1. In **Set up**, configure the settings for your new tool. The information you need to enter will depend on the tool you choose. 

1. Optional: Click **Add field** to add additional fields to your tool. Refer to [Custom fields](/get-started/custom-fields) for more information.

1. Click **Save**.

Your tool is now configured. Depending on the tool you chose, Cloudflare Zaraz might automatically create a `Pageview` event. Refer to [Send events to a third-party tool](/get-started/send-events) to learn more.

On this page you can configure the tool's **Settings**, add additional events by clicking **Create event**, and click the events listed to edit them.
