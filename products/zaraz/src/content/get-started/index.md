# Get started

To enable Cloudflare Zaraz, you need to add a third-party tool to your dashboard. You also need to create the Event that will activate the loading of the tool in your website, and the trigger, or set of conditions, to determine if and when Zaraz should send events to third-party tools. 

If your tool just needs a `page view` event as a trigger, go to [Add a third-party tool](/get-started/add-tool) to get started. If you need a different kind of trigger, or set of triggers, go to [Create a trigger](/get-started/create-trigger) first.
