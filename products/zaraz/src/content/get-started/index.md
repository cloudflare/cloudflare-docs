# Get started

Before being able to use Zaraz, your website has to be proxied through Cloudflare. Refer to [Creating a Cloudflare account and adding a website](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/201720164) for more information.

If your website is already proxied through Cloudflare, log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/zaraz) and add the third-party tool or service you need to Zaraz.

Zaraz relies on Events and triggers to automatically load and activate the tool you chose into your website. The way you configure your setup will depend on the tool you need for your website. For example, if the tool you chose just needs a `Pageview` event as a trigger, go to [Add a third-party tool](/get-started/add-tool) to get started. If you need a different kind of trigger or set of triggers, go to [Create a trigger](/get-started/create-trigger) first.

All configurations and triggers are accessible from the dashboard. If you need more complex integrations, Cloudflare Zaraz provides a unified set of functions to send data programmatically to third-party tools. Regardless of the tool you need to use, `zaraz.track()` will send your data wherever you choose, without even needing to load the toolâ€™s script.
