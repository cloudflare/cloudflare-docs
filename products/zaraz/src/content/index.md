# Cloudflare Zaraz

Cloudflare Zaraz gives you complete control over third-party tools and services, and allows you to offload them to Cloudflare's edge, improving the speed and security of your website. With Cloudflare Zaraz, you can load tools such as analytics tools, advertising pixels and scripts, chatbots, marketing automation tools and more, in the most optimized way.

Zaraz is built for speed, privacy, and security, and you can use it to load as many tools as you need, with a near-zero performance hit.

To start using Cloudflare Zaraz, you just need to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and add a third-party tool or service to it. All configurations and triggers are accessible from the dashboard. If you need more complex integrations, Cloudflare Zaraz provides a unified set of functions to send data programmatically to third-party tools. Regardless of the tool you need to use, `zaraz.track()` will send your data wherever you choose, without even loading the toolâ€™s script."
