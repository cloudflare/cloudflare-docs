# Review the infrastructure

After [enabling Security Insights](/get-started) and letting the first scan run, the **Infrastructure** tab displays an overview of the infrastructure associated with your Cloudflare account.

To open the **Infrastructure** tab, go to **Account Home** > **Security Center** > **Infrastructure**.

You can perform the following actions:

* Filter the displayed information
* Print or download a PDF report

## Export inventory

In the same tab, the **Inventory** card displays a list of domains and their current security-related status. To export the displayed inventory items (according to your current filters), click **Export**.
