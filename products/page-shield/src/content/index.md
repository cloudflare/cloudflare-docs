* **Malicious code detection**: Detects malicious code in your pages using threat intelligence and machine learning.
* **Code change detection**: Detects any changes in the scripts loaded in your pages.
* **Alerts**: Receive notifications about newly detected scripts, scripts loaded from unknown domains, new scripts considered malicious, or code changes in your existing scripts.
