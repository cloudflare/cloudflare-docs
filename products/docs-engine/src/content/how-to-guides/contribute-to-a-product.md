# Contribute to a product

<Aside>

__Note for Cloudflare employees:__ The details of this process are still being worked out. For the time being, please do not migrate any Cloudflare products without first checking in with Adam ([afs@cloudflare.com](mailto:afs@cloudflare.com), [@adamschwartz on Github](https://github.com/adamschwartz)). Thanks for your patience.

</Aside>

This document is intended to help __Cloudflare employees__ contribute to products that have already been migrated to the new Docs Engine.

A product has been migrated if it is listed in the [migration table](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs#migration-progress) and its `Prod` column contains a link to a production site at `developers.cloudflare.com/$productName`.

--------------------------------

## Two ways to contibute

1. For small changes, simply find the `.md` file you want to modify inside the product’s `src/content/` directory. The `Edit on Github` link in the footer of every deployed page will automatically link you there.

2. For larger changes, or changes made to multiple files at once, you’ll want to set up a local development environment, which you can do by [following these steps](/how-to-guides/migrate-a-product#step-2-set-up-local-development).

--------------------------------

## Stay tuned...

These docs are in active development.
