# Contribute to Cloudflare’s docs

This guide is for contributors to [@cloudflare/cloudflare-docs](http://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs).

--------------------------------

## Two ways to contibute

### 1. GitHub website

Live docs pages feature a __Edit on GitHub__ link in the footer. Clicking this link will automatically take you to that page’s associated `.md` file in the repo.

From there you, make sure you’re signed into GitHub. Once signed in, you’ll be able to click the pencil icon in the top right corner of the file to start editing the document right from within the browser.

GitHub will then guide you through making a commit and ultimately a pull request with your proposed change.

### 2. Local development

<Aside header="Note for Cloudflare employees">

Contact the __Developer Docs__ room if you’d like to be given write access to [@cloudflare/cloudflare-docs](http://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs). Otherwise you can fork the repo on GitHub.

</Aside>

For changes you’d like to test locally before committing them, or changes made to multiple files at once, you’ll want to [set up a local development environment](/contributing/development-setup).
