# Writing accessible content

- **Use descriptive link text.** Don’t say “Learn more [here](https://example.com).” Instead say “[Learn more about examples at example.com](https://example.com).”

- **Use descriptive alt text and file names for images.** Don’t write `![screenshot](image.png)`. Instead write `![Workers dashboard screenshot](workers-dashboard-screenshot.png)`.

- **Use an `sh` code block over a screenshot of a terminal output.** This also helps ensure a consistent display.
