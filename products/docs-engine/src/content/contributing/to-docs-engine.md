## Background

The Cloudflare Docs Engine is based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), and enables developers to quickly build out docs sites by allowing them to focus on the Markdown content.

Authors can leverage the power of MDX by building custom components or utilize the powerful [built-in components](/reference/markdown).
