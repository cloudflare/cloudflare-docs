## PagerDuty

1. In the **Connected notification services** card, click **Connect**.
1. Log in to your PagerDuty account to connect it to your Cloudflare account.
1. Select the services you want to use and click **Connect**.
1. The browser will navigate back to your Cloudflare dashboard. Click **Continue**.

Your new connected PagerDuty will appear in the **Connected notification services** card.

## Webhooks to external services

There are a variety of services you can connect to Cloudflare using webhooks to receive Notifications from your Cloudflare account. Here are some of the most popular services you can connect to your Cloudflare account:

* [Jira](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) 
* [Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
* [Google Chat](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks)
* [DataDog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/guide/calling-on-datadog-s-api-with-the-webhooks-integration/)
* [OpsGenie](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/integration-api)

After configuring the external service you want to connect to, set up webhooks in your Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account / domain.
1. Go to **Notifications**. 
1. Click **Destinations** on the left side of your dashboard.
1. In the **Webhooks** card, click **Create**.
1. Give your webhook a name so you can identify it later.
1. In the **URL** field, enter the URL of the third-party service you set up above and want to connect to your Cloudflare account.
1. If needed, insert the **Secret**. Secrets are how webhooks are encrypted and vary according to the service you are connecting to Cloudflare.
