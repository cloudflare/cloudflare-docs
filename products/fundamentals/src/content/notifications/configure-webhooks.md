1. Click **Destinations** on the left side of your dashboard.
1. In the **Webhooks** card, click **Create**.
1. Give your webhook a name so you can identify it later.
1. In the **URL** field, enter the URL of the third-party service you previously set up and want to connect to your Cloudflare account.
