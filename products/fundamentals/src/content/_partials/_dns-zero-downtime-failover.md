If your Cloudflare **DNS** provides another *A* or *AAAA* record or your Cloudflare **Load Balancer* lists another origin in the same pool, **Zero-Downtime Failover** automatically retries requests to your origin even before a Load Balancing decision is made.  Cloudflare currently retries only once for HTTP [521](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003011431#521error), [522](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003011431#522error), and [523](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003011431#523error) response codes. **Zero-Downtime Failover** is available on our Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans.
