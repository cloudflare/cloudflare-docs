# Adding rules

You can check for an existing root ruleset from the dashboard or via the [Account rulesets API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#account-rulesets-properties). If you're a new Magic Transit customer, you may not have a root ruleset created for your account.

To view examples for root rulesets, review the the [Magic Firewall Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/magic_firewall_ruleset).

## Step 1: Check for an existing root ruleset

1. From your dashboard, click **Firewall Rulesets**. **Magic Firewall Rules** displays.
1. Click **Browse Rulesets**.

If you have an existing ruleset, it displays in the **Custom Rulesets** table.

## Step 2: Add a ruleset with an existing rule

Create a new ruleset from the Custom Rulesets section.

1. From your dashboard, click **Firewall Rulesets**. **Magic Firewall Rules** displays.
1. Click **Browse Rulesets**.
1. Click **Create new ruleset**. 
1. Complete the **Add rule** and **Manage rules** process steps.
