* _[Configuration data](/magic-transit/how-to/set-up/configuration-data/)_ defines customer configuration data required for Cloudflare to set up Magic Transit for your organization.
* _[Additional guidelines](/magic-transit/how-to/set-up/additional-guidelines/)_ provides guidance for maximum segment size and maximum transmission unit, the impact of routing changes, and support for route prefixes smaller than /24.
