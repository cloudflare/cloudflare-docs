If the location you are sending requests from is only using IPv6 or sending all DNS requests using DNS over HTTPS, click **Delete** on the right side of the IP address field, as the field is not required.

4. Click on **Add location**.

5. Your location will now appear in the **Locations** tab, along with the others you have setup.
