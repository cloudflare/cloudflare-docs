# Android Setup Instructions (Manual)

<Aside>

Note that if you were using 1.1.1.1 for Families in the mobile app, you will at first need to disable 1.1.1.1 for Families. You can disable it by going to `Advanced -> Connection options -> DNS Settings -> 1.1.1.1 for Families -> And select 'None'`.
</Aside>

## Install the 1.1.1.1 mobile app
Install the 1.1.1.1 mobile app by visiting the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone) on your Android device. 

If you already have the app on your phone, make sure you have the latest version of the app and then skip to the next step.

## Click on the menu button
After you open the 1.1.1.1 mobile app, visit settings.

## Click on Advanced

## Enter unique id from Gateway
When you are on this screen on your phone, you will need to enter the unique subdomain of the location you created for your mobile phone. 

1. Visit your teams dashboard to fetch the unique id from your location.
