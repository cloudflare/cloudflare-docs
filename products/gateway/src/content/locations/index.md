# Locations

Locations are usually physical entities like offices, homes, retail stores, movie theatres or a data centers. The fastest way to start sending DNS queries from a location and protect it from security threats is by changing the DNS resolvers at the router to the dedicated IPv6 addresses for those locations.

If you donâ€™t have IPv6 network, you can set up a location by adding the source IP for the location and changing the DNS resolvers to

* **172.64.36.1**
* **172.64.36.2**

If you want to send your DNS queries over an encrypted connection, you can use the hostname that we provide in the dashboard to send queries using DNS over HTTPS.
