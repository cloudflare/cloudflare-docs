# Free Program

We know that organizations and individuals around the world depend on Cloudflare and our network.

We recognize that this emergency has put a strain on the infrastructure of companies around the world as more employees work from home. Cloudflare has made our Cloudflare for Teams platform, which helps support secure and efficient remote work, free through September 1. This offer includes Cloudflare Access, Argo Tunnel, and Cloudflare Gateway.

If you are already a Cloudflare for Teams customer, we have removed the caps on usage during this emergency so you can scale to whatever number of seats you need without additional cost through September 1, 2020. If you are not yet using Cloudflare for Teams, and if you or your employer are struggling with limits on the capacity of your existing VPN or Firewall, we stand ready to help and have removed the limits on the free trials of our Access and Gateway products through September 1, 2020. Cloudflare employees around the world have volunteered to run onboarding sessions so you can get setup quickly and can ensure your businessâ€™ continuity.

### Program details
The program includes the following features:
* Up to 3 locations 
* Unlimited security and content filters 
* The ability to assign multiple policies to one location 
* The ability to update IPs for locations

As September 2nd draws closer, users will be prompted to select a paid plan. Pricing for these plans can be found [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams-pricing/). Teams that exceed the limit of the Teams Free plan will not be immediately downgraded; however, they will not be able to expand protection to additional users or locations from their current deployment.
