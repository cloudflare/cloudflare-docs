## Why add a domain to the Allow list
Sometimes you may want to allow a domain when that domain belongs to a category you are blocking.

For example: if you are blocking the category `Sports` and want to allow the domain `arsenal.com` (which belongs to the category), add the domain to the list of allowed domains.

## Steps
You can allow a domain by:

1. Going to ‘Policies’

2. Clicking on ‘Allow/Block’

3. Enter the domain you want to allow in the ‘Add a domain’ field

4. From the Allow/Block dropdown, select 'Allow’

5. Click on the ‘Add domain’ button
