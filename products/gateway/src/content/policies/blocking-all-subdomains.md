# Blocking All Subdomains

When you manually block a domain, you automatically block all of its subdomains. For example, if you are blocking `example.com`, our policy engine will also block a.example.com, a.b.example.com. 

If you only want to block a subdomain `a.example.com`, then instead of adding `example.com` to the list, you will add `a.example.com`. Note that once you add `a.example.com` to the block list, Cloudflare Gateway will also block all subdomains of `a.example.com`.
