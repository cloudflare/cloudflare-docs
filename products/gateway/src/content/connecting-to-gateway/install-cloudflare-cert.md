# Install the Cloudflare root certificate

Advanced security features including HTTPS traffic inspection require users to install and trust the Cloudflare root certificate on their machine or device. If you are installing certificates manually on all of your devices, these steps will need to be performed on each new device that is to be subject to HTTP Filtering.

## Download the Cloudflare root certificate
First, download the Cloudflare certificate [from this location](../static/Cloudflare_CA.crt).

### Verify the certificate fingerprint

To verify your download, check that the certificate's thumbprint matches:

#### SHA1
```txt
BB:2D:B6:3D:6B:DE:DA:06:4E:CA:CB:40:F6:F2:61:40:B7:10:F0:6C
```

#### SHA256
```txt
F5:E1:56:C4:89:78:77:AD:79:3A:1E:83:FA:77:83:F1:9C:B0:C6:1B:58:2C:2F:50:11:B3:37:72:7C:62:3D:EF
```

## Add the certificate to your system

### MacOS

#### Before you start
You will need to install the root certificate in the Keychain Access application. In the application, you can choose the keychain in which you want to install the certificate. macOS offers three options, each having a different impact on which users will be affected by trusting the root certificate.

| Keychain   | Impact                  |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| login       | The logged in user      |
| Local Items | Cached iCloud passwords |
| System      | All users on the system |

Installing the certificate in the Login keychain will result in only the logged in user trusting the Cloudflare certificate. Installing it in the System keychain affects all users who have access to that machine. 

To install the certificate in Keychain Access:

1. Download the Cloudflare certificate [here](../static/Cloudflare_CA.crt).

2. Double-click on the `.crt` file.

  The certificate is now listed in the **Keychain Access** application, under the **login** keychain. If you want to install it in the **System** keychain instead, drag and drop the certificate from the login keychain onto the System keychain section on the left.

4. Click **Trust**.

 The certificate is now installed. However, before it can be used, it must be trusted by the device. 

7. On the device, go to **Settings** > **General** > **About** > **Certificate Trust Settings**.

 The installed root certificates will be displayed in the *Enable full trust for root certificates* section.
