# Connect to the L7 Firewall

<Aside type='warning' header='⚠️ THIS PAGE IS OUTDATED'>

</Aside>

In the future, Cloudflare Gateway will support the ability for organizations to connect to the L7 firewall directly, without the use of the Cloudflare for Teams client, through the deployment of a PAC file. Today, organizations must connect to Cloudflare Gateway with the Teams client and the user must be enrolled in a Gateway organization with a paid subscription in order to receive protections from HTTP traffic filtering.
