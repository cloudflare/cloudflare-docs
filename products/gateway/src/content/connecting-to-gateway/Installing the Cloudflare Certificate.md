# Install the Cloudflare Root Certificate

Advanced security features including HTTPS traffic inspection require users to install and trust the Cloudflare root certificate on their machine or device. If you are installing certificates manually on all of your devices, these steps will need to be performed on each new device that is to be subject to HTTP Filtering.

## Download the Cloudflare root certificate
The Cloudflare certificate can be downloaded [from this location](../static/Cloudflare_CA.crt)

### Verify the certificate fingerprint

To verify your download, check that the certificates thumbprint matches:

#### SHA1
`BB:2D:B6:3D:6B:DE:DA:06:4E:CA:CB:40:F6:F2:61:40:B7:10:F0:6C`

#### SHA256
`F5:E1:56:C4:89:78:77:AD:79:3A:1E:83:FA:77:83:F1:9C:B0:C6:1B:58:2C:2F:50:11:B3:37:72:7C:62:3D:EF`

## Add certificate to your system

### MacOS

#### Before starting
Installing a certificate in Keychain in macOS requires consideration of which users to affect. macOS offers three options to install the certificate in Keychain with each having a different impact on which users are impacted by trusting the root certificate.

| Key Chain   | Impact                  |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Login       | The logged on user      |
| Local Items | Cached iCloud passwords |
| System      | All users on the system |

Installing the certificate in Login will result in only the logged in user trusting the Cloudflare certificate. Installing in System affects all users who use that machine. 

1. Download the Cloudflare certificate [at this location](../static/Cloudflare_CA.crt)
