# Cloudflare bot solutions

Cloudflare bot solutions identify and mitigate automated traffic to protect your domain from bad bots.

As humans have become more reliant on the Internet, [bots](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/) have become a force for good and bad. Some bots help us complete monotonous tasks at scale — for example, populating search engines by scraping the web for content. Without these bots, we would have no way to build many important tools and services. Unfortunately, other bots are positioned for abuse. These bots hoard inventory on ecommerce domains, break into user accounts with credential stuffing, and raise origin costs on your domain. Large companies should always have a bot solution in place, and smaller companies and individuals should protect their domains as a best practice.

Roughly 40% of Internet traffic is now automated, and [trends](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bot-attack-trends-for-jan-jul-2020/) continue to show more diverse and sophisticated attacks. With Cloudflare’s suite of bot solutions, you can protect your domains and view detailed analytics for your domain's traffic.

While Cloudflare offers several products that mitigate and identify bot traffic, this section reviews our _bot-specific products_, Bot Fight Mode, Super Bot Fight Mode, and Bot Management for Enterprise.

## What is a bot?

A bot is a software application programmed to do certain tasks. For a more thorough definition and real-world examples of bots, see our [Learning Center](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/).

## Which bot solution do I need?

If you have a smaller domain and have identified a bot problem, we recommend Bot Fight Mode or Super Bot Fight Mode (included with your plan subscription). You can enable either from your dashboard, but these solutions offer limited configuration options.

If you have a large, sophisticated domain with a lot of traffic, we recommend Bot Management for Enterprise, especially for customers in ecommerce, banking, and security. To enable Bot Management for Enterprise and write rules to customize your bot protection, contact your account team.
