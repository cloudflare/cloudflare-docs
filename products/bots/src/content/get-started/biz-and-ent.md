# Get started with Super Bot Fight Mode (Business)

Super Bot Fight Mode is included in your Business or Enterprise subscription. When enabled, the product:

- Identifies traffic matching patterns of known bots and likely bots
- Can challenge or block bots
- Offers protection for static resources
- Provides robust analytics to help you understand bot traffic

<Aside>

**Note**: If you have an Enterprise subscription without Bot Management, your application will also have Super Bot Fight Mode for Business.
