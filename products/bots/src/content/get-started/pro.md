## Analytics

### Bot Report

Use the **Bot Report** to monitor bot traffic for the past 24 hours.

To access the **Bot Report**, go to **Firewall** > **Bots**. If you see a double-digit percentage of automated traffic, you may want to upgrade to [Bot Management](/about/plans/bm-subscription) to save money on origin costs and protect your site from large-scale attacks.
