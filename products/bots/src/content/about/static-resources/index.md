# Protect static resources from bots

Pro, Business, and Enterprise customers can use Cloudflare's bot solutions to protect their static resources from bots.

<Aside type="warning" header="Warning">
If you enable static resource protection, you may block good bots — like mail clients — that routinely fetch static resources. Make sure you understand your existing infrastructure before enabling this feature.
</Aside>

## Super Bot Fight Mode

To enable this feature as a Pro or Business customer or an Enterprise customer without Bot Management:
1. Go to **Firewall** > **Bots**.
1. Select **Configure Super Bot Fight Mode**.
1. For **Static resource protection**, select **On**.
