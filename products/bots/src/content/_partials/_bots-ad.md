The **Anomaly Detection (AD)** engine is an optional detection engine that uses a form of unsupervised learning. We record a baseline of your siteâ€™s traffic and use the baseline to intelligently detect outlier requests. This approach is user agent-agnostic and can be turned on or off by your account team. 

Cloudflare does not recommend AD for sites that use SSL for SaaS or expect large amounts of API traffic. The AD engine immediately gives automated requests a score of one.
