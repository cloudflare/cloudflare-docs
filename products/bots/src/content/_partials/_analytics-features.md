Bot Analytics shows up to one week of data at a time and can display data up to 30 days old. Cloudflare uses adaptive bitrate technology to show sampled data — most customers will see a 1-10% sample depending on how much information they are trying to view. Tooltips on the page will display the current sample rate.

Bot Analytics displays data in real time in most cases.
