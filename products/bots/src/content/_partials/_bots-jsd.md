Lastly, the **JavaScript Detections (JSD)** engine is an optional engine that identifies headless browsers and other malicious fingerprints. This engine conducts a lightweight, invisible JavaScript injection on the client side of any request while honoring our [strict privacy standards](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/). We do not collect any personally-identifiable information during the process. The JSD engine either blocks, challenges, or passes requests to other engines. JSD is enabled by default but completely optional. To adjust your settings, open the Bot Management Configuration page from **Firewall** > **Tools**.
