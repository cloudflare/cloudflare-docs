Bot Fight Mode and Super Bot Fight Mode use the same underlying technology that powers our [Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/) product. Specifically, these products:

- Protect entire domains without endpoint restrictions
- Cannot be customized, adjusted, or reconfigured via Firewall Rules

Although these products are designed to fight malicious actors on the Internet, they may challenge API or mobile app traffic. For more granular control, upgrade to [Bot Management for Enterprise](../bm-subscription).
