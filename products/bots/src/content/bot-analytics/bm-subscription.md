## Features

For a full tour of Bot Analytics, see [our blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-bot-analytics/). At a high level, the tool includes:

- **Requests by bot score**: View your total domain traffic and segment it vertically by traffic type. Keep an eye on *automated* and *likely automated* traffic.
- **Bot score distribution**: View the number of requests assigned a bot score 1 through 99.
- **Bot score source**: Identify the most common detection engines used to score your traffic. Hover over a tooltip to learn more about each engine.
- **Top requests by attribute**: View more detailed information on specific IP addresses and other characteristics.

Bot Analytics shows up to one week of data at a time and can display data up to 30 days old. Bot Analytics displays data in real time in most cases.

## API

Data from Bot Analytics is also available via the GraphQL API. You can access bot scores, bot sources, [Bot Tags](../../about/cloudflare-bot-tags), and bot *decisions* (*automated*, *likely automated*, etc.).

Read the [GraphQL Analytics API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api) for more information about GraphQL and basic querying.
