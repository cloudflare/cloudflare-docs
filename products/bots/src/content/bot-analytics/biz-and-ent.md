# Super Bot Fight Mode (Business) Analytics

Business and Enterprise customers without Bot Management can use **Bot Analytics** to dynamically examine bot traffic. These dashboards offer less functionality than Bot Management for Enterprise but still help you understand bot traffic on your domain.

## Access

To use Bot Analytics, open the Cloudflare dashboard and select **Firewall** > **Bots**.

## Features

For a full tour of Bot Analytics, see [our blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-bot-analytics/). At a high level, the tool includes:

- **Requests by traffic type**: View your total domain traffic segmented vertically by traffic type. Keep an eye on *automated* and *likely automated* traffic.
- **Requests by detection source**: Identify the most common detection engines used to score your traffic. Hover over a tooltip to learn more about each engine.
- **Top requests by attribute**: View more detailed information on specific IP addresses and other characteristics.

Bot Analytics shows up to 72 hours of data at a time and can display data up to 30 days old. Bot Analytics displays data in real time in most cases.
