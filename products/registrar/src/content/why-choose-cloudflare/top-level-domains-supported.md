# Top Level Domains supported

In the [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/domain-name-system-dns/) hierarchy, a top-level domain (TLD) represents the first stop after the root zone. In simpler terms, a TLD is everything that follows the final dot of a [domain name](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/). For example, in the domain name `google.com`, `.com` is the TLD. Some other popular TLDs include `.org`, `.uk`, and `.edu`.

Cloudflare supports over 200 top-level domains (TLDs). The full list of supported TLDs [can be found on our TLD policies page](https://www.cloudflare.com/tld-policies/).

Cloudflare cannot list the wholesale cost for most TLDs in our marketing materials due to commitments in our contracts with the registries. Cloudflare can, however, give you the wholesale cost at checkout when you transfer your domain.
