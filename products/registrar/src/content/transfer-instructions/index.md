# Transfer instructions

Transferring a domain to a new registrar informs the registry that they should instead trust that new registrar to modify information. The process requires some steps at both your new registrar and the one you are leaving. Each registrar handles transfers a bit differently, but in general they follow a pattern based on rules set by ICANN, the organization responsible for regulating domain registration.

This section contains transfer instructions for some of the largest registrars as well as generic details.

Before following the transfer steps for a particular registrar to transfer a domain to Cloudflare, the domain must already be set up to use Cloudflare. This can be done by clicking the Add a Site button on the main page of your Cloudflare account and changing your DNS servers to Cloudflare's in your original registrar domain management.
