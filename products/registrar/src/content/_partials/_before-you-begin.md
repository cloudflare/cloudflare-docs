Before transferring a domain to or from Cloudflare:
- Disable DNSSEC by:
    - Removing the DS record at your current DNS host.
    - [Disabling DNSSEC](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360006660072) in the Cloudflare dashboard.
- If initiating multiple transfers, notify your financial institution to prevent them from flagging these charges as fraudulent.
- Renew your domain if it's within 15 days of expiration.
