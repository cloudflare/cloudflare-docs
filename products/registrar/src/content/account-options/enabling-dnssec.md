# Domain Name System Security Extensions

The domain name system (DNS) translates domain names into numeric Internet addresses. However, DNS is a fundamentally insecure protocol. It does not guarantee where DNS records come from and accepts any requests given to it.

DNSSEC creates a secure layer to the domain name system by adding cryptographic signatures to DNS records. By doing so, your request can check the signature to verify that the record you need comes from the authoritative name server and was not altered along the way.

## Enabling DNSSEC

Cloudflare Registrar offers one-click DNSSEC activation for free to all customers. You will not need to set the DS record details manually. However, your domain must be using Cloudflare as the authoritative DNS provider.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select the account and domain you want to configure.
1. Navigate to **DNS**.
1. Scroll down until you reach **DNSSEC**. Select **Enable DNSSEC**.
1. You will be presented with DS record details specific to your site. You do not need to copy these or manually enter them when you are using Cloudflare Registrar. Instead, select **Confirm**.

Cloudflare will publish those DS details in the form of CDS and CDNSKEY records for a domain delegated to Cloudflare. The Cloudflare Registrar scans those records at regular intervals. When Cloudflare notices you have enabled DNSSEC, Cloudflare gathers those details and sends them to your domainâ€™s registry.

This process can take one to two days after you first enable DNSSEC.

## Confirming DNSSEC

When DNSSEC has been successfully applied to your domain, you will see a confirmed status in the DNSSEC card where you first selected **Enable**. You can also confirm this by reviewing the WHOIS information for your domain. Domains with DNSSEC will read `signedDelegation` in the DNSSEC field.
