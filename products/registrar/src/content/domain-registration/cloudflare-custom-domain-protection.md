# Cloudflare custom domain protection

Cloudflare offers [Custom Domain Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/custom-domain-protection/) to customers with high-profile domains who need the highest level of security against domain hijacking.

--------

## Custom domain protection features
Custom Domain Protection offers additional safeguard features for registered domains, including:

### Registry lock
Cloudflare applies Registry Lock, when available, to all domains registered through Custom Domain Protection. Any changes to a domain requires Cloudflare to first unlock the domain at the registry level.

### Out-of-band authentication
All changes to domain ownership or nameserver information are verified and executed manually based on an authentication process defined by the customer.

### No interface
Custom Domain Protection does not offer an interface to remove the possibility of domain hijack through a compromised account.

Custom Domain Protection is only available to customers with a Cloudflare Enterprise plan.
