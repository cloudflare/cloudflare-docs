# Rules

You can check for an existing root ruleset from the dashboard or via the [Account rulesets API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#account-rulesets-properties). If you are a new Magic Transit customer, you may not have a root ruleset created for your account.

To view examples for root rulesets, review the the [Magic Firewall Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/magic_firewall_ruleset).
