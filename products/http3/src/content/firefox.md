# Mozilla Firefox

Firefox has begun supporting HTTP/3 in nightly builds. Firefox nightly is an official experimental channel that provides binaries to allow you to test new features such as HTTP/3. **Nightly builds may have some stability issues that you should keep in mind when testing**.

HTTP/3 is not enabled by default. It can be enabled by toggling network.http.http3.enabled value to true in about:config,

## Installation

Only Firefox nightly builds currently support HTTP/3. To install the latest, [download](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) the installer and run it.

Launch browser advanced preferences by entering about:config in the URL section. Search the preference network.http.http3.enabled and make it to true.
