# Administration

Browser Isolation can be tested in two ways:

1. **Self managed**: Test isolated browsing with admin controls using your own Cloudflare for Teams organization.
1. **Cloudflare managed**: Test isolated browsing without admin controls using a Cloudflare managed `browser-beta` organization.

## Self managed
In order to test Browser Isolation with administrative controls you will need your own Cloudflare for Teams account. Follow [this guide](/administration/setup-teams) to get started.

## Cloudflare managed
Users interested in quickly testing Browser Isolation without setting up a Cloudflare for Teams organization should follow the [installation guide](/installation) to connect via the `browser-beta` organisation.
