# Installation

Important: While the Remote Browser Isolation technology only requires a web browser to function, the beta programme integrates into the end-to-end Cloudflare for Teams experience. This uses a local WARP client to proxy Internet traffic through from your computer to the nearest Cloudflare data center.

Before installing and setting up the WARP Client, ensure that your device meets the [system requirements](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/requirements) needed for client installation.

If your device meets the system requirements, follow the setup instructions for your device:

* [Windows](/installation/windows)
* [macOS](/installation/macos)
* [ChromeOS](/installation/chromeos)
