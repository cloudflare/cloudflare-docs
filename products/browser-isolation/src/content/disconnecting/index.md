# Disconnecting Browser Isolation
If you would like to temporarily disconnect Browser Isolation, you can do this by simply selecting the WARP agent and disconnecting the client.

While the WARP client is disconnected your Internet traffic does not route through Cloudflare and is not Isolated.

<Aside>
If you are having a problem with a specific website we suggest creating a <strong>Do Not Isolate</strong> policy for a specific Host in <a href="/administration/isolation-policies#disabling-isolation-for-domains">isolation policies</a>.
