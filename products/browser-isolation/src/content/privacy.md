Cloudflare Browser Isolation is a security product. In order to serve transparent isolated browsing and block web based threats our network decrypts Internet traffic using the [Cloudflare Root CA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-isolation/installation#install-the-cloudflare-root-ca). Traffic logs are retained as per the [Gateway Privacy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/gateway/privacy) documentation. Access to these logs is restricted to the administrator of the Cloudflare for Teams account (in self managed mode). Whether youâ€™re under a Cloudflare Managed or Self Managed configuration, Cloudflare commits not to share information about your Internet browsing externally and to only use such information for our own internal research and development efforts.
