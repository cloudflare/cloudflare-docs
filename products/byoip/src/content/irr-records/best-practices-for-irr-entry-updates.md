# Best practices for IRR entry updates

To add or update an IRR entry, use one of the routing registries listed in the [Internet Routing Registry](http://www.irr.net/index.html).

Suggested registries are AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, NTT, RADB, and RIPE.

## Best practices

When updating IRR entries, use these best practices:

*   If you own your own subnet, use the RIPE and APNIC routing registries. These registries allow you to verify subnet ownership.
*   If you lease your subnet, follow these guidelines:
    *   When you do not need ownership verification, use the AFRINIC or NTT routing registry.
    *   When you submit a route object via email, use the ARIN registry. Note that address blocks owned by others do not appear in the ARIN interface.

### IRR Entry instructions

Each routing registry has its own set of IRR entry instructions. This table provides links to those instructions:
