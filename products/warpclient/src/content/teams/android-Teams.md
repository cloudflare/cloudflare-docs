# Android Deployment

<Aside>

Before you get started please visit [Android Mobile Client](/setting-up/android/) to review the system requirements and find a link to the App Store.

Once you are ready, choose how you are going to deploy the client in your organization:
* [Automated](#automated-install) (Intune, Endpoint Manager, etc.)
* [Manual Configuration](#manual-configuration) (End users manually configure client on their own device)

</Aside>

If you plan to direct your users to manually download and configure the Cloudflare WARP client application, they can do so from two places in the UI:

#### Manually configure a Gateway DoH Subdomain
