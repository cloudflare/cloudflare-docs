# About Transform Rules

Transform Rules allow you to adjust the URI path, query string, and HTTP headers of incoming requests at the edge.

There are two types of Transform Rules:

* URL Rewrite Rules:

    * Rewrite the **path** of the URL of an HTTP request
    * Rewrite the **query string** of the URL of an HTTP request

* HTTP Request Header Modification Rules:

    * Set the value of an **HTTP request header**
    * Remove an **HTTP request header**

To configure Transform Rules in the dashboard, use the **Transform Rules** tab in Rules.

<ButtonGroup>
  <Button type="primary" href="/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard">Create a URL Rewrite Rule</Button>
  <Button type="primary" href="/transform/request-header-modification/create-dashboard">Create a Request Header Modification Rule</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

## Transform Rules evaluation

Transform Rules run in order. Rules that appear later in the list of Transform Rules can overwrite changes done by previous rules. You can define the rule order in the dashboard or via API.

All request fields are immutable while evaluating Transform Rules for a request. For example, if a URL Rewrite Rule #1 updates the URI path or the query string, URL Rewrite Rule #2 will not take these previous changes into consideration.

## Availability

Cloudflare Transform Rules are available to all customers. Keep in mind that support for regular expressions is based on your plan type.

## Get started

To get started building your own Transform Rules, see:

* [Create a URL Rewrite Rule in the dashboard](/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard)
* [Create an HTTP Request Header Modification Rule in the dashboard](/transform/request-header-modification/create-dashboard)

You can also create Transform Rules via API:

* [Create a URL Rewrite Rule via API](/transform/url-rewrite/create-api)
* [Create an HTTP Request Header Modification Rule via API](/transform/request-header-modification/create-api)

Check [Firewall Rules language](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-language) for more information on building expressions for Transform Rules, since the language is the same as the Firewall Rules language.
