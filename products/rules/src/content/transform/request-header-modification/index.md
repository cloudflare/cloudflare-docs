# HTTP Request Header Modification Rules

You can manipulate the headers of incoming HTTP requests through HTTP Request Header Modification Rules. Through these rules you can:

* Set the value of an HTTP request header to a literal string value, overwriting its previous value or adding a new header to the request.
* Set the value of an HTTP request header according to an expression, overwriting its previous value or adding a new header to the request.
* Remove an HTTP request header from the request (remove all headers with the provided name).

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

* You cannot modify or remove HTTP request headers whose name starts with `cf-` or `x-cf-` except for the `cf-connecting-ip` HTTP request header, which you can remove.

* If you modify the value of an existing HTTP request header using an expression that evaluates to an empty string (`""`) or an undefined value, the HTTP request header is **removed**.

* Currently, there is a limited number of HTTP request headers that you cannot modify. Cloudflare may remove restrictions for some of these HTTP request headers when presented with valid use cases. [Create a post in the community](https://community.cloudflare.com) for consideration.
