# Mass Redirects

Mass Redirects allow you to define a large number of redirects at the account level. These redirects navigate the user from a source URL to a target URL using a given HTTP status code.

These redirects are essentially static â€” they do not support any string replacement operations. However, you can configure the exact behavior of each URL Redirect by setting its options.
