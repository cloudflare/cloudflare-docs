# Manage URL Normalization in the Cloudflare dashboard

Use the **Rules** app in the Cloudflare dashboard to control [URL Normalization](/normalization) settings.

![Configure Normalization](../static/normalization/url-normalization-settings.png)

Do the following:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.

1. Select the **Websites** tab and choose the site for which you want to configure URL Normalization.

1. Click the **Rules** tile in the app bar, and then click the **Settings** tab.

1. Under **Configure Normalization**, enable or disable the [available URL Normalization settings](#available-settings).

## Available settings

The Cloudflare dashboard provides two components to manage URL Normalization:

* **Normalize incoming URLs** - Configures the URLs of all incoming traffic to Cloudflare:
    * When set to _On_ (default), all incoming URLs are normalized before they pass to subsequent Cloudflare features that can receive a URL as input, such as Page Rules, Firewall Rules, Workers and Access.
    * When set to _Off_, incoming URLs are not normalized before passing to subsequent Cloudflare features.

* **Normalize URLs to origin** - Configures URLs that are sent to the origin:
    * When set to _On_, requests sent to the origin are normalized.
    * When set to _Off_ (default), requests sent to the origin are not modified.
   
    <Aside type="note" header="Note">

    You can only view and enable this option when **Normalize incoming URLs** is also enabled.

    </Aside>

The table below shows how URL Normalization settings affect incoming URLs before they pass to other Cloudflare features and to origin.
