# API JSON objects

## Bulk Redirect Rule

A fully populated Bulk Redirect Rule object has the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "action": "redirect",
  "expression": "http.request.full_uri in $<LIST_NAME>",
  "action_parameters": {
    "from_list": {
      "name": "<LIST_NAME>",
      "key": "http.request.full_uri"
    }
  }
}
```

`key` is an expression that defines the value that will be matched against the configured URL Redirectâ€™s source URL values, following the rules of the URL matching algorithm. Refer to [Concepts: Bulk Redirect Rules](/bulk-redirects/concepts#bulk-redirect-rules) for more information.

The JSON object properties must comply with the following:

* `action` must be `redirect`
* `action_parameters` must contain a `from_list` object with additional settings.
* `from_list` must contain the following properties:
    * `name`: The name of an existing Bulk Redirect List to associate with the current Bulk Redirect Rule.
    * `expression` must reference the request field used in the `key` property. Refer to [Concepts: Bulk Redirect Rules](/bulk-redirects/concepts#bulk-redirect-rules) for more information.
