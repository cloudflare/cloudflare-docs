# Proxied DNS records


For more information about proxied DNS records, refer to [Identifying subdomains compatible with Cloudflare's proxy](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200169626).

<Aside type="note">

You can only proxy **A**, **AAAA**, and **CNAME** records. All other record types will be DNS only.
