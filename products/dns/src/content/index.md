# Overview

Cloudflare's mission is to be the fastest, most resilient, and simplest managed DNS platform to meet our customer's and partner's DNS needs.

## Benefits

When you use Cloudflare DNS, all DNS queries for your domain are answered by [Cloudflare's global anycast network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/). This network allows us to deliver supreme performance while guaranteeing global availability.

Our anycast network also allows us to mitigate [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) directed at any site using Cloudflare nameservers, whether they are paying us a lot or nothing at all.

Beyond these benefits, Cloudflare authoritative DNS also provides [free DNSSEC](/additional-options/dnssec) and protects against [route leaks and hijacking](https://isbgpsafeyet.com/).

## Availability

Cloudflare's authoritative DNS is available to all customers for free. Other types of DNS setups may be limited to specific plan types. For additional details, refer to [Zone setup options](/zone-setups).
