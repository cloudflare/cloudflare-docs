*When users purchase Bot Management for Enterprise, Cloudflare automatically replaces Bot Fight Mode to prevent configuration overlap.

## Which bot solution do I need?

If you have a smaller site and have identified a bot problem, we recommend Bot Fight Mode which is free for all customers. You can enable Bot Fight Mode from your dashboard, but you cannot set specific bot rules or tune your configuration.

If you have a large, sophisticated site with a lot of traffic, we recommend Bot Management for Enterprise, especially for customers in ecommerce, banking and security. To enable Bot Management for Enterprise and write rules to customize your bot protection, contact the Solutions Engineering team.
