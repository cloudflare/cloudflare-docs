# Get started with Cloudflare Waiting Room

---

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, make sure you have:
- Completed the [prerequisites](/about#prerequisites).
- Reviewed your [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/rate-limiting) to make sure they allow at least one request every 20 seconds (required for automatic page refreshes).

## Step 1 — Plan out your waiting room

Before you create your waiting room, think about how you want it to appear and operate.

### Location

Which page will you cover with a waiting room? You can only have one waiting room per page, so you need to identify the high-traffic areas of your website.

Specify the URL for your page by setting the `hostname` and `path` in your [configuration settings](/reference/configuration-settings).

### Access method

You can direct visitors to your high-traffic page:
- Directly (via URL)
- Indirectly (via a [Page Rule redirect](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172286))

### Queue activation

When you [activate your waiting room](#step-3--activate-your-waiting-room), choose whether:
- [**All visitors**](#queue-all-visitors) to be queued, in preparation for a product release or other time-based event
- Only [**some visitors**](#queue-some-visitors) to be queued, as traffic reaches the thresholds defined in `Total active users` and `New users per minute`

### Appearance (optional)

Some customers can [customize the design](/additional-options/customize-waiting-room) of their waiting room by editing the page HTML and CSS.

If you have this ability, think about how you want the page to appear.

## Step 2 — Create your waiting room

Create your waiting room by:
- Using the [dashboard](/how-to/create-via-dashboard).
- Using the [API](/how-to/create-via-api).

## Step 3 — Activate your waiting room

Depending on your [queue activation](#queue-activation), you may deploy your waiting room differently.

### Queue some visitors

<QueueSome/>

### Queue all visitors

<QueueAll/>

## Step 4 — Next steps

After you have created and deployed your first waiting room, you might also want to:
- [Test your waiting room](/additional-options/test-waiting-room) before it goes live.
- [Monitor your traffic](/how-to/monitor-waiting-room) in real time.
- [Troubleshoot](/troubleshooting) potential issues.
