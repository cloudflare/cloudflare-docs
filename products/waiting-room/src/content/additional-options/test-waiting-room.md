# Test a waiting room

Follow this tutorial to ensure your Waiting Room queues and admits users as expected.

<Aside type="warning" header="Warning:">
This tutorial uses an open-sourced load testing tool that is not created or supported by Cloudflare.
</Aside>

---

## Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, ensure you have:
- Fulfilled all the [prerequisites](../../about#prerequisites)
- Previously [created a waiting room](/get-started)
- Updated the [sample script](#1-download-sample-script) to ensure your waiting room captures when a "simulated user" enters and is released from your waiting room (if you [customized the design](/additional-options/customize-waiting-room) of your waiting room)

---

## 1. Download sample script

First, download the [sample script](https://github.com/kcantrel/test-cf-waitingroom/blob/master/simulate_requests) from GitHub.

This script simulates users entering a waiting room. It divides traffic into two phases (`Phase 1` and `Phase 2`) so you can test wait times as load increases and then decreases.

## 2. Run sample script

Once you have downloaded the script, run it with the following command-line arguments:
-  `-n <num_secs_p1>`: Number of seconds to send requests during phase 1
- `-m <num_secs_p2>`: Number of seconds to send requests during phase 2, which is fixed at 1 request per second
- `-s <sleep_time_p1>`: Amount of time to sleep between requests during phase 1 (fractional time accepted, such as `.3`)
- `-o <results>`: File to store the per-session statistics
- `URL`: Endpoint protected by a Cloudflare Waiting Room

  <summary>Example script run</summary>
  <div>
    <strong>Function</strong>

    simulate_requests -s .1 -n 60 -m 60 -o results https://example.com/tickets/1234/

<strong>Output</strong>

    Sending 600 requests to https://example.com/tickets/1234/ at a rate of 10.00 per second. Or 600 per minute.

As the script runs, it will output characters with each character representing:
- A user session that advanced past the waiting room
- The amount of time the user spent in the waiting room:
  - 0 seconds: `.`
  - 10 seconds: `a`
  - 20 seconds: `b`
  - 30 seconds: `c`<br/>
    ...
  - 260 seconds: `A`
  - 270 seconds: `B`<br/>
    ...
  - 530 seconds: `0`
  - 540 seconds: `1`<br/>
    ...
  - Greater than 620 seconds: `!`

## 3. Analyze results

Once the script finishes running, it creates a CSV file with the following fields:

<details>
  <summary>Fields in CSV file</summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>job</strong>: The fixed string will either be <strong>main</strong> for phase 1 or <strong>post</strong> for phase 2</li>
       <li><strong>status</strong>: Status of the last response of the session:</li>
       <ul>
            <li>0: curl command received an HTTP status code of <code>200</code></li>
            <li>1: curl command did not receive any HTTP status codes, which typically means the curl command itself failed</li>
            <li>2: curl command received an HTTP status code of something other than <code>200</code></li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>wait_time</strong>: Number of seconds the user waited in the waiting room</li>
       <li><strong>wr_cnt_before</strong>: Number of users in the waiting room when the session first started</li>
       <li><strong>wr_cnt_after</strong>: Number of users in the waiting room when the session made it past the waiting room</li>
       <li><strong>start_time</strong>: Time when the session first started (in UNIX epoch seconds)</li>
       <li><strong>end_time</strong>: Time when the session made it past the waiting room (in UNIX epoch seconds)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</details>

To visualize your results, open your CSV file within a spreadsheet application. For example, here is a basic chart that shows the amount of time a user waited verses the time they first tried to get to the web service:

![Visualize waiting room test data by using a graphing tool](../static/test-waiting-room.png)

In this example, you can clearly see when the script entered the second phase — with a reduced rate of new users per second — leading to decreased wait times.

## 4. Adjust waiting room (optional)

Based on the results of your test, you may want to adjust [the settings](/reference/configuration-settings) of your waiting room.
