Cloudflare supports SSL/TLS when connecting to customers' origin servers. 

Free SSL certificates for your origin can be issued using Cloudflare's [Origin CA](/ssl/origin/origin-ca).

Control over the scheme and certificate validation options used for the origin connection are described in [SSL modes](/ssl/origin/ssl-modes).
