  <Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

  You can only use API Shield with a certificate authority (CA) that is fully managed by Cloudflare. Cloudflare generates a unique CA for each zone.

  If you need to use certificates issued by another CA, use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/mutual-tls-authentication?">Cloudflare Access</a> to upload your own CA.
