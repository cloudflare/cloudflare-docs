1. In the certificate details, click **Revoke** and confirm the operation.

After revoking a certificate, you must update any mTLS rules that check for the presence of a client certificate so that they block all requests that include a revoked certificate.

For more information, see [Check for revoked certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-dashboard/create-mtls-rule#check-for-revoked-certificates).
