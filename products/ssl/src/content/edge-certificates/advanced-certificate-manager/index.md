## Features

Advanced certificates allow you multiple customization options:

- Include the zone apex and less than 50 hosts as covered hostnames.
- Cover more than one level of subdomain.
- Select the preferred validation method (HTTP, TXT, or Email).
- Choose the certificate validity period (14, 30, 90, or 365 days).
- Choose the Certificate Authority to issue the certificate (Letâ€™s Encrypt or Digicert).
- Remove Cloudflare branding that are normally present on Universal certificates.
- Select a custom trust store for origin authentication.
- Control [cipher suites used for TLS](/ssl-tls/cipher-suites#disable-cipher-suites).

Enterprise customers can also purchase a subscription for Advanced Certificate Manager, which allows them to add up to 100 edge certificates per zone.
