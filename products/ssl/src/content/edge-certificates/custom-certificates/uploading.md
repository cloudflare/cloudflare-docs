# Uploading

Custom Certificates can be uploaded in the Cloudflare Dashboard or using the Cloudflare API.

--------

## Certificate requirements

Certificates are parsed and checked for validity before being accepted. Each certificate uploaded must:

* Be encoded in PEM format
* Not have a key file password
* Not be expiring in less than 14 days from time of upload
* Have a subject alternative name (SAN) matching at least one hostname in the zone where it’s being uploaded
* Use a private key greater than or equal to a minimum length (currently 2048 bit for RSA and 225 bit for ECDSA)
* Be publicly trusted by a major browser, unless the `User Defined` bundling method is used

--------

## Using the Cloudflare API

The call below will upload a certificate for use with www.example.com. Cloudflare will automatically bundle the certificate with a certificate chain optimized for maximum compatibility with browsers.

Note that if you are using an ECC key generated by OpenSSL, you will need to first remove the `-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----...-----END EC PARAMETERS-----` section of the file.

### Step 1 — Replace line endings with the string “\n” and build the payload

```bash
$ cat app_example_com.pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFJDCCBAygAwIBAgIQD0ifmj/Yi5NP/2gdUySbfzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBN
MQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEVMBMGA1UEChMMRGlnaUNlcnQgSW5jMScwJQYDVQQDEx5E

OeH8gMJ+FuwtXYEPa4hBf38M5eU5xWG7
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

$ MYCERT="$(cat www_example_com.pem|perl -pe 's/\r?\n/\\n/'|sed -e 's/..$//')"
$ MYKEY="$(cat www_example_com.key|perl -pe 's/\r?\n/\\n/'|sed -e's/..$//')"
```

With the certificate and key saved to environment variables (using escaped newlines), we build the payload:

```bash
$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
	"certificate": "$MYCERT",
	"private_key": "$MYKEY",
	"bundle_method":"ubiquitous"
}
EOF
))
```

You can optionally add [geographic restrictions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-geo-key-manager/) that specify where your private key can physically be decrypted:

```bash
$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
	"certificate": "$MYCERT",
	"private_key": "$MYKEY",
	"bundle_method":"ubiquitous",
	"geo_restrictions":{"label":"us"}'
}
))
```
You can also enable support for legacy clients which do not include SNI in the TLS handshake.

```bash
$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
	"certificate": "$MYCERT",
	"private_key": "$MYKEY",
	"bundle_method":"ubiquitous",
	"geo_restrictions":{"label":"us"}',
	"type":"sni_custom"
}
))
```
`sni_custom` is recommended by Cloudflare. Use `legacy_custom` when a specific client requires non-SNI support. The Cloudflare API treats all Custom SSL certificates as Legacy by default.  

### Step 2 — Upload your certificate and key

```bash
$ curl -sX POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/custom_certificates \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: {email}" -H "X-Auth-Key: {key}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$request_body"
```
