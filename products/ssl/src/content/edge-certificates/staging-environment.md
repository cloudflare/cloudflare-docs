# Staging environment (Beta)

Use your certificate staging environment to test new custom (modern) certificates before pushing them to your production environment. This process helps you solve potential certificate problems **before** there's an incident, such as when:

- You make a mistake when uploading a new custom certificate.
- You misunderstand the order of your certificates.
- Clients have previously pinned your custom certificate, causing a TLS termination error.

<Aside type="note">

Staging environments are available only to Enterprise customers as part of an open beta. For access, reach out to your Account team.

## Use your staging environment

### Step 1 — Upload certificate

To upload custom (modern) certificates to your staging environment:

1. Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Staging Certificates**.
1. Click **Upload Custom Staging Certificate**.
1. Upload your custom (modern) certificate ([detailed instructions](/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading)).
1. Your certificate will appear in the dashboard with a status of **Staging Deployment**. If you refresh the page, its status should go to **Staging Active**.

### Step 2 — Test certificate

Test your custom (modern) certificate by sending `curl` requests to the IP addresses listed in the dashboard card at **SSL/TLS** > **Staging Certificates**.

You should confirm whether:

- TLS termination is successful.
- The right certificate is being served at the edge.
- Any clients are pinning the old certificate.

### Step 3 — Push certificate to production

Asssuming there are no issues, push your custom (modern) certificate to your production environment:

1. Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Staging Certificates**.
1. Click a custom certificate.
1. Click **Push to Production**.

If there were issues with your certificate, you can keep it in your staging environment or click **Deactivate** on the certificate itself.

### Step 4 (optional) — Push certificate back to staging

If you roll out a custom (modern) certificate to production and encounter issues, you can push that certificate back to your staging environment for additional testing:

1. Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
1. Click a custom certificate.
1. Click **Push to Staging**.
