# Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)

<CSRDefinition/>

A CSR contains information about your domain: your organization name and address, the common name (domain name), and Subject Alternative Names (SANs). The private key associated with the CSR will be generated by Cloudflare and will never leave our network.

<Aside type="note">

At the moment, CSRs are only available to Enterprise customers who have purchased an account-level subscription for [Advanced Certificate Manager](/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager).

</Aside>

## Types of CSRs

You can create two types of CSRs:

- **Zone-level**: Meant only for sign certificates associated with the current zone.
- **Account-level**: Meant for organizations that issue certificates across multiple domains. 

## Create and use a CSR

To create a CSR:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and an application.
1. Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
1. On **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**, click **Generate**.
1. Choose a **Scope** (only [certain customers](#types-of-csrs) can choose **Account**.
1. Enter relevant information on the form and click **Create**.

To use a CSR:

1. Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
1. On **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**, select the record you just created.
1. Copy (or click **Click to copy**) the value for **Certificate Signing Request**.
1. Obtain a certificate from the Certificate Authority (CA) of your choice using your CSR.
1. When you [upload the custom certificate](/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading) to Cloudflare, select an **Encoding mode** of **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** and enter the associated value.

    <Aside type="note">
    
    You will not see the option to adjust your **Encoding Mode** until after you have created a CSR associated with the specific zone or your account.
