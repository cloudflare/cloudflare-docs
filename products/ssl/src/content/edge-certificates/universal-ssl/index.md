# Universal SSL

Cloudflare issues — and renews — free, publicly trusted SSL certificates to all Cloudflare domains. 

When you proxy your traffic through Cloudflare, this process happens **automatically and within 24 hours of domain activation**. Provisioning time depends on certain security checks and other requirements mandated by Certificate Authorities (CA).

When you **do not proxy** your traffic through Cloudflare (a CNAME setup), you will need to perform the additional steps described in [Enable Universal SSL](enable-universal-ssl#non-authoritative-partial-domains).

<Aside type="note">

For sites that require an SSL certificate prior to migrating traffic to Cloudflare, purchase <a href="../advanced-certificate-manager">Advanced Certificate Manager</a> or upload a <a href="../custom-certificates">Custom SSL certificate</a> before proxying traffic to Cloudflare.
