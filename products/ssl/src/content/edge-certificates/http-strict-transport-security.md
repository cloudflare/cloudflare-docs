# HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HSTS protects HTTPS web servers from downgrade attacks. These attacks redirect web browsers from an HTTPS web server to an attacker-controlled server, allowing bad actors to compromise user data and cookies.

HSTS adds an HTTP header that directs [compliant web browsers](/ssl-tls/browser-compatibility) to:
- Transform HTTP links to HTTPS links
- Prevent users from bypassing SSL browser warnings 

Before enabling HSTS, review the [requirements](#requirements).

## Requirements

In order for HSTS to work as expected, you need to:
- Have enabled HTTPS before HSTS so browsers can accept your HSTS settings
- Keep HTTPS enabled so visitors can access your site

Once you enabled HSTS, avoid the following actions to ensure visitors can still access your site:
- Changing your DNS records from [Proxied to DNS only](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200169626)
- [Pausing Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/203118044#h_8654c523-e31e-4f40-a3c7-0674336a2753) on your site
- Pointing your nameservers away from Cloudflare
- Redirecting HTTPS to HTTP
- Disabling SSL (invalid or expired certificates or certificates with mismatched host names)

<Aside type="warning">

If you remove HTTPS before disabling HSTS or before waiting for the duration of the original <strong>Max Age Header</strong> specified in your Cloudflare HSTS configuration, your website becomes inaccessible to visitors for the duration of the Max Age Header or until you enable HTTPS.

## Enable HSTS

To enable HSTS for your website:
1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
1. Select your website.
1. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
1. For **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, click **Enable HSTS**.
1. Read the dialog and click **I understand**.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Configure the [HSTS settings](#configuration-settings).
1. Click **Save**.

    

## Disable HSTS

To disable HSTS on your website:
1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
1. Select your website.
1. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
1. For **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, click **Enable HSTS**.
1. Set the **Max Age Header** to **0 (Disable)**.
1. If you previously enabled the **No-Sniff** header and want to remove it, set it to **Off**.  
1. Click **Save**.

        <td>Preload</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Permits browsers to automatically preload HSTS configuration. Prevents an attacker from downgrading a first request form HTTPS to HTTP. Preload can make a website without HTTPS completely inaccessible.</td>
        <td>Off / On</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>No-Sniff Header</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Sends the <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header to prevent Internet Explorer and Chrome from automatically detecting a content type other than those explicitly specified by the Content-Type header.</td>
        <td>Off / On</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Aside type='note'>

Once HSTS <strong>Preload</strong> is configured, submit requests for addition to each browserâ€™s preload list. Chrome, Firefox/Mozilla, and Safari use the Chrome preload list. A minimum <strong>Max Age Header</strong> of 12 months is required for inclusion in HSTS preload lists.
