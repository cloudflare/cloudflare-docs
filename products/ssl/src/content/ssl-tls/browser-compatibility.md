# Browser compatibility

Cloudflare attempts to provide compatibility for as wide a range of user agents (browsers, API clients, etc.) as possible. The specific set of supported browsers differs by SSL product, however. See below for specific details.

## Universal SSL

Feature/Zone Plan | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise
------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------
Clients using ECDSA key exchange|✅|✅|✅|✅
Clients using RSA key exchange|❌|✅|✅|✅

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

Cloudflare Universal SSL only supports browsers and API clients that use the [Server Name Indication (SNI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/) extension to the TLS protocol.

</Aside>

### Free plan
Universal SSL certificates issued for Free plan zones require user agents that send Server Name Indication (SNI) and support the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). SNI and ECDSA certificates work with these modern browsers:

**Desktop Browsers installed on Windows Vista or OS X 10.6 or later**:

* Internet Explorer 7
* Firefox 2
* Opera 8 (with TLS 1.1 enabled)
* Google Chrome v5.0.342.0
* Safari 2.1
* Mobile Browsers

**Mobile Safari for iOS 4.0**:

* Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) and later
* Windows Phone 7

### Paid plans

Paid plans provide additional compatibility with older browsers/operating systems, such as Windows XP and Android 3.0 and earlier.

<Aside type='note' header='Note'>

SNI extensions to the TLS protocol were standardized in 2003. However, some browsers and operating systems only implemented this extension when TLS 1.1 was released in 2006 (or 2011 for mobile browsers). If your visitors use devices that have not been updated since 2011, they may not have SNI support.
