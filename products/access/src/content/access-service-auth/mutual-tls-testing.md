# Mutual TLS testing

You can use Cloudflare's open source tools for private key infrastructure (PKI) to test the mTLS feature in Cloudflare Access. This guide details the process to generate a Root Client Authority (CA), add it to the Cloudflare dashboard, and issue client certificates that can authenticate against the root CA and reach a protected resource.

## Installing dependencies

The process requires two packages from Cloudflare's PKI toolkit:
`cf-ssl`
`cfssljson`

You can install these packages from the [Cloudflare SSL GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl). You will need a working installation of Go, version 1.12 or later. Alternatively, you can [download the packages](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) directly.
Use the instructions under Installation to install the toolkit, and ensure that you install all of the utility programs in the toolkit.

## Generating the Root CA

1. Create a new directory to store the Root CA.

2. Within that directory, create two new files:

* **CSR**. Create a file named `ca-csr.json` and add the following JSON blob, then save the file.

```json
{
  "CN": "Access Testing CA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 4096
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "US",
      "L": "Austin",
      "O": "Access Testing",
      "OU": "TX",
      "ST": "Texas"
    }
  ]
}
```

* **config**. Create a file named `ca-config.json` and add the following JSON blob, then save the file.

```json
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "8760h"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "server": {
        "usages": ["signing", "key encipherment", "server auth"],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      },
      "client": {
        "usages": ["signing","key encipherment","client auth"],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Now, run the following command to generate the Root CA with those files.

```sh
$ cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
```

4. Within the directory, check its content to confirm the output was successful.

```sh
$ ls
```

The output should now return the following content:

```bash
ca-config.json	ca-csr.json	ca-key.pem	ca.csr		ca.pem
```

## Generating a client certificate

Returning to the terminal, generate a client certificate that will authenticate against the Root CA uploaded. This example creates a new directory to keep client certificates separate from the Root CA working location for ease of management.

1. Create a file named `client-csr.json` and add the following JSON blob:

```json
{
  "CN": "James Royal",
  "hosts": [""],
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 4096
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "US",
      "L": "Austin",
      "O": "Access",
      "OU": "Access Admins",
      "ST": "Texas"
    }
  ]
}
```
2. Now, use the following command to generate a client certificate with the Cloudflare PKI toolkit:

```sh
$ cfssl gencert -ca=../mtls-test/ca.pem -ca-key=../mtls-test/ca-key.pem  -config=../mtls-test/ca-config.json -profile=client client-csr.json | cfssljson -bare client
```

3. You can now test the client certificate with the following `cURL` command.

```sh
$ curl -v --cert client.pem --key client-key.pem https://iot.widgetcorp.tech
```

## Testing in the browser


The instructions here cover usage with a computer running MacOS.

1. In the same working directory, run the following command to add the client certificate into the MacOS Keychain.



<Aside>

Warning: this will add the client certificate to the trusted store on your device. Only proceed if you are comfortable doing so and intend to keep these testing certificates safeguarded.
</Aside>

```sh
$ open client.pem
$ security import client-key.pem -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

2. Click on the certificate in the Keychain list to set the certificate to trusted. Confirm that the certificate is listed in *My Certificates*.

## Creating a CRL

You can use the Cloudflare PKI toolkit to generate a certificate revocation list (CRL), as well. This list will contain client certificates that are revoked.
1. Get the serial number from the client certificate generated earlier. Add that serial number, or any others you intend to revoke, in hex format in a text file. This example uses a file named `serials.txt`.

2. Create the CRL with the following command.
```bash
cfssl gencrl serials.txt ../mtls-test/ca.pem ../mtls-test/ca-key.pem | base64 -D > ca.crl
You will need to add this to your server or enforce the revocation in a Cloudflare Worker.
```
