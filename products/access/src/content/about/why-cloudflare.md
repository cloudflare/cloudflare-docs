title: "Why Cloudflare?"

To make infrastructure safer, and web properties faster, Cloudflare built out one of the world’s largest and most sophisticated networks. Cloudflare for Teams builds on that same platform, and all of its unique advantages.

## Fast
Security should always be bundled with performance. Cloudflare’s infrastructure products delivered better protection while also improving speed. That’s possible because of the network we’ve built, both its distribution and how the data we have about the network allows Cloudflare to optimize requests and connections.

Cloudflare for Teams brings that same speed to end users by using that same network and route optimization. Additionally, Cloudflare has built industry-leading components that will become features of this new platform. All of these components leverage Cloudflare’s network and scale to improve user performance.

Gateway’s DNS-filtering features build on Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, the world’s fastest resolver according to DNSPerf. To protect entire connections, Cloudflare for Teams will deploy the same technology that underpins Warp, a new type of VPN with consistently better reviews than competitors.

## Massive scalability
Cloudflare’s 30 TBps of network capacity can scale to meet the needs of nearly any enterprise. Customers can stop worrying about buying enough hardware to meet their organization’s needs and, instead, replace it with Cloudflare.

## Near users, wherever they are — literally
Cloudflare’s network operates in 200 cities and more than 90 countries around the world, putting Cloudflare’s security and performance close to users, wherever they work.

That network includes presence in global headquarters, like London and New York, but also in traditionally underserved regions around the world.

Cloudflare data centers operate within 100 milliseconds of 99% of Internet-connected population in the developed world, and within 100 milliseconds of 94% of the Internet-connected population globally. All of your end users should feel like they have the performance traditionally only available to those in headquarters.

## Easier for administrators
When security products are confusing, teams make mistakes that become incidents. Cloudflare’s solution is straightforward and easy to deploy. Most security providers in this market built features first and never considered usability or implementation.

Cloudflare Access can be deployed in less than an hour; Gateway features will build on top of that dashboard and workflow. Cloudflare for Teams brings the same ease-of-use of our tools that protect infrastructure to the products that new secure users, devices, and data.
