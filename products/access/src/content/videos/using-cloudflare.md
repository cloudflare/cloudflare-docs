# Set up Cloudflare

## Getting started with Cloudflare

To get started with Cloudflare Access, you’ll need to have an active domain on Cloudflare. This video will walk you through changing your domain registrar’s nameservers to point to Cloudflare’s servers. 

The domain you are using with Access does not need to be the same one used by your internal DNS or used for a public audience. Once that hostname is on Cloudflare, you can deploy applications, machines, and remote desktops as subdomains that are secured with Cloudflare Access.
