# Configure exposed credentials check in the dashboard

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

The Exposed Credentials Check Managed Ruleset is only available in the Cloudflare WAF announced on March 2021.

</Aside>

To enable exposed credentials checking in the Cloudflare dashboard, enable the Exposed Credentials Check Managed Ruleset. After enabling the ruleset, you can configure its behavior by changing the action and status of individual rules or in bulk.

For more information, check [Deploy Managed Rulesets for a zone in the dashboard](/managed-rulesets/deploy-zone-dashboard).
