# Cloudflare Web Application Firewall

The Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides both automatic protection from vulnerabilities and the flexibility to create custom rules.

## Main features

* **Custom Rules**: Create your own Custom Firewall Rules to protect your website and your APIs from malicious incoming traffic.
* **Rate Limiting rules**: Define rate limits for incoming requests matching an expression, and the action to take when those rate limits are reached.
* **WAF Managed Rulesets**: Enable the pre-configured Managed Rulesets to get immediate protection. These rulesets are regularly updated, offering advanced zero-day vulnerability protections. Adjust the behavior of managed rules, choosing from several possible actions.
* **Exposed Credential Checks**: Monitor and block use of stolen/exposed credentials for account takeover.
* **Firewall Analytics**: Identify and investigate security threats using an intuitive interface. Tailor your security configurations based on the activity log.

## Availability

The Cloudflare WAF is available to all Cloudflare plans, but the exact features and limits depend on your current plan. Rate limiting is a paid add-on on all plans.
