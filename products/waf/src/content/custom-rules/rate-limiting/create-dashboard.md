Create Rate Limiting rules under the **Custom Rules** tab in the **Firewall** app.

## Create a Rate Limiting rule

To create a new Rate Limiting rule:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.

1. Select the **Websites** tab and choose the site for which you want to create a rule.

1. Navigate to **Firewall** > **Custom Rules**.

1. Click **Create Custom rule** > **Rate limiting rule**.

1. In the page that displays, enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

1. Under **If incoming requests match...**, use the **Field** drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for **Field** is compared to the value you specify for **Value** using the operator selected in **Operator**.

1. Under **With the same...**, add one or more characteristics that will define the request counters for rate limiting purposes. Each value combination will have its own counter to determine the request rate. Check [Determining the request rate](/custom-rules/rate-limiting/request-rate) for more information.

1. Under **And rate exceeds...**, define the rate limit and the time period to consider when determining the request rate.

1. Select the rule action from the **Choose action** drop-down list. For example, selecting _Block_ tells Cloudflare to refuse requests in the conditions you specified when the request limit is reached.

1. Under **For...**, select the mitigation timeout. This is the time period during which Cloudflare applies the select action once the request rate is reached.

1. To save and deploy your rule, click **Save and Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, click **Save as Draft**.
