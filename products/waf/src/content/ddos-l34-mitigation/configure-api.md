# Configure the L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset via API

Configure the Cloudflare L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset by defining overrides at the account level using the [Rulesets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api).

Each account has the Cloudflare L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset enabled by default. This means that you do not need to deploy the Managed Ruleset to the `ddos_l4` phase entry point ruleset explicitly. You only have to create a rule in the phase entry point to deploy the Managed Ruleset if you need to configure overrides.

## Configure an override for the L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset

You can define overrides at the ruleset, tag, and rule level for all Managed Rulesets.

When configuring the Cloudflare L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset, use overrides to define a different **action** or **sensitivity** from the default values. For more information on these rule parameters and the allowed values, refer to [Managed Ruleset parameters](/ddos-l34-mitigation/override-parameters).

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

The Cloudflare L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset is always enabled. You cannot disable its rules using an override with `"enabled": false`.

You can only define overrides for the Cloudflare L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset at the account level.

## Example

The following `PUT` example creates a new phase ruleset (or updates the existing one) for the `ddos_l4` phase at the account level. The request includes several overrides to adjust the default behavior of the L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset. These overrides are the following:

* All rules of the L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset will have their sensitivity set to `medium`.
* All rules tagged with the tag `{tag-name}` will have their sensitivity set to `low`.
* The rule with ID `{rule-id}` will use the `block` action.

The overrides apply to all packets matching the rule expression: `ip.dst in { 1.1.1.0/24 }`.

```json
curl -X PUT \

-H "X-Auth-Key: REDACTED"
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account-id}/rulesets/phases/ddos_l4/entrypoint" \

  "description": "Define overrides for the Cloudflare L3/4 DDoS Managed Ruleset",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "execute",
      "expression": "ip.dst in { 1.1.1.0/24 }",
      "action_parameters": {
        "id": "{l34-managed-ruleset-id}",
        "overrides": {
          "sensitivity_level": "medium",
          "categories": [
            {
              "category": "{tag-name}",
              "sensitivity_level": "low"
            }
          ],
          "rules": [
            {
              "id": "{rule-id}",
              "action": "block"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

The response returns the created (or updated) phase entry point ruleset.
