## Phases of deployed Managed Rulesets

When you enable a Managed Ruleset in the **WAF** tab, you are deploying that Managed Ruleset to the zone-level `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

Other Managed Rulesets, like DDoS Managed Rulesets, are deployed to a different phase. Check the specific Managed Ruleset documentation for details.
