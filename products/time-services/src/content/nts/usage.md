# Using Cloudflare's Secure Time Service

[Chrony](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/doc/devel/chrony.conf.html) and [NTPSec](https://www.ntpsec.org/) have support for NTS. Please read the relevant documentation for guidance on setting them up to point to our time service, `time.cloudflare.com`.

## Time Services Mailing List

If you would like to hear about the development of additional clients,
updates on our service, or would like to announce that your client
supports NTS, please email `time-services@cloudflare.com` to be added
to our distribution list.
