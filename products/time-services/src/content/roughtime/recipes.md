# Advanced Usage

This section describes a few ways you can use Roughtime to keep your clock in
sync. These recipes will use Cloudflare's Go package, which is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/roughtime). It's based on Google's [Go
client](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime/+/master/go/client/), which
has some interesting additional features. The protocol is also implemented in
[C++](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime/+/master),
[Rust](https://github.com/int08h/roughenough), and
[Java](https://github.com/int08h/nearenough).

The client configuration consists of a list of named Roughtime servers
formatted as a JSON object. For example:
```
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Cloudflare-Roughtime",
      "publicKeyType": "ed25519",
      "publicKey": "gD63hSj3ScS+wuOeGrubXlq35N1c5Lby/S+T7MNTjxo=",
      "addresses": [
        {
          "protocol": "udp",
          "address": "roughtime.cloudflare.com:2002"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
It includes each server's *root public key*.  When the server starts, it
generates an *online* public/secret key pair; the root secret key is used to
create a *delegation* for the online public key, and the online secret key is
used to sign the response. The delegation  serves the same function as a
traditional [X.509 certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on the web:
the client first uses the root public key to verify the delegation, then uses
the online public key to verify the response.

ng response: 2018-09-12 16:59:39.141 -0700 PDT Â±1s (in 26ms)
*auditable* in this manner makes them accountable to provide accurate time.
The configuration also encodes the type of signature algorithm used by the
server. (Currently only [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) is
supported.) Lastly, the configuration contains a list of addresses where the
service can be reached, and which transport protocol to use to reach them.
(Currently only UDP is supported.)


## TLS
As a warm up , let's see how to sync a TLS client or server using a single
Roughtime server.  What
we're going to do is compute the time difference between our clock and the
Roughtime sever's. The first step is to load the configuration file (be sure to
import `github.com/cloudflare/roughtime`):

```
servers, skipped, err := roughtime.LoadConfig("roughtime.config")
```
Variable `servers` is the list of valid server configurations parsed from the
input file; variable `skipped` indicates the number of servers that were
skipped, say, if the signature algorithm or transport protocol isn't supported.
Next, let's get the system time and query the first server in the list:
```
t0 := time.Now()
rt, err := roughtime.Get(&servers[0], attempts, timeout, nil)
```
This sends a request to the server and verifies the response.  Variable `rt` is
of type `*roughtime.Roughtime` and represents the result of the query. The
inputs are:

  1. the server's configuration;
  2. the number of attempts to dial the server;
  3. the time to wait for each dial attempt; and
  4. an optional `*roughtime.Roughtime`, the result of a prior query.

If the last parameter is provided, then it's used generate the nonce for the
request. (More on this later.) The `crypto/tls` package allows the user to
[specify a callback](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config) for the current
time to use when validating certificates, session tickets, etc.  You can compute
this callback as follows:
```
t1, radius := rt.Now()
delta := t1.Sub(t0.Now())
now := func() time.Time {
  return time.Now().Add(delta)
}
```
Variable `t1` is the time reported by the server and `radius` is the server's
uncertainty radius.  For a full working example, check out our
[GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/roughtime/blob/master/recipes/tls.go).


## Desktop alerts

A more general way to use Roughtime is to create desktop alerts that warn you
when your clock is skewed. On Ubuntu GNU/Linux, you can do something like this:
```
skew := time.Duration(math.Abs(float64(delta)))
if skew > 10*time.Second {
  summmary := "Check your clock!"
  body := fmt.Sprintf("%s says it's off by %v.", servers[0].Name, skew)
  cmd := exec.Command("notify-send", "-i", "clock", summary, body)
  if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
    // error handling ...
  }
}
```
See our
[GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/roughtime/tree/master/recipes/alerter.go)
for a fully fleshed out alerter. (It has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.) Run this
as a cron job to periodically check that you're clock is in sync.


## Using multiple sources

Using multiple sources for Roughtime is easy (and highly recommended!):
```
t0 := time.Now()
res := roughtime.Do(servers, attempts, timeout, nil)
```
The first parameter is a sequence of servers, and the remaining parameters are
the same as in `roughtime.Get()`.  This queries each server in the sequence
`servers` in order. The output `res` is a slice the same length as `servers`.
Each element represents the result of the query to the server: if the query was
successful, then the result contains the server's time; if unsuccessful, then
the result contains the error that occurred. To compute the average difference
between your clock and the valid responses:
```
thresh := 10 * time.Second
delta, err := roughtime.AvgDeltaWithRadiusThresh(res, t0, thresh)
```
This rejects responses whose uncertainty radii exceed 10 seconds. (An error will
be returned if there were no valid responses.)

### Auditing Your Sources
Function `roughtime.Do()` chains together valid responses, generating each nonce
using the server's response in the last successful query. As we discuss in
more detail in the [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/roughtime/), linking queries together in this manner
results in cryptographic proof that the queries were made in order. To verify
that the results have this property, you can do the following:
```
chain := roughtime.NewChain(results)
ok, err := chain.Verify(nil)
if err != nil || !ok {
  // error handling ...
}
```
Variable `chain` is a structure that contains the first successful query in
`results`; it has a field, `chain.Next`, that points to the next successful
query. The input parameter to `Verify()` allows you to use a previous result as
a starting point for verifying the chain. For example, if `chain.Verify(nil)` is
valid, then `chain.Next.Verify(chain.Roughtime)` will be valid, too.

### Being Verbose
It's possible to have `roughtime.Do()` output useful information as it executes
its queries. To do so, invoke `roughtime.SetLogger()` to set a logger. For
example:
```
roughtime.SetLogger(log.New(os.Stdout, "", 0))
```
