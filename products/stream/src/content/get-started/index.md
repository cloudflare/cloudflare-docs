# Get started

To get started, open the [Stream Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/stream) or [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/stream). Your stream videos are not attached to a domain in your Cloudflare account, and you do not need a domain on Cloudflare to use Stream.

## Prerequisites

Before you can make your first request to the Stream API, you must have the following information:

- Your Cloudflare Account ID
- A Cloudflare Account API Token

## 1: Upload your first video

Stream provides multiple ways to upload videos to fit your needs. To learn more about the upload options, refer to [Upload videos](/how-to/upload-videos).

## 2. Wait for video processing

Because Stream must download and process the video, the video might not be available for a few seconds depending on the length of your video.

Refer to [Use webhooks for notifications](/how-to/use-webhooks) to learn how to create a webhook subscription and receive notifications when a video on your account finishes processing.

## 3. Stream the video

Now that your video is ready to stream, refer to [View videos](/how-to/view-videos) to choose an option for viewing your videos.
