Cloudflare Stream is a video-on-demand platform for developers and content teams building video applications. With Stream, it's one easy API call to upload a video and get an embedable video.

In the background, Cloudflare encodes, stores and delivers your videos. Cloudflare takes care of optimizing the right format and bitrate for every device and network connection.
