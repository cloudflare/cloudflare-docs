We use to few different adaptive streaming levels from 360p to 1080p to ensure smooth streaming for your audience watching on different devices and bandwidth constraints.

## Can I download original video files from Stream?

## Is there a limit to the amount of videos I can upload?

Each account starts with a 500 GB weekly rolling upload limit, which means that videos uploaded in the past 7 days regardless of the day of week will be counted. This only includes original videos uploaded.

A video file can be at most 20 GB. Please write to Cloudflare support or your customer success contact for higher limits.

## What frame rates (FPS) are supported?

Cloudflare Stream supports video file uploads for any FPS, however videos will be re-encoded for 30 FPS playback. If the original video file has a frame rate lower than 30 FPS, we will re-encode at the original frame rate.

If the frame rate is variable we will drop frames (e.g. if there are more than 1 frames within 1/30 seconds, we will drop the extra frames within that period).
