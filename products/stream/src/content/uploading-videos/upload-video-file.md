# Upload video file

## Basic Uploads (for small videos)

For files smaller than 200MB you can use simple form based uploads. This is an easy way to upload but does not support resumable uploading.

Make an HTTP request with content-type header set to `multipart/form-data` and include the media as an input with the name set to `file`.

### cURL example

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-F file=@/Users/kyle/Desktop/video.mp4 \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT/stream
```

<Aside>

Note that cURL `-F` flag automatically configures the content-type header and maps `skiing.mp4` to a form input called `file`.

</Aside>

## Resumable uploads with tus (for large files)

### What is tus?

> tus is a protocol based on HTTP for resumable file uploads. Resumable means that an upload can be interrupted at any moment and can be resumed without re-uploading the previous data again. An interruption may happen willingly, if the user wants to pause, or by accident in case of an network issue or server outage.

[tus protocol](https://tus.io) is the recommended method for uploading large files to Cloudflare Stream from a computer. Popular programming languages have [tus client implementations](https://tus.io/implementations.html).

<Aside>

Important: Cloudflare Stream requires a minimum chunk size of 5,242,880 bytes when using TUS, unless the entire file is less than this amount.

We recommend increasing the chunk size to 52,428,800 bytes for better performance when the client connection is expected to be reliable.

</Aside>

### Specifying upload options

The tus protocol allows you to add optional parameters [in the `Upload-Metadata` header](https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#upload-metadata).

### Supported options in "Upload-Metadata"

<Definitions>

- `requiresignedurls`

  - If this key is present, the video playback for this video will be required to use signed urls after upload.

- `allowedorigins`

  - A comma separated strings containing the domains. This will set the [allowed origins setting](/viewing-your-videos/securing-your-stream) for the video.

- `thumbnailtimestamppct`

  - Specify the default thumbnail [timestamp percentage](/viewing-videos/displaying-thumbnails). Note that percentage is a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0.

- `watermark`

  - The watermark profile UID.

</Definitions>

### Command-line example

<Example>

You will also need to download a tus client. This tutorial will use the [tus python client](https://github.com/tus/tus-py-client), available through pip, pythons's package manager.

```bash
pip install -U tus.py
```

```bash
tus-upload --chunk-size 5242880 --header Authorization "Bearer $TOKEN" $PATH_TO_VIDEO https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT/stream
```

In the beginning of the response from tus, youâ€™ll see the endpoint for getting information about your newly uploaded video.

    INFO Creating file endpoint
    INFO Created: https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/d467d4f0fcbcd9791b613bc3a9599cdc/stream/dd5d531a12de0c724bd1275a3b2bc9c6
    ...

</Example>


### Golang Example

<Example>

To get started, import a [tus](https://tus.io) client. You can use the [go-tus](https://github.com/eventials/go-tus) by [eventials](https://github.com/eventials) to upload from your Go applications.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"os"

	tus "github.com/eventials/go-tus"
)

func main() {
	accountID := "ACCOUNT ID"

	f, err := os.Open("videofile.mp4")

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	defer f.Close()

	headers := make(http.Header)
	headers.Add("Authorization", "Bearer $TOKEN")

	config := &tus.Config{
		ChunkSize:           5 * 1024 * 1024, // Cloudflare Stream requires a minimum chunk size of 5MB.
		Resume:              false,
		OverridePatchMethod: false,
		Store:               nil,
		Header:              headers,
		HttpClient:          nil,
	}

	client, _ := tus.NewClient("https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/"+ accountID +"/stream", config)

	upload, _ := tus.NewUploadFromFile(f)

	uploader, _ := client.CreateUpload(upload)

	uploader.Upload()
}

```

You can also get the progress of the upload if you're running the upload in a goroutine.

```go
// returns the progress percentage.
upload.Progress()

// returns whether or not the upload is complete.
upload.Finished()
```

</Example>

Please see [go-tus](https://github.com/eventials/go-tus) on GitHub for functionality such as resuming uploads and getting more details about the progress of the upload.


### Node.js Example

<Example>

Install tus-js-client

```bash
npm install tus-js-client
```

Set up an index.js and configure:

* API endpoint with your Cloudflare Account ID
* Request headers to include a API token

```javascript
var fs = require("fs");
var tus = require("tus-js-client");

// specify location of file you'd like to upload below
var path = __dirname + "/test.mp4";
var file = fs.createReadStream(path);
var size = fs.statSync(path).size;

var options = {
  endpoint: "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT ID}/stream",
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer $TOKEN',
  },
  chunkSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024, // Cloudflare Stream requires a minimum chunk size of 5MB.
  resume: true,
  metadata: {
    filename: "test.mp4",
    filetype: "video/mp4",
    defaulttimestamppct: 0.5,
    watermark: "$WATERMARKUID"
  },
  uploadSize: size,
  onError: function (error) {
    throw error;
  },
  onProgress: function (bytesUploaded, bytesTotal) {
    var percentage = (bytesUploaded / bytesTotal * 100).toFixed(2);
    console.log(bytesUploaded, bytesTotal, percentage + "%");
  },
  onSuccess: function () {
    console.log("Upload finished:", upload.url);
    var index = upload.url.lastIndexOf("/") + 1;
    var mediaId = upload.url.substr(index)
    console.log("Media id:", mediaId);
  }
};

var upload = new tus.Upload(file, options);
upload.start();
```

</Example>
