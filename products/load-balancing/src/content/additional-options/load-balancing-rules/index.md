# Custom rules

Use load balancing rules to customize the behavior of your [load balancer](/understand-basics/load-balancers). For example, create a rule that selects an [origin pool](/understand-basics/pools) based on the URI path of an HTTP request.

## More details

You can [create Load Balancing rules](create-rules) whenever you create or edit a load balancer in **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.

As with Cloudflare [Firewall rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-firewall-rules), each Load Balancing rule is a combination of two elements: an [expression](expressions) and an [action](actions). Expressions define the criteria for an HTTP request to trigger an action. The action tells Cloudflare how to handle the request.

When building expressions for Load Balancing rules, refer to [Supported fields and operators](reference) for definitions and usage.

## Availability

By default, non-Enterprise customers have **one** Load Balancing rule **per domain**. For more rules, upgrade to [Enterprise](https://www.cloudflare.com/enterprise/).

## Limitations

At the moment, you cannot use load balancing rules with [Cloudflare Spectrum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/about/load-balancer).
