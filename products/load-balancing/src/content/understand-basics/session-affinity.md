# Session affinity

When you enable session affinity, your load balancer directs all requests from a particular end user to a specific origin server. This continuity preserves information about the user session — such as items in their shopping cart — that might otherwise be lost if requests were spread out among multiple servers.

Session affinity can also help reduce network requests, leading to savings for customers with usage-based billing.

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

Cloudflare only supports cookie-based session affinity. Other methods, such as TCP session affinity, are not supported.

## Process

Session Affinity automatically directs requests from the same client to the same origin web server:

- **When a client makes its first request**, Cloudflare sets a `CFLib` cookie on the client that tracks the associated origin web server.
- **Subsequent requests by the same client are forwarded to that origin** for the duration of the cookie and as long as the origin server remains healthy.
- **If the cookie expires or the origin server is unhealthy**, Cloudflare sets a new cookie tracking the new failover origin.

All sessions default to 23 hours unless you set a custom session *Time to live* (TTL).

The session cookie is secure when [Always Use HTTPS](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/204144518#h_a61bfdef-08dd-40f8-8888-7edd8e40d156) is enabled. Additionally, HttpOnly is always enabled for the cookie to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

## Enabling Session Affinity from the Cloudflare dashboard

Enable Session Affinity when you [create  or edit a load balancer](/create-load-balancer-ui), during the **Hostname** step.

If you enable Session Affinity, choose one of the following options:
- **By Cloudflare cookie only**: Sets a `CFLib` cookie to track the associated origin web server
- **By Cloudflare cookie and Client IP fallback**: Sets a `CFLib` cookie, but also uses the client IP address when no session affinity cookie is provided

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

Session Affinity with Client IP fallback is not supported for load balancers in [DNS-only mode (gray cloud)](/understand-basics/proxy-modes).

### Origin Drain

Drain or remove all traffic from an origin without affecting any active customers using Origin Drain. For more details on origin drain, refer to [Performing planned maintenance](/additional-options/planned-maintenance#gradual-rotation).

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

Origin drain is not supported for load balancers in [DNS-only mode (gray cloud)](/understand-basics/proxy-modes).

## Enabling Session Affinity via the Cloudflare API

Session affinity is a property of load balancers, which you can set with the following endpoints:

- [Create a load balancer](https://api.cloudflare.com/#load-balancers-create-load-balancer)
- [Edit a load balancer](https://api.cloudflare.com/#load-balancers-update-load-balancer)

Customize the behavior of session affinity by using the `session_affinity`, `session_affinity_ttl`, and `session_affinity_attributes` parameters.

For more details on API commands in context, refer to [Create a load balancer with the API](/create-load-balancer-api/).
