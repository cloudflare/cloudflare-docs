# Cloudflare Load Balancing

Cloudflare Load Balancing allows you to distribute traffic across your servers, which reduces server strain and latency and improves the experience for end users.

## Benefits

Cloudflare Load Balancing provides several benefits:

- **Load balancing and failover**: Distribute traffic evenly across your healthy servers, automatically failing over when a server is unhealthy or unresponsive.
- **Active health checks**: Monitor your servers at configurable intervals and across multiple data centers to look for specific status codes, response text, and timeouts.
- **Intelligent routing**: Choose whether to distribute requests based on server latency, a visitor's geographic region, or even a visitor's GPS coordinates.
- **Customized setup**: Create custom rules (or reuse monitors and pools across multiple load balancers) to adjust routing according to the characteristics of each request.

## Availability

Cloudflare Load Balancing is available as an add-on feature for any type of account. The exact number of load balancers, origin servers, and monitors depend on your plan type.
