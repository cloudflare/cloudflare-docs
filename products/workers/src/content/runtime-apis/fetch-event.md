# FetchEvent

## Background

The event type for HTTP requests dispatched to a Worker.

The `Object` passed through as `event` in [`addEventListener()`](/runtime-apis/add-event-listener).

## Context

```js
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event))
})
```

### Properties

<Definitions>

- `event.type` <Type>string</Type>
    - The type of event.

- `event.request` <TypeLink href="/runtime-apis/request">Request</TypeLink>
    - The incoming HTTP request triggering `FetchEvent`.

</Definitions>

### Methods

When a Workers script receives a request, the Workers runtime triggers a FetchEvent which may then be handled by any event listeners registered for the type `"fetch"`. The event handler can invoke any of the following methods of the `event` object to control what happens next:

<Definitions>

-  <Code>event.respondWith(response<TypeLink href="/runtime-apis/request">Request</TypeLink>|<span style={{marginLeft:"-6px"}}><ParamType>Promise</ParamType></span>)</Code> <Type>void</Type>

    - Intercept the request and send a custom response. _If no event handler calls `respondWith()` the runtime attempts to request the origin as if no Worker script exists. If no origin is setup (e.g. workers.dev sites), then the Workers script must call `respondWith()` for a valid response._

- <Code>event.passThroughOnException()</Code> <Type>void</Type>

    - Prevents requests from failing due to an unhandled exception thrown by the Worker, causing it instead to [“fail open”](https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Security-Blog/Security-Fundamentals-Part-1-Fail-Open-vs-Fail-Closed/ba-p/283747). Instead of returning an error response, the runtime will proxy the request to the origin server as though the Worker was never invoked.

- <Code>event.waitUntil(promise<ParamType>Promise</ParamType>)</Code> <Type>void</Type>

    - Extend the lifetime of the event without blocking the `response` from being sent. Use this method to notify the runtime to wait for tasks (e.g. logging, analytics to third-party services, streaming and caching) that need to run longer than the usual time it takes to send a response.
