# Headers

## Background

All HTTP request and response headers are available through the [Headers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers).

When a header name possesses multiple values, those values will be concatenated as a single, comma-delimited string value. This means that `Headers.get` will always return a string or a `null` value. This applies to all header names except for `Set-Cookie`, which requires `Headers.getAll`. This is documented below in Differences. 

```js
let headers = new Headers;

headers.get('x-foo'); //=> null

headers.set('x-foo', '123');
headers.get('x-foo'); //=> "123"

headers.set('x-foo', 'hello');
headers.get('x-foo'); //=> "hello"

headers.append('x-foo', 'world');
headers.get('x-foo'); //=> "hello, world"
```

## Differences

* Despite the fact that the `Headers.getAll` method has been made obsolete, Cloudflare still offers this method but only for use with the `Set-Cookie` header. This is because cookies will often contain date strings, which include commas. This can make parsing multiple values in a `Set-Cookie` header more difficult. Any attempts to use `Headers.getAll` with other header names will throw an error. A brief history `Headers.getAll` is available in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/973). 

* In Cloudflare Workers, the `Headers.get` method returns a [`USVString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USVString) instead of a [`ByteString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ByteString), which is specified by the spec. For most scenarios, this should have no noticeable effect. To compare the differences between these two string classes, please refer to this [Playground example](https://cloudflareworkers.com/#97c644202d0ef43fd73acb6b045529e8:https://tutorial.cloudflareworkers.com).
