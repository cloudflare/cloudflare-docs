# Headers

## Background

All HTTP request and response headers are available through the [Headers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers).

When a header name possesses multiple values, those values will be concatenated as a single, comma-delimited string value. This means that `Headers.get` will always return a string or a `null` value. This applies to all header names except for `Set-Cookie`, which requires `Headers.getAll`. This is documented below in [Differences](#differences). 

```js
let headers = new Headers;

headers.get('x-foo'); //=> null

headers.set('x-foo', '123');
headers.get('x-foo'); //=> "123"

headers.set('x-foo', 'hello');
headers.get('x-foo'); //=> "hello"

headers.append('x-foo', 'world');
headers.get('x-foo'); //=> "hello, world"
```

## Differences

* Despite the fact that the `Headers.getAll` method has been made obsolete, Cloudflare still offers this method but only for use with the `Set-Cookie` header. This is because cookies will often contain date strings, which include commas. This can make parsing multiple values in a `Set-Cookie` header more difficult. Any attempts to use `Headers.getAll` with other header names will throw an error. A brief history `Headers.getAll` is available in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/973). 

* In Cloudflare Workers, the `Headers.get` method returns a [`USVString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/USVString) instead of a [`ByteString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ByteString), which is specified by the spec. For most scenarios, this should have no noticeable effect. To compare the differences between these two string classes, please refer to this [Playground example](https://cloudflareworkers.com/#97c644202d0ef43fd73acb6b045529e8:https://tutorial.cloudflareworkers.com).

## Cloudflare headers

Cloudflare sets a number of its own custom headers on incoming requests and outgoing responses. While some may be used for its own tracking and bookkeeping, many of these can be useful to your own applications – or Workers – too.

### Request headers

* `CF-Connecting-IP`: In same-zone Worker subrequests, the value of `CF-Connecting-IP` reflects the value of `x-real-ip` (the client’s IP). `x-real-ip` can be altered by the user in their Worker script.

    In cross-zone subrequests from one Cloudflare customer zone to another Cloudflare customer zone, the `CF-Connecting-IP` value will be set to the Worker client IP address `'2a06:98c0:3600::103'` for security reasons. 

    For Worker subrequests destined for a non-Cloudflare customer zone, the `CF-Connecting-IP` and `x-real-ip` headers will both reflect the client's IP address, with only the `x-real-ip` header able to be altered.

    When no Worker subrequest is triggered, `cf-connecting-ip` reflects the client's IP address and the `x-real-ip` header is stripped.

* `CF-Worker`: Added to all Worker subrequests sent via `fetch()`. Set to the name of the zone which owns the Worker making the subrequest. For example, a Worker script on route for `foo.example.com/*` from `example.com` will have all subrequests with the header:

    `CF-Worker`: `example.com`

    The intended purpose of this header is to provide a means for recipients (e.g., origins, load balancers, other Workers) to recognize, filter, and route traffic generated by Workers on specific zones.

    <Aside type="note">

    When configuring Cloudflare Firewall Rules, do not match on this header. Firewall Rules are applied before Cloudflare adds the `CF-Worker` header. Instead, use the `cf.worker.upstream_zone`(https://tinyurl.com/2wx4senh) dynamic field, which contains the same value and exists for the same purpose.

    </Aside>

* `CF-EW-Via`: Used for loop detection, similar to the `CDN-Loop` [header](https://blog.cloudflare.com/preventing-request-loops-using-cdn-loop/).
