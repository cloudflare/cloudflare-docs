# Getting started

Cloudflare Workers is a **serverless application platform** running on Cloudflare‚Äôs global cloud network in over 200 cities around the world, offering both [free and paid plans](/platform/pricing).

Learn more about [how Workers works](/learning/how-workers-works).

<Aside header="Try the Playground">

The quickest way to experiment with Cloudflare Workers is in the [Playground](https://cloudflareworkers.com/#36ebe026bf3510a2e5acace89c09829f:about:blank). It doesn‚Äôt require _any_ setup. It‚Äôs just a simple, instant way to preview and test a Workers script directly in the browser against any site.

</Aside>

--------------------------------

## 1. Sign up for a Workers account

Before you can start [publishing](/cli-wrangler/commands#publish) your Workers on your own domain or a free workers.dev subdomain, you‚Äôll need to sign up for a Cloudflare Workers account.

<p><Button type="primary" href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers">Sign up</Button></p>

The signup process will guide you through choosing a workers.dev subdomain and verifying your email address, both of which are required to publish.

--------------------------------

## 2. Install the Workers CLI

Installing `wrangler`, the Workers CLI, gives you the freedom to [generate](/cli-wrangler/commands#generate), [configure](/cli-wrangler/commands#configure), [build](/cli-wrangler/commands#build), [preview](/cli-wrangler/commands#preview), and [publish](/cli-wrangler/commands#publish) your Workers projects from the comfort of your dev environment.

To install [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler), ensure you have [`npm` installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then run:

```sh
$ npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

Then run `wrangler --version` to confirm that the installation was successful:

```sh
$ wrangler --version
üë∑ ‚ú®  wrangler 1.12.2
```

--------------------------------

## 3. Configure the Workers CLI

Now that Wrangler is installed, you'll need to give it an API Token for your Cloudflare account.

Run the command `wrangler login` and Wrangler will ask to automatically open your web browser to log into your Cloudflare account. If you are in an environment that doesn't have a GUI, you can copy and paste the url into a browser and log in.

```bash
$ wrangler login
Allow Wrangler to open a page in your browser? [y/n]
y
üíÅ  Opened a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/wrangler?key=girjeanvioajsdn...
```

Open the browser, log into your account, and click the `Authorize Wrangler` button. This will send an API Token to Wrangler so it can deploy your scripts to Cloudflare.

--------------------------------

## 4. Generate a new project

Wrangler‚Äôs [`generate` subcommand](/cli-wrangler/commands#generate) will create a new project from a ‚Äústarter‚Äù template‚Äîjust a GitHub repo. With no [template argument](/cli-wrangler/commands#generate), Wrangler generates projects from the [default starter](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template). Let‚Äôs generate a new project, called `my-worker`:

```sh
~/ $ wrangler generate my-worker
```

Wrangler will create a directory called `my-worker` and populate it with the contents of the starter template, in this case the default, and will automatically configure the `wrangler.toml` file in the project‚Äôs root with the `name = "my-worker"`.

```sh
~/ $ cd my-worker
~/my-worker $ ls
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md LICENSE_MIT        index.js           wrangler.toml
LICENSE_APACHE     README.md          package.json

~/my-worker $ cat wrangler.toml
name = "my-worker"
type = "javascript"
account_id = ""
workers_dev = true
route = ""
zone_id = ""
```

Visit the [Starters](/starters) page to see a complete list of our recommended starter templates.

For example, to build a Workers project in TypeScript, you would instead run:

```sh
~/ $ wrangler generate my-typescript-worker https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/worker-typescript-template
```

To start a project from your own code‚Äîrather than a starter‚Äîuse [`wrangler init`](/cli-wrangler/commands#init).

--------------------------------

## 5. Write code

With your new project generated, you‚Äôre ready to write your own code.

### 5a. Understanding Hello World

At its heart, a Workers app consists of two parts:

1. An [event listener](/runtime-apis/add-event-listener) that listens for [`FetchEvents`](/runtime-apis/fetch-event), and
2. An event handler that returns a [Response](/runtime-apis/response) object which is passed to the event‚Äôs `.respondWith()` method.

When a request is received on one of Cloudflare‚Äôs edge servers for a URL matching a Workers script, it passes the request in to the Workers runtime, which in turn [emits a ‚Äúfetch‚Äù](/learning/fetch-event-lifecycle) event in the [isolate](/learning/how-workers-works#isolates) where the script is running.

```js
---
filename: ~/my-worker/index.js
---
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response("Hello worker!", {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" }
  })
}
```

Let‚Äôs break this down:

1. An event listener for the `FetchEvent` tells the script to listen for any request coming to your Worker. The event handler is passed the `event` object, which includes `event.request`, a [`Request`](/runtime-apis/request) object which is a representation of the HTTP request that triggered the FetchEvent.

2. The call to [`.respondWith()`](/runtime-apis/fetch-event#methods) lets us intercept the request in order send back a custom response (in this case, the plain text ‚ÄúHello worker!‚Äù).

    - The `FetchEvent` handler typically culminates in a call to the method `.respondWith()` with either a [`Response`](/runtime-apis/response) or `Promise<Response>` that determines the response.

    - The `FetchEvent` object also provides [two other methods](/runtime-apis/fetch-event#methods) to handle unexpected exceptions and operations that may complete after a response is returned.

Learn more about [the `FetchEvent` lifecycle](/learning/fetch-event-lifecycle).

### 5b. Routing and filtering requests

Now that we have a very basic script running on all requests, the next thing you‚Äôll commonly want to be able to do is generate a dynamic response based on the requests the Worker script is receiving. This is often referred to as routing or filtering.

#### Option 1: Manually filter requests

You can use standard JavaScript branching logic, such as `if`/`else` or `switch` statements, to conditionally return different responses or execute different handlers based on the request:

```js
---
filename: ~/my-worker/index.js
highlight: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
---
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  let response
  if (request.method === "POST") {
    response = await generate(request)
  } else {
    response = new Response("Expected POST", { status: 500 })
  }
  // ...
}
```

It‚Äôs very common to filter requests based on:

- `request.method` ‚Äî e.g. `GET` or `POST`.
- `request.url` ‚Äî e.g. filter based on query parameters or the pathname.
- `request.headers` ‚Äî filter based on specific headers.

See a list of [all properties of a `Request` object](/runtime-apis/request#properties).

In addition to standard request properties, the Workers platform populates the request with a [`cf` object](/runtime-apis/request#incomingrequestcfproperties), containing many useful properties, e.g. the `region` or `timezone`.

#### Option 2: Use a template for routing on URL

For more complex routing, it can be helpful to use a library. The [Workers router starter](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template-router) template provides an API similar to ExpressJS for handling requests based on HTTP methods and paths:

```sh
~/ $ wrangler generate my-worker-with-router https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template-router
```

This starter is used in the tutorial for [building a Slack Bot](/tutorials/build-a-slackbot).

### 5c. Make use of runtime APIs

The example outlined in this guide is just a starting point. There are many Workers [runtime APIs](/runtime-apis) available to manipulate requests and generate responses. For example, you can use the [HTMLRewriter API](/runtime-apis/html-rewriter) to parse and transform HTML on the fly, use the [Cache API](/runtime-apis/cache) to retrieve data from and put data into [the Cloudflare cache](/learning/how-the-cache-works), compute a custom response right from the edge, redirect the request to another service, and so much more.

For inspiration, visit [Built with Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with) for a showcase of projects.

--------------------------------

## 6. Preview your project

In order to preview our Worker, we're going to need to configure our project by adding our `Account ID` to our project's `wrangler.toml`.

Run the command `wrangler whoami` and copy your `Account ID`.

```bash
$ wrangler whoami
üëã  You are logged in with an API Token, associated with the email '<Your Email>'!

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Account Name                     | Account ID                       |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Your Account                     | $yourAccountId                   |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
```

Then, open up your project's `wrangler.toml` and paste it in as the value for the `account_id` field.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
highlight: [2]
---
name = "my-worker"
account_id = "$yourAccountId"
```

Once you've done that, you‚Äôre ready to preview your code. Run the `wrangler dev` command:

```sh
~/my-worker $ wrangler dev
üíÅ  watching "./"
üëÇ  Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

This command will build your project, run it locally, and return a url for you to visit to preview the worker.

<Aside header="A note about building">

Running `wrangler dev` and `wrangler publish` both run `wrangler build` beforehand automatically, but it can be useful to run `build` separately to check for errors. Running `wrangler build` installs the necessary dependencies for your project and compiles it to make it ready for previewing or deployment. Learn [more about Wrangler](/cli-wrangler/commands).

</Aside>

--------------------------------

## 7. Configure your project for deployment

To configure your project, we need to fill in a few missing fields in the `wrangler.toml` file in the root of the generated project. This file contains the information Wrangler needs to connect to the Cloudflare Workers API and publish your code.

You should have already filled in the `account_id` field in the last step. If you didn't, you can get your `Account ID` by running `wrangler whoami`.

```bash
$ wrangler whoami
üëã  You are logged in with an API Token, associated with the email '<Your Email>'!

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Account Name                     | Account ID                       |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Your Account                     | $yourAccountId                   |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
```

Then, paste it into your `wrangler.toml` as the value for the `account_id` field.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
highlight: [2]
---
name = "my-worker"
account_id = "$yourAccountId"
```

Let‚Äôs also configure the `type` to `"webpack"`, to tell Wrangler to use [Webpack](/cli-wrangler/webpack) to package your project for deployment. (Learn more about [`type` configuration](/cli-wrangler/configuration).)

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
highlight: [3]
---
name = "my-worker"
account_id = "$yourAccountId"
type = "webpack"
```

By default, this project will deploy to your workers.dev subdomain. When deploying to a workers.dev subdomain, the **name** field will be used as the secondary subdomain for the deployed script, e.g. `my-worker.my-subdomain.workers.dev`.

#### (Optional) Configure for deploying to a registered domain

To publish your application on a domain you own, and not a workers.dev subdomain, you can add a `route` key to your `wrangler.toml`.

You can get your `zone_id` with the following steps:

1. [**Log in** to your Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select the desired domain.
2. Select the **Overview** tab on the navigation bar.
3. Scroll down until you see both **Zone ID** on the right.
4. Click **Click to copy** below the input.

Wrangler‚Äôs [environments feature](/platform/environments) allows us to specify multiple different deploy targets for our application. Let's add a `production` environment, passing in a `zone_id` and `route`:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
highlight: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
---
name = "my-worker"
account_id = "$yourAccountId"
type = "webpack"
workers_dev = true

[env.production]
# The ID of the domain to deploying to
zone_id = "$yourZoneId"

# The route pattern your Workers application will be served at
route = "example.com/*"
```

The `route` key here is a [route pattern](/platform/routes), which e.g., can contain wildcards.

If your route is configured to a hostname, you will need to add a DNS record to Cloudflare to ensure that the hostname can be resolved externally. If your Worker acts as your origin (the response comes directly from a Worker), you should enter a placeholder (dummy) AAAA record pointing to `100::`, which is the [reserved IPv6 discard prefix](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6666).

--------------------------------

## 8. Publish your project

With our project configured, it‚Äôs time to publish it.

To deploy to our workers.dev subdomain, we can run:

```sh
---
header: Publish to workers.dev
---
~/my-worker $ wrangler publish
```

<Aside>

__Note:__ When pushing to workers.dev project for the first time, you may initially see **523 errors** while DNS is propagating. It should work after a minute or so.

</Aside>

#### (Optional) Publish your project to a registered domain

To deploy to our production environment we set in our `wrangler.toml` in the optional configuration step, we can pass the `--env` flag to the command:

```sh
---
header: Publish to example.com
---
~/my-worker $ wrangler publish --env production
```

For more information on environments, check out the [Wrangler documentation](/cli-wrangler/configuration#environments).

You can also configure a GitHub repo to automatically deploy every time you `git push`. You can do this by either using the [Workers GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-cloudflare-workers), or by writing your own GitHub action and manually configuring the necessary [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).
