# Cron Triggers

## Background

Cron Triggers allow users to map a cron expression to a Worker script using a [ScheduledEvent](/runtime-apis/scheduled-event) listener that enables Workers to be executed on a schedule. Cron Triggers are ideal for running periodic jobs for maintenance or calling third-party APIs to collect up-to-date data. Workers scheduled by Cron Triggers will run on underutilized machines to make the best use of our capacity and route traffic efficiently.

## Adding Cron Triggers

Cron Triggers can be added to scripts with the Cloudflare API, or in the dashboard on a [Workers Triggers tab](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) up to the [per-script limit](/platform/limits). If a script is managed with Wrangler, Cron Triggers should be exclusively managed through the **`wrangler.toml`** file.

## Supported cron expressions

We support cron expressions with 5 fields, along with most "Quartz scheduler"-like cron syntax extensions:

<TableWrap>

Field         | Values  | Characters
--------------|---------|------------
Minute        | 0-59    | * , - /
Hours         | 0-23    | * , - /
Days of Month | 1-31    | * , - / L W
Months        | 1-12, case-insensitive 3-letter abreviations ("JAN", "aug", etc.) | * , - /
Weekdays      | 1-7, case-insensitive 3-letter abreviations ("MON", "fri", etc.)  | * , - / L #

</TableWrap>

### Examples

Here are some common time intervals that may be useful for setting up your Cron Trigger.

<Definitions>

- `* * * * *`
  - Every minute

- `*/30 * * * *`
  - Every 30 minutes

- `0 17 * * sun` or `0 17 * * 1`
  - 5PM on Sunday

- `10 7 * * mon-fri` or `10 7 * * 2-6`
  - 7:10AM on weekdays

- `0 15 1 * *`
  - 3PM on first day of the month

- `0 18 * * 6L` or `0 18 * * friL`
  - 6PM on the last Friday of the month

- `23 59 LW * *`
  - 11:59PM on the last weekday of the month

</Definitions>

## Viewing past events

Users can view the execution history of their Cron Triggers on the Past Events section of the [Workers Triggers tab](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) or through Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api).

Note: it can take up to 30 minutes before events are displayed in Past Events when creating a new Worker or changing a Worker's name.
