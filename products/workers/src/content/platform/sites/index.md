# Workers Sites

<Aside>

__Note:__ Workers Sites requires the Workers [Bundled plan](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites#plans). As Workers Sites depend on both Workers and Workers KV, their usage is taken into account when calculating your monthly bill.

</Aside>

Workers Sites enables developers to deploy __static applications__ directly to Workers.

It’s perfect for deploying applications built with static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), or frontend frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

To deploy with Workers Sites, select from one of these __three routes__ depending on the state of your target project:

--------------------------------

## 1. Deploy an existing static site

If you have an existing project or static assets that you want to deploy with Workers, this quick start guide will help you add Wrangler and configure Workers Sites for your project.

## 3. Add static assets to an existing Workers project
