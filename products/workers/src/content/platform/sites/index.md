# Workers Sites

<Aside>

__Note:__ Workers Sites requires the Workers [Bundled plan](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites#plans). As Workers Sites depend on both Workers and Workers KV, their usage is taken into account when calculating your monthly bill.

</Aside>

Workers Sites enables developers to deploy __static applications__ directly to Workers.

It’s perfect for deploying applications built with static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), or frontend frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

To deploy with Workers Sites, select from one of these __three routes__ depending on the state of your target project:

--------------------------------

## 1. Deploy an existing static site

If you have an existing project or static assets that you want to deploy with Workers, this quick start guide will help you add Wrangler and configure Workers Sites for your project.

--------------------------------

## 2. Start from scratch

If you’re ready to start a brand new project, starting from scratch with Workers Sites will set up the infrastructure to deploy a simple HTML website to Workers.

## 3. Add static assets to an existing Workers project

If you already have an application deployed to Workers, this guide will show you how to use Workers Sites in your existing codebase, allowing you to deploy your entire application as a single Workers project.
