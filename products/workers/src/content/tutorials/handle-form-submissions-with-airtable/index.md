# Handle form submissions with Airtable

<TutorialsBeforeYouStart/>

## Overview

Cloudflare Workers excels as a performant serverless functions platform. This makes it a great fit for handling form submissions from your front-end applications, particularly when you need to send those submissions to an external API or database.

In this tutorial, we'll use Workers and [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to persist form submissions from a front-end user interface. Airtable is a great, free-to-use spreadsheet solution that has an approachable API for developers. Workers will handle incoming form submissions, and use Airtable's [REST API](https://airtable.com/api) to asynchronously persist the data in an Airtable "base" (Airtable's term for a spreadsheet) for later reference.

[The source for this project can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-airtable-form)—note that this codebase includes both a front-end component (built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)), as well as a serverless function for handling the interaction with Airtable. 

The front-end portion of this site does not require any specific React experience. It uses a basic HTML5 form, showing that you can use Workers to handle any kind of form, whether entirely in HTML, or client-side, JS-heavy forms, such as with React or other front-end frameworks.

## Creating the front-end form

This tutorial won't cover the basics of HTML5 forms. To recap the basics, a `form` element generally contains an `action` attribute, which indicates the URL that the form will submit to. For instance, the below `form` will submit data to the path `/new_submission`:

```html
<form action="/new_submission">
  <input type="text" name="text" id="text"></input>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

<Aside>

If you're unfamiliar with HTML5 forms, the Mozilla Developer Network's ["Web Forms - Working with user data"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) is a great guide to learn from.

</Aside>

To pass data _inside_ of the form, you can use `input` tags. `input` tags have a `type`, which specifies how the `input` should render, and what kind of data it contains. When an `input` has a `name` attribute, the `form` will submit that data to the provided `action` URL, matching that `name` attribute. 

In the above example, if I fill in the `input` field with the text "Hello", submitting the `form` via the "Submit" `button` will submit data to the URL `/new_submission` with the data `text=Hello`.

The `form` used in the example front-end UI builds on these basics, adding some CSS classes via Tailwind CSS, and adding the fields needed for a "Contact"-style form: "First name", "Last name", "Email", "Phone", "Subject", and "Message".

The code for this form can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-airtable-form/blob/main/src/Form.js). Of particular note is the `form` action, which has a placeholder for our serverless function URL, and the `method` attribute, which uses an [HTTP POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) to submit the form. The first `input` is also recreated here, to show that the `name` is set to the value `first_name`.

```html
<form action="SERVERLESS_FN_URL" method="POST" class="...">
  <div>
    <label for="first_name" class="...">
      First name
    </label>
    <div class="...">
      <input
        type="text"
        name="first_name"
        id="first_name"
        autocomplete="given-name"
        placeholder="Ellen"
        required
        class="..."
      />
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Rest of form -->
</form>
```

## Creating the Workers serverless function

In order to handle the form submission, we'll create and deploy a Workers serverless function that parses the incoming form data, and prepares it for submission to Airtable.

To begin, use `wrangler` to generate a new function, called `airtable-form-handler`, and navigate to it in our terminal:

```sh
$ wrangler generate airtable-form-handler
$ cd airtable-form-handler
```

In order to easily parse the form data being sent to our function, we'll install the NPM package [`qs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs):

```sh
$ npm install qs
```

With the `qs` package installed, we need to update our project type to `webpack`, which will tell Wrangler to bundle NPM packages with our serverless function. In `wrangler.toml`, update the `type` attribute. While we're here, you can also add your Cloudflare account ID.

<Aside>

Unsure where to find your account ID? [Check out our Quick Start guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide#7-configure-your-project-for-deployment) to find your account ID.

</Aside>

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
highlight: [2, 4]
---
name = "airtable-form-handler"
type = "webpack"

account_id = "yourAccountId"
```

## Configuring an Airtable base

When our serverless function is completed, it will send data up to an Airtable base via Airtable's REST API.

If you don't have an Airtable account, create one (the free plan is fine). In Airtable's dashboard, create a new base, choosing to "Start from scratch":

![Create a new base](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_iWJPoDJUT5.png)

Once you've created a new base, you can set it up for use with the front-end form. Delete the existing columns, and create six columns, with the following "field types":

- _First Name:_ Single line text
- _Last Name:_ Single line text
- _Email:_ Email
- _Phone Number_ Phone number
- _Subject:_ Single line text
- _Message:_ Long text

![Airtable Columns](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_it8wEjbj9i.png)

Finally, give your base's _table_ a name. Right-click the table name at the top left of the screen (it will likely have a name like "Table 1"), and give it a more descriptive name, like "Form Submissions".

![Form submissions](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_CQspQXWJJ8.png)

With our new Airtable base set up, we can grab the values from Airtable's UI that we need to make API requests.

Visit [Airtable's API page](https://airtable.com/api), and select your new base. In the API documentation page, find your **Airtable base ID** (the highlighted text in the below screenshot). You can also check the "show API key" checkbox in the top right of the window, to easily access your Airtable API key from the same page.

![API Details](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_dOrOpIyHyT.png)

Further down the screen, find the authentication section. This will contain an example request showing you how to authenticate with the Airtable API externally, by providing an `Authorization` header in the format `Bearer $API_KEY`. The key after `Bearer` is your Airtable API key—make sure to keep it a secret!

![API Key](https://kmf.lol/2021/06/chrome_pyGBsag0zs.png)

Before we continue, let's review the keys that we should have from Airtable:

1. _Airtable Table Name:_ the name for your table, e.g. "Form Submissions".
2. _Airtable Base ID:_ The alphanumeric base ID found at the top of your base's API page.
3. _Airtable API Key:_ The private API key found in example API requests on the Airtable API documentation page.

## Submitting data to Airtable from Workers

With our Airtable base set up, and the keys and IDs we need to communicate with the API at the ready, it's time to set up our Workers function, and persist data from our form into Airtable.

In `index.js`, begin by setting up a simple Workers handler that can respond to requests. When the URL requested has a pathname of `/submit`, we'll handle a new form submission, otherwise, we'll redirect to `FORM_URL`, a constant representing your front-end form URL (for example, [workers-airtable-form.pages.dev](https://workers-airtable-form.pages.dev/)):

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
import qs from 'qs'

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

const FORM_URL = "https://workers-airtable-form.pages.dev"

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)

  if (url.pathname === "/submit") {
    return submitHandler(request)
  }

  return new Response.redirect(FORM_URL)
}
```

The `submitHandler` has two functions—first, it will parse the form data coming from our HTML5 form, using the `qs` library. Once the data is parsed, we'll use the Airtable API to persist a new _row_ (a new form submission) to our table:

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
const submitHandler = async request => {
  if (request.method !== "POST") {
    return new Response("Method Not Allowed", {
      status: 405
    })
  }

  const body = await request.text()

  const {
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    phone,
    subject,
    message
  } = qs.parse(body)

  const reqBody = {
    fields: {
      "First Name": first_name,
      "Last Name": last_name,
      "Email": email,
      "Phone Number": phone,
      "Subject": subject,
      "Message": message
    }
  }

  await createAirtableRecord(reqBody)
  return Response.redirect(FORM_URL)
}
```

While the majority of this function is concerned with parsing the request _body_ (the data being sent as part of the request), there are two important things to note. First, if the HTTP method sent to this function _isn't_ `POST`, we'll return a new response with the status code of [`405 Method Not Allowed`](https://httpstatuses.com/405). After we call `createAirtableRecord` (the function we'll define next), we'll redirect the client back to our `FORM_URL`. This function can be changed: for instance, to redirect to a "Thank You" page, or something similar.

The `createAirtableRecord` function accepts a `reqBody` parameter, which represents a JavaScript object conforming to the Airtable API's required format:

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
const createAirtableRecord = body => {
  return fetch(`https://api.airtable.com/v0/${AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/${encodeURIComponent(AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME)}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(body),
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-type': `application/json`
    }
  })
}
```

This function contains three values that we haven't defined yet—constants that represent the keys and IDs we need to make valid, authenticated requests to Airtable. 

To set these, we need to configure two types of _environment variables_ inside of our serverless function. For any variables that should remain private, we'll use Wrangler's `secret` command, which can encrypt and store environment variables for use in your function, without revealing them to users. Run `wrangler secret put`, passing `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` as the name of your secret:

```sh
$ wrangler secret put AIRTABLE_API_KEY
Enter the secret text you would like assigned to the variable AIRTABLE_API_KEY on the script named airtable-form-handler:
******
🌀  Creating the secret for script name airtable-form-handler
✨  Success! Uploaded secret AIRTABLE_API_KEY.
```

For values that are acceptable to be public, such as our _Airtable base ID_ and _table name_, we can use Wrangler's `vars` feature to pass environment variables from `wrangler.toml`. Add a `vars` object at the end of your `wrangler.toml` file, as seen below:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
highlight: [7]
---
name = "workers-airtable-form"
type = "webpack"

account_id = "yourAccountId"
workers_dev = true

vars = { AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = "exampleBaseId", AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME = "Form Submissions" }
```

With all these fields submitted, it's time to deploy your Workers serverless function, and get your form communicating with it. First, publish your function:

```sh
$ wrangler publish
✨  Built successfully, built project size is 10 KiB.
✨  Successfully published your script to
 https://workers-airtable-form.signalnerve.workers.dev
```

You'll notice that your function is deployed to a unique URL—for instance, `https://workers-airtable-form.signalnerve.workers.dev`. This represents the first part of your front-end form's `action` attribute—the second part is the _path_ for our form handler, which is `/submit`. In your front-end UI, configure your `form` tag as seen below:

```html
<form action="https://workers-airtable-form.signalnerve.workers.dev/submit" method="POST" class="...">
<!-- The rest of your HTML form -->
```

Once you've deployed your new form (we recommend [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev) for that), you should be able to submit a new form submission, and see the value show up immediately in Airtable:

## Conclusion

With that, you've created a Workers serverless function that can accept form submissions, and persist them to Airtable. Along the way, we've learned how to parse form data, set up environment variables, and use the `fetch` API to make requests to external services outside of our Workers function.

You can find the source for this project—both the front-end UI, as well as the serverless function that communicates with Airtable—[on GitHub](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-airtable-form).
