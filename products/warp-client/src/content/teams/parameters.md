## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I don't supply a Gateway DoH subdomain?
A DoH subdomain value is only required if you configure DNS Filtering.

### How do I obtain logs in the event of an issue with client?
The macOS and Windows clients installations each contain an application in their installed folders called warp-diag that can be used to obtain logs.
