# Teams deployment

## Getting started
Deploying the Cloudflare WARP Client to support your Cloudflare for Teams configuration supports manual installs, simple deployment scripts, or advanced enterprise management tools, such as Microsoft Intune or Jamf.

### If you already have Cloudflare for Teams configured
Already have Cloudflare for Teams configured and want to dive right in? Before you start, make sure you have:
* Configured a device Access Policy to allow devices to authenticate against your organization.
* [Obtained your Gateway DoH subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/gateway/getting-started/configuring-clients/browser/#1-find-your-locations-unique-id) (if using DNS Filtering).
* [Obtained your Cloudflare for Teams auth domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/access/glossary#auth-domain).

Once you have completed these steps, read the instructions included in this section, based on the client you would like to deploy.
