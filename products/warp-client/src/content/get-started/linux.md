# Linux desktop client

You have two ways of installing WARP on Linux, depending on the distro you are using:

1. Find the [setup repository](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/).
1. Install the `cloudflare-warp` package that suits your distro:
    1. **apt-based OS** (like Ubuntu): `sudo apt install cloudflare-warp`.
    2. **yum-based OS** (like CentOS or RHEL): `sudo yum install cloudflare-warp`.

## Using WARP

The command line interface is the primary way to use WARP.

### Initial Connection

To connect for the very first time you must call `register` first:

1. Register the client `warp-cli register`.
1. Connect `warp-cli connect`.
1. Run `curl https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace/` and verify that `warp=on`.

### Always stay connected

If you want to always stay connected to WARP you must call `enable-always-on`. This is the `cli` equivalent to switching the toggle switch to the `on` position in our GUI apps. 

To enable this feature, run: 

```sh
$ warp-cli enable-always-on
```

### Switching modes

You can use `warp-cli set-mode --help` to get a list of the modes to switch between. For instance:

- **DNS only mode via DoH:** `warp-cli set-mode doh`.
- **WARP with DoH:** `warp-cli set-mode warp+doh`.

### Using 1.1.1.1 for Families

The Linux client supports all 1.1.1.1 for Families modes, in either WARP on DNS-only mode:

- **Families mode off:** `warp-cli set-families-mode off`
- **Malware protection:** `warp-cli set-families-mode malware`
- **Malware and adult content:** `warp-cli set-families-mode full`

### Additional commands
A complete list of all supported commands can be found by running:

```sh
$ warp-cli --help
```

## Feedback
You can find logs required to debug WARP issues by running `sudo warp-diag`. This will place a `warp-debugging-info.zip` file in the path from which you ran the command.

To report bugs or provide feedback to the team use the command `sudo warp-diag feedback`. This will submit a support ticket.
