# Cloudflare Spectrum

Spectrum provides security and acceleration for any [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) or [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) based application. That means you can route MQTT, email, file transfer, version control, games, and more over TCP or UDP through Cloudflare to mask the origin and protect it from [DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/). 

Spectrum is available on all paid plans. Pro and Business support selected protocols only, and Enterprise supports all TCP and UDP based traffic. For information on how billing is calculated, refer to [Billing for Spectrum](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360041721872) for an in-depth breakdown.
