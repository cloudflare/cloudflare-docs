# Enable Sumo Logic


Cloudflare can send logs to a Hosted Collector with "HTTP Logs & Metrics" as the source. Once you've set up a collector, you simply provide the HTTP Source Address (a unique URL) to which logs can be posted.

To enable Logpush to Sumo Logic:

1. Configure a Hosted Collector. *See [instructions from Sumo Logic](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors/Configure-a-Hosted-Collector)*.

2. Configure an HTTP Logs & Metrics Source. *See [instructions from Sumo Logic](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source)*. The last step indicates how to get the HTTP Source Address (URL).

3. Provide the HTTP Source Address (URL) when prompted by the Logpush API or UI.

Logpush will stop working if you regenerate the HTTP Source Address (URL). *See [generate a new URL for an HTTP Source from Sumo Logic](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source/zGenerate-a-new-URL-for-an-HTTP-Source)*. To use the new URL, you will have to get a new ownership challenge and update the destination for your job.

Sumo Logic may impose throttling and caps on your log ingestion to prevent your account from using "On-Demand Capacity." *See [manage ingestion](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Ingestion-and-Volume/01Manage-Ingestion)*.
