# Cloudflare Logs documentation

Cloudflare Enterprise customers have access to detailed logs of HTTP requests or Spectrum events. These logs are helpful for debugging, identifying configuration adjustments, and creating analytics, especially when combined with logs from other sources, such as your application server.

You can have your request or event logs pushed to your cloud service provider using the **Logpush service**, which can be configured via the Cloudflare dashboard or an API.

If you're interested in logs of HTTP requests only, you can also download them using the **Logpull API**. The data from **Logpull** and **Logpush** is exactly the same.  As such, you're free to choose the method thatâ€™s most convenient.

Note that by default, Cloudflare does not retain your HTTP request logs. If you're a Spectrum customer, logs of Spectrum events are retained automatically.
