# Get started
Before enabling Logpush, ensure you [grant Cloudflare access](/get-started/enable-destinations/) to push to your storage service, SIEM, or log management provider.

Once you set up the connection between your destination and Cloudflare, configure Logpush using the [Cloudflare UI (Dashboard)](/get-started/logpush-dashboard/) or [API](/get-started/logpush-configuration-api/).

If enabling via the API, you can push to the following storage services:
- [AWS S3](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/aws-s3/)
- [S3-compatible endpoints](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/s3-compatible-endpoints)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/google-cloud-storage/)
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/azure/)

You also can push to the following SIEMs and log management providers:
- [Datadog](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/datadog)
- [Splunk](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/splunk)
- [Sumo Logic](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/sumo-logic/)
