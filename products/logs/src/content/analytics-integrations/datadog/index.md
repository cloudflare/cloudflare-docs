# Datadog

This tutorial explains how to analyze Cloudflare metrics using the [Cloudflare Integration tile for Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/cloudflare/).

## Overview

Before viewing the Cloudflare dashboard in Datadog, note that this integration:

- Is available to all Cloudflare customer plans (Free, Pro, Business and Enterprise)
- Is based on the [Cloudflare Analytics API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-analytics-dashboard)
- Provides Cloudflare web traffic and DNS metrics only
- Does not feature data coming from request logs stored in Cloudflare Logs

## Task 1 - Install the Cloudflare App

To install the Cloudflare App for Datadog:

1. Log in to **Datadog**.

2. Click the **Integrations** tab.

3. In the **search box**, start typing _Cloudflare_. The app tile should appear below the search box.

4. Click the **Cloudflare** tile to begin the installation.

5. Next, click **Configuration** and then complete the following:

   - **Account name**: (Optional) This can be any value. It has not impact on the site data pulled from Cloudflare.

   - **Email**: This value helps keep your account safe. We recommend creating a dedicated Cloudflare user for analytics with the [_Analytics_ role](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/205065067#12345682) (read-only). Note that the _Analytics_ role is available to Enterprise customers only.

   - **API Key**: Enter your Cloudflare Global API key.

6. Click **Install Integration**.

The Cloudflare App for Datadog should be installed now and you can view the dashboard.

## Task 2 - View the dashboard

By default, the dashboard displays metrics for all sites in your Cloudflare account. Use the dashboard filters see metrics for a specific domain.

The dashboard displays the following metrics:

- **Threats** (threats by type, threats by country)
- **Requests** (total requests, cached requests, uncached requests, top countries by request, requests by IP class, top content types)
- **Bandwidth** (total bandwidth, encrypted and unencrypted traffic cached bandwidth, uncached bandwidth)
- **Caching** (Cache hit rate, request caching rate over time)
- **HTTP response status errors**
- **Page views**
- **Search Engine Bot Traffic**
- **DNS** (DNS queries, response time, top hostnames, queries by type, stale vs. uncached queries)
