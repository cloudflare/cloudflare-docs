# Splunk

This tutorial explains how to analyze [Cloudflare Logs](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-logs/) using the [Cloudflare App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/).

## Overview

If you haven’t used Cloudflare Logs before, visit our [Logs documentation](/) for more details. Contact your Cloudflare Customer Account Team to enable logs for your account.

This tutorial describes how to get Cloudflare logs from Amazon S3 into Splunk using the [Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876/). To learn how to use Logpush to send logs to AWS S3, refer to the [Logpush documentation](/logpush/). Alternatively, you can use [Logpull](/logpull-api/) to get logs to your [Splunk HTTP Event Collector](http://dev.splunk.com/view/event-collector/SP-CAAAE6M) directly and skip Task 1.

### Prerequisites

Before sending your Cloudflare log data to Splunk, make sure that you:

- Have an existing Splunk Enterprise or Cloud account
- Have a Cloudflare Enterprise account with Cloudflare Logs enabled
- Configure [Logpush](/logpush/) or [Logpull](/logpull-api/)
- Consult the [Splunk documentation](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/) for the Cloudflare App

<Aside type="note" header="Note">

Cloudflare logs are HTTP/HTTPS request logs in JSON format and are gathered from our 194+ data centers globally. By default, timestamps are returned as Unix nanosecond integers. We recommend using the RFC 3339 format for sending logs to Splunk.

## Task 1 - Connect AWS S3 to Splunk

Before completing this task, make sure you’ve enabled [Cloudflare Logpush on AWS S3](/logpush/aws-s3/).

To start receiving Cloudflare log data, you need to connect AWS S3 to Splunk as follows:

1. Log in to your Splunk instance > **Apps** > **Find More Apps.**

2. Search for **Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services.**

3. Use your Splunk account login credentials to download and install the application.

   ![Splunk update AWS S3 source to Cloudflare](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-aws-s3-update-source-to-cloudflare-json.png)
   Scroll down and select **More Settings**. Manually update field **Source type** to the value \_cloudflare:json_and click **Save**.
   ![Splunk update AWS S3 source type](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-data-input-aws-s3-source-type-cloudflare-json.png)

8. To create a new index go to **Settings** > **Indexes** > **New Index**, then enter \_cloudflare_as the **Index Name** and leave the default settings or update them according to your preferences. Then, click **Save**.
   ![Splunk create new index](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-settings-data-indexes.png)
   ![Splunk add new index name](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-create-new-index-cloudflare.png)

Now, logs should be loading into Splunk. You can verify this under **Splunk Add-on for AWS** > **Search**. In the search box, type:

`index=* sourcetype=cloudflare:json`

Next, select the desired time interval and and click **Search**.

If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to see Cloudflare logs as shown in the screenshot below.

## Task 2 - Install and Configure the Cloudflare App for Splunk

To install the [Cloudflare App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/):

1. Login to your Splunk instance.
2. Under **Apps** > **Find More Apps** search for _Cloudflare App for Splunk._
3. Click **Install**.

![Splunk find Cloudflare app](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-cloudflare-app-for-splunk.png)

Once installed, you need to configure the application. To do this, a set up page is included with the application:

1. Open the set up screen by clicking the **Apps** dropdown, then **Manage Apps** > **Cloudflare Set Up.**
2. Enter the **Index name** where the Cloudflare JSON logs are stored. This value must be entered in the format _index=index_name_. By default the value is set to _index=cloudflare_.
3. Optional: Enable [Data Model Acceleration](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.6/Knowledge/Acceleratedatamodels). This option is disabled by default.

![Splunk configure Cloudflare app](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-configure-cloudflare-index-app-wizard.png)

The Cloudflare App is now installed and the dashboards should be populating with data.

<Aside type="note" header="Note">

Some reports contain calculated fields. If you wish to check how values were calculated or to adjust formulas, click **Settings** > **Data Models** > **Cloudflare**. Here, you can view and edit all the available fields.
![Splunk data models](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-data-models-cloudflare.png)
![Splunk Cloudflare data model field](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-cloudflare-data-model-calculated-fields.png)
</Aside>

**Post Installation Notes**

You can change the **Index Name** after initial configuration by accessing the app **Set up** page by clicking on the **Apps** dropdown, then **Manage Apps** > **Cloudflare App for Splunk** > **Set up**.

![Splunk apps set up interface](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-apps-manage-apps-cloudflare-set-up.png)

Also, you can find the Index Name manually by visiting **Settings** > **Advanced search** > **Search macros**.

![Splunk search macros](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-settings-advanced-search-search-macros.png)

The Cloudflare App for Splunk comes with a custom Cloudflare Data Model which has an acceleration time frame of 1 day but is not accelerated by default. If you enable [Data Model acceleration](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.6/Knowledge/Acceleratedatamodels), we recommend that the Data Model is only accelerated for 1 or 7 days to ensure there are no adverse effects within your Splunk environment.

You can enable or disable acceleration after the initial configuration by accessing the app Set up page by clicking the **Apps** dropdown, then **Manage Apps** > **Cloudflare Set Up**.

![Splunk search macros](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-apps-manage-apps-cloudflare-set-up-enable-data-model-acceleration.png)

You can also manually configure Data Models by going to **Settings** > **Data models**. Learn more about data model acceleration [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Acceleratedatamodels).

## Task 3 - View the Dashboards

You can analyze Cloudflare logs with the thirteen (13) dashboards listed below.

You can use filters within these dashboards to help narrow the analysis by date and time, device type, country, user agent, client IP, hostname, and more to further help with debugging and tracing.

![Splunk dashboard Cloudflare Performance Static vs. Dynamic Content](../../static/images/splunk/dashboards/splunk-cloudflare-performance-static-vs-dynamic-dashboard.png)

### Filters

All dashboard have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Filters are applied across the entire dashboard.

![Splunk Cloudflare filters](../../static/images/splunk/screenshots/splunk-filters.png)

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data at a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

The default time interval is set to 24 hours. Note that for correct calculations filter will need to exclude Worker subrequests (**WorkerSubrequest** = _false_) and purge requests (**ClientRequestMethod** is not _PURGE_).

Available Filters:

- Time Range (EdgeStartTimestamp)

- Client Country

- Client Device type

- Client IP

- Client Request Host

- Client Request URI

- Client Request User Agent

- Edge response status

- Origin IP

- Origin Response Status

- RayID

- Worker Subrequest

- Client Request Method

## Debugging tips

### Incomplete dashboards

The Splunk Cloudflare App relies on data from the Cloudflare Enterprise Logs fields outlined below. Depending on which fields you have enabled, certain dashboards might not populate fully.

If that is the case, verify and test the Cloudflare App filters below each dashboard (these filters are the same across all dashboards). You can delete any filters that you don’t need, even if such filters include data fields already contained in your logs.

Also, you could compare the list of fields you are getting in Cloudflare Logs with the fields listed in **Splunk** > **Settings** > **Data Model** > **Cloudflare**.

The available fields are:

- CacheCacheStatus

- CacheResponseBytes

- CacheResponseStatus

- ClientASN

- ClientCountry

- ClientDeviceType

- ClientIP

- ClientIPClass
