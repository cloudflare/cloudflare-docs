<div id="how-many-rules-can-i-have-on-my-site">

#### How many rules can I have on my site?
</div>

You can create a large number of rules. However, the number of active rules at any given time is limited. See [Entitlements](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/#entitlements) for details on what's allowed per customer plan.

---------------------

<div id="can-i-purchase-additional-active-rules">

#### Can I purchase additional active rules?
</div>

No.  The number of active rules is fixed based on customer plan. *See [Entitlements](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/#entitlements)*.

<div id="how-are-certain-special-and-escaped-characters-handled">

#### How are certain special and escaped characters handled?
</div>

When used as literals in an expression, the backslash `\` and double quote `"` characters require proper escaping.

An expression built using the **Visual Expression Editor** in the **Firewall Rules** UI doesn't require you to manually escape those special characters. Conveniently, the **Expression Builder** takes care of any necessary escaping in the final expression by automatically prepending a backslash such that `\` and `"` become `\\` and `\"`, respectively.

The following image illustrates how double quotes are automatically escaped to `\"` once they appear in the plain text expression generated in the **Expression Editor**:

<div id="why-isn-t-my-regular-expression-pattern-matching-working">

#### Why isn't my regular expression pattern matching working?
</div>

If youâ€™re using a regular expression, we recommend you test it against an *RE2* testing tool like [Regular Expressions 101](https://regex101.com).

Also, note that *http.request.method* fields requires all-caps for method names.

<div id="how-can-i-use-the-threat-score-effectively">

#### How can I use the Threat Score effectively?
</div>

The *Cloudflare Threat Score* is a key item behind the **Security Level** functionality in the Cloudflare dashboard.

*Threat Score* as configured by **Security Level** is based on:

* High - for scores greater than 0
* Medium - for scores greater than 14
* Low - for scores greater than 24
* Essentially off - for scores greater than 49

Enabling a high threat score for sensitive areas, like comment form pages or login forms, can add an effective level of protection. Integrating  *Threat Score*  with Firewall Rules is advantageous because you can specify a Captcha vs. a JS Challenge, or even a block. You can also exclude IP addresses using *and not* logic.

#### How does Firewall Rules handle traffic from known bots?
</div>

##### Caution about potentially blocking bots

When you create a firewall rule with a *Block*, *Challenge (Captcha)*, or *JS Challenge* action, you might unintentionally block traffic from known bots. Specifically, this might affect search engine optimization (SEO) and website monitoring when trying to enforce a mitigation action based on URI, path, host, ASN, or country.

*See [How do I create an exception to exclude certain requests from being blocked or challenged?](#how-do-i-create-an-exception-to-exclude-certain-requests-from-being-blocked-or-challenged)*

##### Bots currently detected

The table below lists known bots that Firewall Rules currently detects.  When traffic comes from any of these bots, the *cf.client.bot* field is set to true.

<Aside type="note">

Cloudflare plans to expand its list of known bots in the near future.

<div id="how-do-i-create-an-exception-to-exclude-certain-requests-from-being-blocked-or-challenged">

#### How do I create an exception to exclude certain requests from being blocked or challenged?

</div>

There may be situations in which you want to enforce a blocking or challenging action but make exceptions for specific types of requests.

Cloudflare supports two methods to permit requests through Firewall Rules expressions:

1. Exclude a type of request from being blocked or challenged, for example based on IP address, ASN, or country
2. Create an independent firewall rule with an *Allow* action

<Aside type="note">

Cloudflare Firewall Rules does not bypass security measures defined in other **Firewall** app features.

</Aside>

If you wish to permit certain exclusions, the examples below illustrate a few possible approaches.

##### Example 1

Exclude multiple IP addresses from a blocking/challenging rule that assesses Threat Score

<table style="border: solid 2px darkgrey; width:100%;">
<tbody style="border: solid 2px darkgrey;">
<tr>
<td style="background:#EBEDEF;" colspan="2"><strong>Basic rule, with no <em>exclusion</em></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Action</td>
<td><em>block (or challenge)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expression</td>
<td><em>(http.host eq "example.com" and cf.threat_score &gt; 5)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background:#EBEDEF;" colspan="2"><strong>Rule that excludes IP addresses from being blocked/challenged</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Action</td>
<td><em>block (or challenge)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expression</td>
<td><em>(http.host eq "example.com" and cf.threat_score &gt; 5) and not (ip.src in {'{1.2.3.4 4.3.2.110.20.30.0/24}'})</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background:#EBEDEF;" colspan="2"><strong>Two rules to allow exceptions and block the rest</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rule 1</td>
<td>Action: <em>allow</em><br/>
Expression: <em>ip.src in {'{1.2.3.4 4.3.2.110.20.30.0/24}'}</em>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rule 2</td>
<td>Action: <em>block (or challenge)</em><br/>
<em>(http.host eq "example.com" and cf.threat_score &gt; 5)</em>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##### Example 2

Block Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) because of large volumes of undesired traffic, but allow Googlebot and other known bots that Cloudflare validates

<table style="border: solid 2px darkgrey; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="background: #EBEDEF;" colspan="2"><strong>Basic rule, with no <em>exclusion</em></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Action</td>
<td><em>block (or challenge)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expression</td>
<td><em>(ip.geoip.asnum in {'{7224 15169}'})</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background: #EBEDEF;" colspan="2"><strong>Rule that excludes known bots that Cloudflare validates</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Action</td>
<td><em>block (or challenge)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expression</td>
<td><em>(ip.geoip.asnum in {'{7224 15169}'}) and not cf.client.bot)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background: #EBEDEF;" colspan="2"><strong><strong>Two rules to allow exceptions and block the rest</strong></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rule 1</td>
<td>Action: <em>allow</em><br/>
Expression: <em>cf.client.bot</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rule 2</td>
<td>Action: <em>block (or challenge)</em><br/>
Expression: <em>(ip.geoip.asnum in {'{7224 15169}'})</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
