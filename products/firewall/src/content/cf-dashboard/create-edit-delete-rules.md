# Create, edit, and delete rules

The **Create Firewall Rule** page in the Firewall app is a good guide to the parts of a firewall rule. When an incoming HTTP request matches the **expression** in a firewall rule, the specified **action** is triggered:

![create firewall rule page](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-1.png)

Note that a simple expression has the following syntax:

    <field> <comparison operator> <value>

For more, see [_Expressions_](/cf-firewall-rules/fields-and-expressions/) and [_Actions_](/cf-firewall-rules/actions/).

## Expression Builder and Editor

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

Firewall Rules expressions have a 4KB limit (approximately 4,000 text characters).

</Aside>

The Firewall app in the Cloudflare dashboard offers two options for editing expressions.

The **Expression Builder** allows you to create expressions using drop-down lists and emphasizes an intuitive visual approach to creating firewall rules:

![expression builder](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-0.png)

The **Expression Editor** is a text-only interface that supports advanced features, such as grouping symbols and functions for transforming and validating values:

Both interfaces are available in the **Create Firewall Rule** page. This article focuses on using the Expression Builder. For more on using the advanced Expression Editor, see [_Edit rule expressions_](/cf-dashboard/expression-preview-editor/).

## Create a firewall rule

<Aside type='note' header='Note'>

Create a **Firewall Rule** based on the filters and exclusions you select within firewall analytics by clicking **Create firewall rule** within the **Overview** tab of the **Firewall** app.

</Aside>

To create a new firewall rule:

1. Log in to the **Cloudflare** dashboard.
1. Select the **Websites** tab and choose the site for which you want to create a new firewall rule.
1. To open Firewall Rules from the Cloudflare dashboard, click the **Firewall** tile in the app bar, and then click the **Firewall Rules** tab.

   ![firewall rules tab](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-2.png)

1. Click **Create a Firewall Rule**.

1. In the **Create Firewall Rule** page that displays, use the **Rule name** input to supply a descriptive name. The rule name in this example is "Does not originate in UK."

   ![create firewall rule](../images/create-firewall-rule-1.png)

1. Under **When incoming requests matchâ€¦**, use the **Field** drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for **Field** is compared to the value you specify for **Value**.

   ![select field](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-3.png)

1. Use the **Operator** drop-down list to choose a comparison operator. For an expression to match, the value of the request **Field** and the value specified in the **Value** input must satisfy the comparison operator.

   ![select operator](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-4.png)

   In the screenshot above, note that the **Expression Editor** area displays a text-only version of your expression. For more on Expression Editor and the Expression Editor, see [_Edit rule expressions_](/cf-dashboard/expression-preview-editor/).

1. Now specify the value to match. If the value is an enumeration, then the **Value** control will be a drop-down list. Otherwise, it will be a text input. In this example the value _United Kingdom_ is set using the **Country** drop-down list.

   ![select value](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-value.png)

1. To set an action for your rule, use the **Action** drop-down list. In this example the _Block_ action tells Cloudflare to refuse requests that originate from countries other than the United Kingdom.

   ![select action](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-5.png)

1. To save and deploy your rule, click **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, click **Save as draft**.

After you choose an option, you are returned to the **Rules List**, which displays your new rule:

![rules list](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-11.png)

If you choose to deploy your new rule, the toggle switch associated with the rule will be _On_. If you save the rule as a draft, the toggle will be _Off_. Use the toggle to enable or disable your firewall rule.

## Manage rules

### Edit rules

You can modify your existing firewall rules at any time. Click the **Edit** button (wrench icon) located on the right of your rules in the **Rules List** to open the **Edit Firewall Rule** panel and make the changes you want.

![edit rule](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-7.png)

### Delete rules

To delete an existing rule from the **Firewall Rules** panel, use the **Delete** button (**X** icon) associated with the rule you want to remove.

![delete rule](../images/firewall-rules-expression-builder-8.png)

In the confirmation dialog that appears, click **Delete** to confirm and complete the operation.

### Order rules

By default, Cloudflare evaluates firewall rules in **list order**, where rules are evaluated in the order they appear in the **Rules List**. When list ordering is enabled, the Rules List allows you to drag and drop firewall rules into position, as shown below.

<img src={firewallRulesExpressionBuilder10} alt="order rules" />

Once there are more than 200 total rules (including inactive rules), you must manage evaluation using **priority ordering**, in which Cloudflare evaluates firewall rules in order of their **priority number**, starting with the lowest. When you cross this threshold, the Firewall Rules interface automatically switches to priority ordering. For more on working with priority ordering, see [_Order and Priority_](/cf-firewall-rules/order-priority).

### Enable and disable rules

Use the toggle switch associated with a firewall rule to enable or disable it.

## Test firewall rules with Rule Preview

To help customers in the Enterprise plan understand the potential impact of a new firewall rule, Cloudflare built **Rule Preview**. With the click of a button, Rule Preview allows you to test a firewall rule against a sample of requests drawn from the last 72 hours of traffic. Rule Preview is built into the **Create Firewall Rule** and **Edit Firewall Rule** panels so that you can test a rule as you edit it. For more, see [_Preview rules_](/cf-dashboard/rule-preview/).
