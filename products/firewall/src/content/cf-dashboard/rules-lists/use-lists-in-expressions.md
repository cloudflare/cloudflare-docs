1. Select a Rules List from the **Value** drop-down list.

1. When you are done composing your rule, click **Deploy** to commit your changes and enable your rule. Click **Save as draft** if you are not ready to enable the rule.

## Expression Editor

To use a Rules List in the [Expression Editor](/cf-dashboard/expression-preview-editor) specify the `in` operator and use _\$<list_name>_ to specify the name of the list.

This expression filters requests from IP addresses that are in a Rules List named _office_network_:

```sql

(ip.src in $office_network)
```

Note that names for Rules Lists can only include lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore (`_`) character.

For more on creating lists, see [_Use Rules Lists: Manage lists_](/cf-dashboard/rules-lists/manage-lists).
