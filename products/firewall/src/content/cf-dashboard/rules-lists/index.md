# Use Rules Lists

Rules Lists allow you to create a group of IP addresses and refer to them collectively, by name, in your firewall rule expressions. For an introduction, see [_Rules Lists_](/cf-firewall-rules/rules-lists).

## Access the Lists interface

Because Rules Lists are stored at the account level, the **Lists** interface is located in your account **Configurations** page, not the Cloudflare dashboard.

To access the **Lists** interface, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Cloudflare account.
1. Click on your account name or profile picture in the header and select **Account Home**.
1. Click the **Configurations** tab.
1. Select **Lists**.

The **Lists** user interface displays.

1. [Add IP addresses to the list](/cf-dashboard/rules-lists/manage-items/#add-items-to-a-list).

## Use Rules Lists in expressions

To use Rules Lists in the Cloudflare dashboard, see [_Use lists in expressions_](/cf-dashboard/rules-lists/use-lists-in-expressions).
