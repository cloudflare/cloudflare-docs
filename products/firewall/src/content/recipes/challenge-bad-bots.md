# Challenge bad bots

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

Access to [Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bm-subscription) requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with Bot Management enabled.

</Aside>

Cloudflare’s Bot Management feature scores the likelihood that a request originates from a bot.

Scores range from 1 through 99. Low scores indicate the request comes from a script, API service, or an automated agent. High scores indicate that a human issued the request from a standard desktop or mobile web browser.

These examples use:
- `cf.bot_management.score` [dynamic field](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#dynamic-fields) to target requests from bots
- `cf.bot_management.verified_bot` to identify requests from [known good bots](/known-issues-and-faq#bots-currently-detected)
- `cf.bot_management.ja3_hash` to target specific [JA3 Fingerprints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/ja3-fingerprint)

## Suggested rules

For best results:
- Use [Bot Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bm-subscription#enable-bot-management-for-enterprise) to learn about your traffic before applying rules
- Start small and increase your bot threshold over time

Your rules may also vary based on the [nature of your site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bm-subscription#5-create-additional-firewall-rules) and your tolerance for false positives.

### Protect browser endpoints

When a request is definitely automated (score of 1) or likely automated (scores 2 through 29) and is _not_ on the list of known good bots, Cloudflare **blocks** the request.

<table style='table-layout:fixed; width:100%'>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Expression</th>
    <th style='width:20%'>Action</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(cf.bot_management.score lt 30) and not (cf.bot_management.verified_bot)</code></td>
      <td><em>Block</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Exempt API traffic

Since Bot Management detects automated users, you need to explicitly allow your **good** automated traffic⁠ — this includes your APIs and partner APIs.

This example offers the same protection as the browser-only rule, but allows automated traffic to your API.

<table style='table-layout:fixed; width:100%'>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Expression</th>
    <th style='width:20%'>Action</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(cf.bot_management.score lt 30) and not (cf.bot_management.verified_bot) and not (http.request.uri.path contains "/api")</code></td>
      <td><em>Block</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### Adjust for mobile traffic

Since Bot Management can be more sensitive to mobile traffic, you may want to add in additional logic to avoid blocking legitimate requests.

If you are handling requests from your own mobile application, you could potentially allow it based on its specific [JA3 fingerprint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/ja3-fingerprint).

<table style='table-layout:fixed; width:100%'>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Expression</th>
    <th style='width:20%'>Action</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
      <td><code>(cf.bot_management.ja3_hash eq df669e7ea913f1ac0c0cce9a201a2ec1)</code></td>
      <td><em>Allow</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Otherwise, you could set lower thresholds for mobile traffic. The following rules would block definitely automated mobile traffic and challenge likely automated traffic.

<table style='table-layout:fixed; width:100%'>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Expression</th>
    <th style='width:20%'>Action</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(cf.bot_management.score lt 2) and (http.user_agent contains "App_Name 2.0")</code></td>
      <td><em>Block</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(cf.bot_management.score lt 30) and (http.user_agent contains "App_Name 2.0")</code></td>
      <td><em>Challenge</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Layer rules

If your domain saw mobile, browser, and API traffic, you would want to arrange these example rules in the following order:
- API
- Mobile:
  - If consistent JA3 fingerprint, set *Allow* rule.
  - If not, put the *Block* rule first and then the *Challenge* rule.
- Browser - Block

### Static resource protection

Static resources are protected by default when you create **Firewall Rules** using `cf.bot_management.score`.

To exclude static resources, include <code class="InlineCode">not (cf.botManagement.staticResource)</code> as part of your Firewall Rule. For more details, see [Static resource protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/about/static-resources).

### Additional considerations

From there, you could customize your Firewall Rules based on specific request paths(`/login` or `/signup`), common traffic patterns, or many other characteristics.

Just make sure to set aside time to review [Bot Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/bot-analytics/bm-subscription) and [Firewall Events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics) to see if your rules need additional tuning.
