# Custom Firewall rules

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

This feature is only available for selected customers on an Enterprise plan. Contact your Cloudflare Customer Success Manager if you want to get access.

</Aside>

Custom Firewall rules allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests. You can block or challenge incoming requests according to the rules you define.

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/cf-rulesets), Custom Firewall rules have an **expression** and an **action**:

* The **expression** specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on â€” the same as in [Firewall Rules](/cf-firewall-rules).
* The **action** specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule.
