# Custom Firewall rules

Custom Firewall rules allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests. You can perform actions like _Block_ or _JS Challenge_ on incoming requests according to rules you define.

This feature is only available for selected customers on an Enterprise plan. Contact your Cloudflare Customer Success Manager if you want to get access.

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](/cf-rulesets), Custom Firewall rules have an **expression** and an **action**:

* The **expression** specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on â€” the same as in [Firewall Rules](/cf-firewall-rules).
* The **action** specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule.
