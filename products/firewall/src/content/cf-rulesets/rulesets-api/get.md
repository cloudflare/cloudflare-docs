## List Rulesets

Returns the latest version of all rulesets owned by the account and any managed rulesets the account is entitled to use.

Results are sorted by Ruleset ID in ascending order.

### Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "managed_ruleset_id",
      "name": "Cloudflare managed ruleset",
      "kind": "managed",
      "version": "1",

      "last_updated": "2020-07-17T16:01:43.997713Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Get Ruleset

```bash
GET  accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}
```

Returns the ruleset with the specified Ruleset ID.

The API returns a HTTP Status Code 404 under these conditions:

* When a ruleset cannot be found.
* When the specified ruleset is not a managed ruleset the calling account is entitled to deploy.

### Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}"

    }
  ],

}
```

## Get Version of Ruleset

```bash
accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset-id}/versions/{version-number}

  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset-id}/versions/1"
```

    "version": "1",
    "rules": [
      {

      }
    ],
    "last_updated": "2020-07-17T15:42:37.917815Z"
  }
}
```

## View rules tagged with a category
