# Rulesets API

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

This feature is part of an early access experience for selected customers.

</Aside>

The Rulesets API provides an interface for managing the deployment of managed rulesets from your root ruleset. A managed ruleset contains a list of rules and actions. From the root ruleset, you configure rules to filter all traffic for your account and deploy managed rulesets for a specified domain.

## Get started

To get started, review the Rulesets [JSON object](/cf-rulesets/rulesets-api/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/cf-rulesets/rulesets-api/endpoints/).
