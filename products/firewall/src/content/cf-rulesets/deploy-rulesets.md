# Deploy rulesets

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

This feature is part of an early access experience for selected customers.

</Aside>

Use the [Rulesets API](/cf-rulesets/rulesets-api) to deploy or execute a ruleset. Add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to a phase, specifying the Ruleset ID as an action parameter. This rule executes the ruleset. Use a separate rule for each ruleset you want to deploy.

A rule that deploys a ruleset consists of:

* The **ID of the ruleset** you want to deploy.
* An **expression**.
* An **action**. To deploy a ruleset, set the action to execute. The rules in the ruleset are executed when a request satisfies the expression.

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

When deploying a ruleset to a phase at the **account** level, use the expression to define the hosts the ruleset applies to. The only field you can use in a rule expression to deploy a ruleset in a phase at the account level is `cf.zone.name`. The following operators are valid: `equals`, `not equals`, `contains`, `does not contain`, `is in`, `is not in`.

When deploying a ruleset to a phase at the **zone** level, you must set the expression to `true`. 

</Aside>

## Example

The following example deploys a Managed Ruleset to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`{zone-id}`).

When deploying to a zone-level phase, you must set `expression` to `true`, since the zone scope is already defined in the endpoint.
