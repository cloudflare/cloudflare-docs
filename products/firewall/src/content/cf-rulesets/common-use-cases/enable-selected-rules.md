# Use rulesets and rule overrides to only enable selected rules

<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

This feature is part of an early access experience for selected customers.

</Aside>

Use a ruleset override and a rule override in the ruleset of a phase to deploy selected rules in a Managed Ruleset.

1. [Add a rule](/cf-rulesets/deploy-rulesets) to the ruleset of a phase to deploy a Managed Ruleset.
1. [Configure a ruleset override](/cf-rulesets/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset) that disables all rules in the ruleset.
1. [Configure a rule override](/cf-rulesets/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset) to set an action for the rules you want to deploy.

<div>

The following `PUT` request uses the [Update ruleset](/cf-rulesets/rulesets-api/update/) operation at the zone level to deploy only two rules from a Managed Ruleset to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

In this example:

* `"id": "{managed-ruleset-id}"` adds a rule to the phase to apply a Managed Ruleset to requests for the specified zone (`{zone-id}`).
* `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the Managed Ruleset.
* `"rules": [{"id": "{rule-id-1}", "action": "block", "enabled": true}, {"id": "{rule-id-2}", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines a list of overrides at the rule level to enable two individual rules.

<summary>Example: Deploy ruleset and rule overrides at the account level</summary>
<div>

The following `PUT` request uses the [Update ruleset](/cf-rulesets/rulesets-api/update/) operation at the account level to deploy only two rules from a Managed Ruleset to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

In this example:

* `"id": "{managed-ruleset-id}"` adds a rule to the phase to apply a Managed Ruleset to requests for `example.com`.
* `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the Managed Ruleset.
* `"rules": [{"id": "{rule-id-1}", "action": "block", "enabled": true}, {"id": "{rule-id-2}", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines a list of overrides at the rule level to enable two individual rules.
