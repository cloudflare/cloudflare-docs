<Aside type='warning' header='Important'>

This feature is part of an early access experience for selected customers.

</Aside>

You cannot edit Managed Rulesets, but you can add overrides to Managed Rulesets deployed to a phase. Overrides take precedence over the default behavior of the Managed Ruleset.

For more information on overriding Managed Rulesets, see [Override a Managed Ruleset](/cf-rulesets/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).

The examples in the topics below use overrides to customize the behavior of Managed Rulesets.

* [Use a tag override to set WordPress rules to Block](/cf-rulesets/common-use-cases/deploy-cmr-wordpress-block/)
* [Use ruleset and tag overrides to enable only Joomla rules](/cf-rulesets/common-use-cases/deploy-cmr-joomla-only/)
* [Use ruleset and rule overrides to enable only selected rules](/cf-rulesets/common-use-cases/enable-selected-rules/)
* [Deploy a Managed Ruleset with ruleset, tag, and rule overrides](/cf-rulesets/common-use-cases/override-ruleset-tag-rule/)
