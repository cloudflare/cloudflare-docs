# Manage rules via the APIs

When it comes to programmatic rule management, Cloudflare offers APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI based **Firewall Rules** feature of the **Firewall** app in the dashboard.

These APIs are:

* The [Firewall Rules API](/api/cf-firewall-rules/) - to manage rules and their actions, based on criteria separately defined through filters.
* The [Rules List API](/api/cf-lists/) - to manage named lists of IP addresses that you can use within firewall rules to filter traffic.
* The [Cloudflare Filters API](/api/cf-filters/) - to manage the filters that enable rule matching.
