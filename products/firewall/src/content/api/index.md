# Manage rules via the APIs

When it comes to programmatic rule management, Cloudflare offers APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI based **Firewall Rules** feature of the Cloudflare dashboard **Firewall** app.

These APIs are:

- the [Firewall Rules API](/api/cf-firewall-rules/) - to manage rules and their actions, based on criteria separately defined through filters.
- the [Rules List API](/api/cf-lists/) - to manage named lists of IP addresses that you can use within firewall rules to filter traffic.
- the [Cloudflare Filters API](/api/cf-filters/) - to manage the filters that enable rule matching.
