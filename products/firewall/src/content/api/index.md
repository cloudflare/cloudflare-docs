When it comes to programmatic rule management, Cloudflare offers two APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI based **Firewall Rules** feature of the Cloudflare dashboard **Firewall** app.

These APIs are:

* the [Firewall Rules API](/firewall/api/cf-firewall-rules/) - to manage rules and their actions, based on criteria seperately defined through filters.
* the [Cloudflare Filters API](/firewall/api/cf-filters/) - to manage the filters that enable rule matching.
