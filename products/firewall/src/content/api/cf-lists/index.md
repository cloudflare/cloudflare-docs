# Rules Lists API

The Rules Lists API supports different types of lists:

* Use [IP Lists](/cf-firewall-rules/rules-lists/) to create a group of IP addresses and refer to them collectively, by name, in your Firewall Rule expressions.

* Use [Bulk Redirect Lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/bulk-redirects) to define lists of redirects that you enable by creating a Bulk Redirect Rule.

The [Rules Lists API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#rules-lists-properties) provides an interface for programmatically managing these types of lists.

To use an IP List in a rule expression, refer to [Values: Lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#lists) in the Rules language documentation.

## Get started

To get started, review the Lists [JSON object](/api/cf-lists/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/api/cf-lists/endpoints/).
