# Rules Lists API

Use [Rules Lists](/cf-firewall-rules/rules-lists/) to create a group of IP addresses and refer to them collectively, by name, in your firewall rule expressions.

The [Rules Lists API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#rules-lists-properties) provides an interface for programmatically managing lists.

To use a Rules List in an expression, see [_Values: Rules Lists_](/cf-firewall-language/values/#rules-lists) in the Firewall Rules language documentation.

## Get started

To get started, review the Rules Lists [JSON object](/api/cf-lists/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/api/cf-lists/endpoints/).
