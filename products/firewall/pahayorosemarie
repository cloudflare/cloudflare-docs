Manage Firewall Rules via the APIs
When it comes to programmatic Firewall Rule management, Cloudflare offers APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI based Firewall Rules feature of the Firewall app in the dashboard.

These APIs are the following:

Firewall Rules API: Manage Firewall Rules and their actions, based on criteria separately defined through filters.
Filters API: Manage the filters that enable rule matching.
Rules Lists API: Manage named lists of IP addresses that you can use within Firewall Rules to filter traffic.
