1.1.1.1 is a fast and private way to browse the internet. It is a DNS resolver - kind of like Google Maps for your computer, it translates places (like cloudflare.com) into addresses (like `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`). 1.1.1.1 is deployed in 150+ cities worldwide, and has access to the addresses of 7M+ domain names on the same servers it runs on so [itâ€™s the fastest resolver out there](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers).

The addresses of 1.1.1.1 are:

- `1.1.1.1`
- `1.0.0.1`
- `2606:4700:4700::1111`
- `2606:4700:4700::1001`

Moreover, you can access 1.1.1.1 as a Tor hidden service at this address:

- [dns4torpnlfs2ifuz2s2yf3fc7rdmsbhm6rw75euj35pac6ap25zgqad.onion](./fun-stuff/dns-over-tor/).
