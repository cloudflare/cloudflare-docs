It is a DNS resolver - kind of like Google Maps for your computer, it translates places (like cloudflare.com) into addresses (like 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2). 1.1.1.1 is deployed in 150+ cities worldwide, and has access to the addresses of 7M+ domain names on the same servers it runs on so [itâ€™s the fastest resolver out there](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers).

The addresses of 1.1.1.1 are:

- 1.1.1.1
- 1.0.0.1
- 2606:4700:4700::1111
- 2606:4700:4700::1001
