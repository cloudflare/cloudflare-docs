# DNS over TLS

By default, DNS is sent over a plaintext connection. DNS over TLS is one way to send DNS queries over an encrypted connection. Cloudflare supports DNS over TLS on standard port 853 and is compliant with [RFC7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858).

## Configuration

Cloudflare supports DNS over TLS on 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 on port 853. The certificate presented is for cloudflare-dns.com.

## How it works

A stub resolver (the DNS client on a device that talks to the DNS resolver) connects to the resolver over a TLS connection:

 * Before the connection the DNS stub resolver has stored a base64 encoded SHA256 hash of cloudflare-dns.com's TLS certificate (called SPKI)
 * DNS stub resolver establishes a TCP connection with cloudflare-dns.com:853
 * DNS stub resolver initiates a TLS handshake
 * In the TLS handshake, cloudflare-dns.com presents its TLS certificate.
 * Once the TLS connection is established, the DNS stub resolver can send DNS over an encrypted connection, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
 * All DNS queries sent over the TLS connection must comply with specifications of [sending DNS over TCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-4.2.2).
