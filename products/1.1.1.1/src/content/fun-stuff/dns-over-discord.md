# DNS over Discord

Ever wanted to make DNS requests from the comfort of your Discord server? Well now you can, thanks to the [@1.1.1.1 bot](https://cfl.re/3nM6VfQ).

To start using the DNS over Discord bot, invite it to your Discord server using this link: [https://cfl.re/3nM6VfQ](https://cfl.re/3nM6VfQ)

## dig command

Once the bot is in your server, type `/dig` to begin using the bot's main command -- performing DNS lookups.
This will provide a native interface within Discord that allows you to specify the domain to lookup, an optional DNS record type and an optional flag for a short result.

Due to limitations in Discord, the `/dig` command can only offer 10 different DNS record types, and will default to 'A' records if none is specified.

![dig command types](../static/dns-over-discord/dig-command-types.png)

### Supported record types

*   A
*   AAAA
*   CAA
*   CERT
*   CNAME
*   MX
*   NS
*   SPF
*   SRV
*   TXT

*For all DNS record types, use the `/multi-dig` command.*

### Examples

![dig domain: cloudflare.com](../static/dns-over-discord/dig-command-example-1.png)

_`/dig domain: cloudflare.com`_

![dig domain: cloudflare.com type: AAAA short: True](../static/dns-over-discord/dig-command-example-2.png)

_`/dig domain: cloudflare.com type: AAAA short: True`_

## multi-dig command

Want to lookup multiple DNS record types at once, or record types not available in `/dig`?
The `/multi-dig` command allows you to specify any supported DNS record type, and multiple types separated by a space.

When providing DNS record types for the `/multi-dig` command, Discord will not prompt you with options.
Please provide a space-separated list of valid DNS record types to lookup, any invalid options will be silently dropped.
'A' records will be used as the default if no valid types are given.
