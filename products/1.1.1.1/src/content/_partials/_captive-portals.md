<Aside type="note">

Setting up a static IP address to configure a DNS server may prevent you from connecting to some public Wi-Fi networks that use captive portals (these are the web pages some wireless networks employ to let users log in and use their services). 

If you are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals:
1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
1. Once the connection has been established, re-add the static IP addresses or enable the 1.1.1.1 app.
