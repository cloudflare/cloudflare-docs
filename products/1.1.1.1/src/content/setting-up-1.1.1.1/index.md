1.1.1.1 is a fast and private way to browse the internet. It is a DNS resolver - kind of like Google Maps for your computer, it translates places (like cloudflare.com) into addresses (like 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2). 1.1.1.1 is deployed in 150+ cities worldwide, and has access to the addresses of 7M+ domain names on the same servers it runs on so [it’s the fastest resolver out there](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers).

The addresses of 1.1.1.1 are:

  * 1.1.1.1
  * 1.0.0.1
  * 2606:4700:4700::1111
  * 2606:4700:4700::1001

Moreover, you can access 1.1.1.1 as a Tor hidden service at this address:

  * [dns4torpnlfs2ifuz2s2yf3fc7rdmsbhm6rw75euj35pac6ap25zgqad.onion](./fun-stuff/dns-over-tor/).
