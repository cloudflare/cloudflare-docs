# Android

## Android 9 Pie or later

Android Pie or later supports Private DNS, which uses DNS over TLS to secure your queries.
If your device runs Android version 9 or later, this is the recommended method to set up 1.1.1.1 because unlike previous versions
of Android, it does not need to be configured for each new Wi-Fi network.

Follow these steps to configure your device to use 1.1.1.1.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Network & internet** > **Advanced** > **Private DNS**.

1. Select the **Private DNS** provider hostname option.

1. Enter `one.one.one.one` or `1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com` and hit **Save**.

1. Visit [1.1.1.1/help](https://1.1.1.1/help) to verify DNS over TLS is enabled.

## Previous versions

Follow this quick guide to start using 1.1.1.1 on your Android.

1. Click **Modify Network**.

1. Click the check box **Show Advanced Options**.

1. Change the IP Settings to **Static**.

1. Remove any IP addresses that may be already listed and in their place add:

    ```txt
    1.1.1.1
    1.0.0.1
    2606:4700:4700::1111
    2606:4700:4700::1001
    ```
