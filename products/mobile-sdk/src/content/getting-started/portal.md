If you have copied the Client Key and downloaded the SDK, you are now ready to integrate Cloudflare's Mobile SDK with your App.

Before, you can verify that the SDK has installed, you need to integrate the SDK to your app. Use the platform specific guides to integrate the SDK:

* [Android](/getting_started/android)

Once you have completed the above steps, run your app (simulator is fine). Click on the following button to verify that you have successfully installed the Cloudflare Mobile SDK.
