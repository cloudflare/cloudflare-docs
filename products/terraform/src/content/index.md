# Cloudflare Terraform

Configure Cloudflare using HashiCorp's “Infrastructure as Code” tool, Terraform. With Cloudflare’s Terraform provider, you can manage your edge using the same familiar tools you use to automate the rest of your infrastructure. Define and store configuration in source code repositories like GitHub, track and version changes over time, and roll back when needed — all without needing to use the Cloudflare APIs.

Report Terraform configuration issues via [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/new/choose).
