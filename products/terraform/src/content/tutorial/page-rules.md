# Making some exceptions

In [step 3](/tutorial/zone-settings) we configured zone settings that apply to all of example.com. In this step we're going to add an exception to these settings by using [Page Rules](https://www.cloudflare.com/features-page-rules/).

Specifically, we're going to turn increase the security level for a URL we know is expensive to render (and cannot be cached): https://www.example.com/expensive-db-call. Additionally, we're going to add a redirect from the previous URL we used to host this page.

## 1. Create a new branch and append the page rule

As usual we'll create a new branch and append our configuration.

```sh
$ git checkout -b step6-pagerule
Switched to a new branch 'step6-pagerule'

$ cat >> cloudflare.tf <<'EOF'
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "increase-security-on-expensive-page" {
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  target   = "www.${var.domain}/expensive-db-call"
  priority = 1

  actions = {
    security_level = "under_attack",
  }
}

resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "redirect-to-new-db-page" {
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  target   = "www.${var.domain}/old-location.php"
  priority = 2

  actions = {
    forwarding_url {
      url = "https://www.${var.domain}/expensive-db-call"
      status_code = 301
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

## 2. Preview and merge the changes

You know the drill: preview the changes Terraform is going to make and then merge them into the master branch.

```sh
$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

cloudflare_rate_limit.login-limit: Refreshing state... (ID: 8d518c5d6e63406a9466d83cb8675bb6)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.

## 3. Apply and verify the changes

First we'll test requesting the (now missing) old location of the expensive-to-render page.

```sh
$ curl -vso /dev/null https://www.example.com/old-location.php 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP\|Location"
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

As expected, it can't be found. Let's apply the Page Rules, including the redirect that should fix this error.

```sh
$ terraform apply --auto-approve

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

With the Page Rules in place, let's try that call again, along with the I'm Under Attack Mode test:

```sh
$ curl -vso /dev/null https://www.example.com/old-location.php 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP\|Location"
< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
< Location: https://www.upinatoms.com/expensive-db-call

$ curl -vso /dev/null https://www.upinatoms.com/expensive-db-call 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
```

Great, they work as expected! In the first case the Cloudflare edge responds with a `301` redirecting the browser to the new location. In the second case it initially responds with a `503` (as is consistent with the "I Am Under Attack" mode).
