# Add exceptions with Page Rules

In [step 3](/tutorial/configure-https-settings), you configured zone settings that apply to all of example.com. In this tutorial, you will add an exception to these settings using [Page Rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/218411427).

Specifically, you will increase the security level for a URL known to be expensive to render and cannot be cached: `https://www.example.com/expensive-db-call`. Additionally, you will add a redirect from the previous URL used to host this page.

## 1. Create a new branch and append the page rule

Create a new branch and append the configuration.

```sh
$ git checkout -b step6-pagerule
Switched to a new branch 'step6-pagerule'

$ cat >> cloudflare.tf <<'EOF'
resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "increase-security-on-expensive-page" {
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  target   = "www.${var.domain}/expensive-db-call"
  priority = 1

  actions = {
    security_level = "under_attack",
  }
}

resource "cloudflare_page_rule" "redirect-to-new-db-page" {
  zone_id  = var.zone_id
  target   = "www.${var.domain}/old-location.php"
  priority = 2

  actions = {
    forwarding_url {
      url = "https://www.${var.domain}/expensive-db-call"
      status_code = 301
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

## 2. Preview and merge the changes

Preview the changes Terraform will make and then merge them into the master branch.

```sh
$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

cloudflare_rate_limit.login-limit: Refreshing state... (ID: 8d518c5d6e63406a9466d83cb8675bb6)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.

## 3. Apply and verify the changes

First, test request the (now missing) old location of the expensive-to-render page.

```sh
$ curl -vso /dev/null https://www.example.com/old-location.php 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP\|Location"
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

As expected, the location cannot be found. Apply the Page Rules, including the redirect that should fix this error.

```sh
$ terraform apply --auto-approve

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

With the Page Rules in place, try that call again along with the I'm Under Attack Mode test:

```sh
$ curl -vso /dev/null https://www.example.com/old-location.php 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP\|Location"
< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
< Location: https://www.upinatoms.com/expensive-db-call

$ curl -vso /dev/null https://www.upinatoms.com/expensive-db-call 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"
< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
```

The call works as expected. In the first case, the Cloudflare edge responds with a `301` redirecting the browser to the new location. In the second case, the Cloudflare edge initially responds with a `503` which is consistent with the "I Am Under Attack" mode.
