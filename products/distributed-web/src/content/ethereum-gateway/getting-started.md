# Getting started

Cloudflare's Ethereum Gateway is part of the wider Distributed Web Gateway
offering, specifically providing access to the Ethereum network. In particular,
users can read all information that has been agreed upon by the consensus of
existing nodes in the network. In addition, they can write their own
transactions and smart contracts to be stored by these nodes in a distributed
manner. Anyone else on the network will be able to view these transactions, and
even run your smart contracts using their own supply of the Ethereum currency.

Cloudflare's Gateway is hosted at https://cloudflare-eth.com, can be interacted
with using the [official Ethereum JSONRPC
API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC). This guide is for users
that would like to learn more about how to use our Gateway, including how to set
up your own domain as a entry-point to the Ethereum network, using the
Cloudflare Gateway.
