# Ethereum Gateway

Cloudflare's Ethereum Gateway lets you interact with the Ethereum network
without installing any software on your computer.

Our gateway makes it possible to add interactive elements to sites powered by
Ethereum smart contracts on a decentralized compute platform. Combined with the
[IPFS gateway](/ipfs-gateway/), you have decentralized web and
resource hosting with the added speed, security, and reliability of the
Cloudflare edge network. And you have direct access our Ethereum Gateway at
[https://cloudflare-eth.com](https://cloudflare-eth.com).

Welcome to the new era of distributed computing!
