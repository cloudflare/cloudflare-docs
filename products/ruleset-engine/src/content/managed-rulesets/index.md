# Work with Managed Rulesets

Managed Rulesets are preconfigured rulesets provided by Cloudflare that you can deploy. Only Cloudflare can modify these rulesets.

The rules in a Managed Ruleset have a default configuration. However, you can define overrides that change this default configuration.

On the Cloudflare dashboard you define overrides through **configurations**.

There are several Cloudflare products that provide you with Managed Rulesets. Check each product’s documentation for details on the available Managed Rulesets.

## Get started

To view available Managed Rulesets, see [View rulesets](/basic-operations/view-rulesets).

To deploy a Managed Ruleset to a phase, see [Deploy a Managed Ruleset](/managed-rulesets/deploy-managed-ruleset).

You cannot edit the rules in a Managed Ruleset, but you can customize the Managed Ruleset behavior by using overrides. Refer to [Override a Managed Ruleset](/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset) for more information.
