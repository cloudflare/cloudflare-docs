# Override a Managed Ruleset

You cannot add or remove rules from a Managed Ruleset, but you can customize its behavior by overriding it at deployment. When you override a ruleset you specify changes to be executed on top of the default configuration. These changes take precedence over the ruleset's default behavior.

For example, if you want to test a ruleset before enforcing it, you may want to execute a Managed Ruleset with all rules set to `log` instead of their default actions. To accomplish this, override the configured behavior of the Managed Ruleset at the ruleset level, so that each rule uses the _Log_ action.

## Working with overrides

You can override a ruleset at three levels:

* **Ruleset overrides** apply to all rules in the executed ruleset.
* **Tag overrides** apply to all rules with a specific tag. For example, use a tag override to customize the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset so all rules with the `wordpress` tag are set to _Block_. If multiple tags have overrides and if a given rule has more than one of these tags, the tag overrides order determines the behavior. For rules tagged with multiple overridden tags, the last tag's overrides apply.
* **Rule overrides** apply to specific rules in a Managed Ruleset, referenced by their Rule ID.

To apply an override for a Managed Ruleset:

* Call the [Update ruleset](/rulesets-api/update) method on your account-level phase entry point.
* Specify the `overrides` in the `action_parameters` of the rule that executes your Managed Ruleset.

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "id": "{ruleset-id}",
  "overrides": {
    // ruleset overrides
    "property-to-modify": "value",
    "property-to-modify": "value",
    // tag overrides
    "categories": [
      {
        "category": "{tag-name}",
        "property-to-modify": "value",
        "property-to-modify": "value"
      }
    ],
    // rule overrides
    "rules": [
      {
        "id": "{rule-id}",
        "property-to-modify": "value",
        "property-to-modify": "value"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Specific overrides take precedence over more general ones, and rule overrides take precedence over tag overrides, which take precedence over ruleset overrides.

You can override the following rule properties:

* `"action"` (`"block"`, `"challenge"`, `"log"`)
* `"enabled"` (`true`, `false`)

Some Managed Rulesets may have additional override requirements, or they may allow you to override other rule properties. Check each Cloudflare productâ€™s documentation for details.

## Examples

The following request adds a rule that executes a Managed Ruleset in the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase and defines a ruleset override to execute the `log` action for all rules in that ruleset.
