# Delete a rule in a ruleset

Deletes a single rule in a ruleset at the account or zone level.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

| Operation | Method + URL stub |
|-----------|-------------------|
| [Delete an individual rule][dr-account] (account) | `DELETE /accounts/{account-id}/rulesets/{ruleset-id}/rules/{rule-id}` |
| Delete an individual rule (zone) | `DELETE /zones/{zone-id}/rulesets/{ruleset-id}/rules/{rule-id}` |

[dr-account]: https://api.cloudflare.com/#account-rulesets-delete-an-individual-rule

If the delete operation succeeds, the API method call returns a `200 OK` HTTP status code with the complete ruleset in the response body.

## Example

The following example deletes rule `{rule-id-1}` belonging to ruleset `{ruleset-id}`.
