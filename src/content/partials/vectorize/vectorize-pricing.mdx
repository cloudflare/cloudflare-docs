### Calculating vector dimensions

To calculate your potential usage, calculate the queried vector dimensions and the stored vector dimensions, and multiply by the unit price. The formula is defined as `((queried vectors + stored vectors) * dimensions * ($0.01 / 1,000,000)) + (stored vectors + dimensions * ($0.05 / 100,000,000))`

- For example, inserting 10,000 vectors of 768 dimensions each, and querying those 1,000 times per day (30,000 times per month) would be calculated as `((30,000 + 10,000) * 768) = 30,720,000` queried dimensions and `(10,000 * 768) = 7,680,000` stored dimensions (within the included monthly allocation)
- Separately, and excluding the included monthly allocation, this would be calculated as `(30,000 + 10,000) * 768 * ($0.01 / 1,000,000) + (10,000 * 768 * ($0.05 / 100,000,000))` and sum to $0.31 per month.
