:::note[Using legacy Vectorize (V1) indexes?]

Please use the `wrangler vectorize --deprecated-v1` flag to create, get, list, delete and insert vectors into legacy Vectorize V1 indexes.

Refer to the [legacy transition](/vectorize/reference/transition-vectorize-legacy) page for more details on transitioning away from legacy indexes.
