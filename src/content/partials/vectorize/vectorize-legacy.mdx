:::note[Using legacy Vectorize (V1) indexes?]

Please use the `wrangler vectorize --deprecated-v1` flag to create, get, list, delete and insert vectors into legacy Vectorize V1 indexes.

Please note that by December 2024, you will not be able to create legacy Vectorize indexes. Other operations will remain functional.

Refer to the [legacy transition](/vectorize/reference/transition-vectorize-legacy) page for more details on transitioning away from legacy indexes.
