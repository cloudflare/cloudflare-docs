### Dashboard

Editing in the dashboard is helpful for simpler use cases.

Once you have created your Worker script, you can edit and deploy your Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Select **Workers & Pages**.
3. Select your application.
4. Select **Edit Code**.

### Wrangler CLI

To develop more advanced applications or [implement tests](/workers/testing/), start working in the Wrangler CLI.

1. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/).

:::note[Node.js version manager]

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

3. Run the following command, replacing the value of `[<DIRECTORY>]` which the location you want to put your Worker Script.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="npm">

```sh
$ npm create cloudflare@latest [<DIRECTORY>] -- --type=pre-existing
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
$ yarn create cloudflare@latest [<DIRECTORY>] --type=pre-existing
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
$ pnpm create cloudflare@latest [<DIRECTORY>] --type=pre-existing
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="bun">

```sh
$ bun create cloudflare@latest [<DIRECTORY>] --type=pre-existing
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

After you run this command - and work through the prompts - your local changes will not automatically sync with dashboard. So, once you download your script, continue using the CLI.
