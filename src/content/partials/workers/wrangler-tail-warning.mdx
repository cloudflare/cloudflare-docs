:::caution

When updating a Worker with Wrangler the [Tail Consumer](/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers) config will be removed. Please add the tail_consumer config to the top level of your [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file.

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
tail_consumers = [{service = "<TAIL_WORKER_NAME>"}]
```

</WranglerConfig>
