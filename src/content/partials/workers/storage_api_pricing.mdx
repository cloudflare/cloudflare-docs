The Durable Objects [Storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api) is only accessible from within Durable Objects.

Durable Objects do not have to use the Storage API, but if your code does call methods on `ctx.storage`, it will incur additional charges.

Pricing depends on whether a Durable Object class has default, key-value storage backend or opt-in [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sqlite-storage-backend).

### Key-value storage backend

|                                  | Workers Paid plan          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Read request units<sup>1,2</sup> | 1 million, + $0.20/million |
| Write request units<sup>3</sup>  | 1 million, + $1.00/million |
| Delete requests<sup>4</sup>      | 1 million, + $1.00/million |
| Stored data<sup>5</sup>          | 1 GB, + $0.20/ GB-month    |

<sup>1</sup> A request unit is defined as 4 KB of data read or written. A request that writes or reads more than 4 KB will consume multiple units, for example, a 9 KB write will consume 3 write request units.

<sup>2</sup>  List operations are billed by read request units, based on the amount of data examined. For example, a list request that returns a combined 80 KB of keys and values will be billed 20 read request units. A list request that does not return anything is billed for 1 read request unit.

<sup>3</sup>  Each `setAlarm` is billed as a single write request unit.

<sup>4</sup>  Delete requests are unmetered. For example, deleting a 100 KB value will be charged one delete request.

<sup>5</sup>  Durable Objects will be billed for stored data until the data is removed. Once the data is removed, the object will be cleaned up automatically by the system.

Requests that hit the [Durable Objects in-memory cache](/durable-objects/reference/in-memory-state/) or that use the [multi-key versions of `get()`/`put()`/`delete()` methods](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) are billed the same as if they were a normal, individual request for each key.

### SQLite storage backend

:::note[SQLite in Durable Objects Beta]

The new beta version of Durable Objects is available where each Durable Object has a private, embedded SQLite database. When deploying a new Durable Object class, users can [opt-in to a SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sqlite-storage-backend) in order to access new [SQL API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sqlexec).

During the initial beta, Storage API billing is not enabled for Durable Object classes using SQLite storage backend. SQLite-backed Durable Objects will incur [charges for requests and duration](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#billing-metrics). We plan to enable Storage API billing for Durable Objects using SQLite storage backend in the first half of 2025 after advance notice with the below pricing.

You can introspect rows read and rows written using `cursor.rowsRead` and `cursor.rowsWritten` on the [cursor returned](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#returns) by a SQL query and using [GraphQL analytics](/durable-objects/observability/graphql-analytics/#query-via-the-graphql-api). [`ctx.storage.sql.databaseSize`](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sqldatabaseSize) returns the current SQL database size for a Durable Object.

:::

For [Durable Objects classes with SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/#enable-sqlite-storage-backend-on-create-durable-object-class-migration) via `ctx.storage.sql` the following pricing is used instead:

|                             | Workers Paid plan          |
| ----------------------------| -------------------------- |
| Rows reads <sup>1,2</sup>   | First 25 billion / month included + $0.001 / million rows |
| Rows written <sup>1,2</sup> | First 50 million / month included + $1.00 / million rows |
| SQL Stored data             | 5 GB-month, + $0.20/ GB-month |

<sup>1</sup> Rows read and rows written included limits and rates match D1, Cloudflare's serverless SQL database, [pricing](/d1/platform/pricing/).

<sup>2</sup> Key-value methods like `get()`, `put()`, `delete()`, or `list()` store and query data in a hidden SQLite table and are billed as rows read and rows written.

<sup>3</sup>  Each `setAlarm` is billed as a single row written.
