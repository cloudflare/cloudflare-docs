:::note


Cloudflare Queues requires the [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) to use, but does not increase your monthly subscription cost.


:::

Cloudflare Queues charges for the total number of operations against each of your queues during a given month.

* An operation is counted for each 64 KB of data that is written, read, or deleted.
* Messages larger than 64 KB are charged as if they were multiple messages: for example, a 65 KB message and a 127 KB message would both incur two operation charges when written, read, or deleted.
* A KB is defined as 1,000 bytes, and each message includes approximately 100 bytes of internal metadata.
* Operations are per message, not per batch. A batch of 10 messages (the default batch size), if processed, would incur 10x write, 10x read, and 10x delete operations: one for each message in the batch.
* There are no data transfer (egress) or throughput (bandwidth) charges.

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard operations | 1,000,000 operations/month included + $0.40/million operations |

In most cases, it takes 3 operations to deliver a message: 1 write, 1 read, and 1 delete. Therefore, you can use the following formula to estimate your monthly bill:

```txt
((Number of Messages * 3) - 1,000,000) / 1,000,000  * $0.40
```

Additionally:

* Each retry incurs a read operation. A batch of 10 messages that is retried would incur 10 operations for each retry.
* Messages that reach the maximum retries and that are written to a [Dead Letter Queue](/queues/configuration/batching-retries/) incur a write operation for each 64 KB chunk. A message that was retried 3 times (the default), fails delivery on the fourth time and is written to a Dead Letter Queue would incur five (5) read operations.
* Messages that are written to a queue, but that reach the maximum persistence duration (or "expire") before they are read, incur only a write and delete operation per 64 KB chunk.
