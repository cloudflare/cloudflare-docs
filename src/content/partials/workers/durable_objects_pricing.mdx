[Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) are only available on the [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers).

<sup>1</sup> Each [RPC session](/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle/) is billed
as one request to your Durable Object. Every [RPC method
call](/durable-objects/best-practices/create-durable-object-stubs-and-send-requests/)
on a [Durable Objects stub](/durable-objects/) is its own RPC session and
therefore a single billed request.

RPC method calls can return objects (stubs) extending [`RpcTarget`](/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle/#lifetimes-memory-and-resource-management) and invoke calls on those stubs. Subsequent calls on the returned stub are part of the same RPC session and are not billed as separate requests. For example:

```js
let durableObjectStub = OBJECT_NAMESPACE.get(id); // retrieve Durable Object stub
using foo = await durableObjectStub.bar(); // billed as a request
await foo.baz(); // treated as part of the same RPC session created by calling bar(), not billed as a request
await durableObjectStub.cat(); // billed as a request
```

<sup>2</sup> A request is needed to create a WebSocket connection. There is no
charge for outgoing WebSocket messages, nor for incoming [WebSocket protocol
pings](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.5.2). For compute
requests billing-only, a 20:1 ratio is applied to incoming WebSocket messages to
factor in smaller messages for real-time communication. For example, 100
WebSocket incoming messages would be charged as 5 requests for billing purposes.
The 20:1 ratio does not affect Durable Object metrics and analytics, which
reflect actual usage.

<sup>3</sup> Application level auto-response messages handled by
[`state.setWebSocketAutoResponse()`](/durable-objects/api/websockets/) will not
incur additional wall-clock time, and so they will not be charged.

<sup>4</sup> Duration is billed in wall-clock time as long as the Object is
active, but is shared across all requests active on an Object at once. Once your
Object finishes responding to all requests, it will stop incurring duration
charges. Calling `accept()` on a WebSocket in an Object will incur duration
charges for the entire time the WebSocket is connected. If you prefer, use
[`state.acceptWebSocket()`](/durable-objects/api/websockets/#state-methods-for-websockets)
instead, which will stop incurring duration charges once all event handlers
finish running.

<sup>5</sup> Duration billing charges for the 128 MB of memory your Durable
Object is allocated, regardless of actual usage. If your account creates many
instances of a single Durable Object class, Durable Objects may run in the same
isolate on the same physical machine and share the 128 MB of memory. These
Durable Objects are still billed as if they are allocated a full 128 MB of
memory.
