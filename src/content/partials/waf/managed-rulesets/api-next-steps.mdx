### Next steps

To configure the {props.rulesetName} via API, create [overrides](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) using the Rulesets API. You can perform the following configurations:

- Specify the action to perform for all the rules in the ruleset by creating a ruleset override.
- Disable or customize the action of individual rules by creating rule overrides for those rules.

For examples of creating overrides using the API, refer to [Override a managed ruleset](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).
