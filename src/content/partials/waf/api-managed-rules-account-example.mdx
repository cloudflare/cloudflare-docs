import { RuleID } from "~/components";

The following example deploys a [WAF managed ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase of a given account (`{account_id}`) by creating a rule that executes the managed ruleset. The rules in the managed ruleset are executed when the zone name matches one of `example.com` or `anotherexample.com`.

1.  Invoke the [Get an account entry point ruleset](/api/operations/getAccountEntrypointRuleset) operation to obtain the definition of the entry point ruleset for the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase. You will need the [account ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/) for this task.

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
    ```

    ```json output {4}
    {
    	"result": {
    		"description": "Account-level phase entry point",
    		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
    		"kind": "root",
    		"last_updated": "2024-03-16T15:40:08.202335Z",
    		"name": "root",
    		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed",
    		"rules": [
    			// ...
    		],
    		"source": "firewall_managed",
    		"version": "10"
    	},
    	"success": true,
    	"errors": [],
    	"messages": []
    }
    ```

2.  If the entry point ruleset already exists (that is, if you received a `200 OK` status code and the ruleset definition), take note of the ruleset ID in the response. Then, invoke the [Create an account ruleset rule](/api/operations/createAccountRulesetRule) operation to add an `execute` rule to the existing ruleset deploying the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) (with ID <RuleID id="efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee" />). By default, the rule will be added at the end of the list of rules already in the ruleset.

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
    	"action": "execute",
    	"action_parameters": {
    		"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee"
    	},
    	"expression": "(cf.zone.name in {\"example.com\" \"anotherexample.com\"}) and cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",
    	"description": "Execute the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset"
    }'
    ```

    ```json output
    {
    	"result": {
    		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
    		"name": "Account-level phase entry point",
    		"description": "",
    		"kind": "root",
    		"version": "11",
    		"rules": [
    			// ... any existing rules
    			{
    				"id": "<RULE_ID>",
    				"version": "1",
    				"action": "execute",
    				"action_parameters": {
    					"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",
    					"version": "latest"
    				},
    				"expression": "(cf.zone.name in {\"example.com\" \"anotherexample.com\"}) and cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",
    				"description": "Execute the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset",
    				"last_updated": "2024-03-18T18:30:08.122758Z",
    				"ref": "<RULE_REF>",
    				"enabled": true
    			}
    		],
    		"last_updated": "2024-03-18T18:30:08.122758Z",
    		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
    	},
    	"success": true,
    	"errors": [],
    	"messages": []
    }
    ```

3.  If the entry point ruleset does not exist (that is, if you received a `404 Not Found` status code in step 1), create the ruleset using the [Create an account ruleset](/api/operations/createAccountRuleset) operation. Include a single rule in the `rules` array that executes the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (with ID <RuleID id="efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee" />) for all incoming requests where the zone name matches one of `example.com` or `anotherexample.com`.

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "name": "My ruleset",
      "description": "Entry point ruleset for WAF managed rulesets",
      "kind": "root",
      "phase": "http_request_firewall_managed",
      "rules": [
        {
          "action": "execute",
          "action_parameters": {
            "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee"
          },
          "expression": "(cf.zone.name in {\"example.com\" \"anotherexample.com\"}) and cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",
          "description": "Execute the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```

    :::caution
    Managed rulesets deployed at the account level will only apply to incoming traffic of zones on an Enterprise plan. The expression of your `execute` rule must end with `and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` or else the API operation will fail.
