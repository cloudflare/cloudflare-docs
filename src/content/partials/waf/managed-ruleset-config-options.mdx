## Customize the behavior of managed rulesets

To customize the behavior of managed rulesets, do one of the following:

- [Create exceptions](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/) to skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules under certain conditions.
- <a href={props.overridesUrl}>Configure overrides</a> to change the rule action
  or disable one or more rules of managed rulesets. Overrides can affect an
  entire managed ruleset, specific tags, or specific rules in the managed
  ruleset.

Exceptions have priority over overrides.
