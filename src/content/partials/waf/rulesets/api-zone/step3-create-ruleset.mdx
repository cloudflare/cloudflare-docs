If the entry point ruleset does not exist (that is, if you received a `404 Not Found` status code in step 1), create it using the [Create a zone ruleset](/api/operations/createZoneRuleset) operation. Include a single rule in the `rules` array that executes the <Markdown text={props.deploymentItem} /> for <Markdown text={props.scope} />.
