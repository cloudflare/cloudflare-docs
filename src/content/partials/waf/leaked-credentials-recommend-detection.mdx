:::note[Recommendation: Use leaked credentials detection instead]
Cloudflare recommends that you use [leaked credentials detection](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) instead of Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check, which refers to a previous implementation.<br/>
For more information on migrating your Exposed Credentials Check configuration, refer to the [migration guide](/waf/reference/migration-guides/exposed-credentials-check-migration/).
