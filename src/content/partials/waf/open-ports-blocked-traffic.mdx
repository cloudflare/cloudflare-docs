Due to the nature of Cloudflare's anycast network, ports other than `80` and `443` will be open so that Cloudflare can serve traffic for other customers on these ports. In general, Cloudflare makes available several different products on [Cloudflare IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips), so you can expect tools like Netcat and security scanners to report these non-standard ports as open in specific conditions. If you have questions on security compliance, review [Cloudflare's certifications and compliance resources](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/trust-hub/compliance-resources/) and contact your Cloudflare enterprise account manager for more information.
