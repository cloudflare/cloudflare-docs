[^1]: Cloudflare primarily detects VPN traffic that passes through our public resolver at 1.1.1.1. Additionally, Cloudflare can identify major VPNs based on their published IP addresses. Managed Lists for VPNs allow you to block these categories of detected VPNs. However, it's important to clarify that Cloudflare does not detect and block all VPNs at this time. Cloudflare is continually working to improve our detection capabilities and expand our coverage to include a wider range of VPN services.
