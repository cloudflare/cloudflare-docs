To define a specific position for the new rule, include a `position` object in the request body according to the guidelines in [Change the order of a rule in a ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update-rule/#change-the-order-of-a-rule-in-a-ruleset).

For instructions on creating an entry point ruleset and defining its rules using a single API call, refer to [Add rules to phase entry point rulesets](/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/add-rule-phase-rulesets/).
