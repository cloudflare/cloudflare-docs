## Threat score

The threat score measures IP reputation across Cloudflare services. This score is calculated based on [Project Honeypot](https://www.projecthoneypot.org/), external public IP information, as well as internal threat intelligence from our [WAF managed rules](/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/) and [DDoS](/ddos-protection/about/).

The threat score of a request has a value from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates low risk. Values above 10 may represent spammers or bots, and values above 40 identify bad actors on the Internet.

## Security levels

Security levels are based on the threat score (except *Off* and *I’m Under Attack!*). You can adjust the security level to challenge incoming requests based on the threat they pose.

The available security levels are the following:



| Security Level                      | Threat score range | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Off (Enterprise<br/>customers only) | *N/A*              | Does not challenge IP addresses.                                                     |
| Essentially off                     | 50–100             | Only challenges IP addresses with the worst reputation.                              |
| Low                                 | 25–100             | Challenges only threatening visitors.                                                |
| Medium                              | 15–100             | Challenges both threatening and moderately threatening visitors.                     |
| High                                | 0–100              | Challenges all visitors that exhibited threatening behavior within the last 14 days. |
| I’m Under Attack!                   | *N/A*              | Only for use if your website is currently under a DDoS attack.                       |



Selecting a higher **Security Level** value means that even requests with a lower risk (that is, with a low [threat score](#threat-score)) will be challenged. Selecting a lower **Security Level** value means that only requests posing a higher risk (that is, with a high threat score) will be challenged.

Security levels from *Essentially off* to *High* will challenge the visitor using a Managed Challenge. When you select *I'm Under Attack!*, which enables [I'm Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/), Cloudflare will present a JS challenge page.

:::caution

Only use [I'm Under Attack mode](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/) when a website is under a DDoS attack. I'm Under Attack mode may affect some actions on your domain, such as your API traffic.

To set a custom security level for your API or any other part of your domain, create a [configuration rule](/rules/configuration-rules/).
