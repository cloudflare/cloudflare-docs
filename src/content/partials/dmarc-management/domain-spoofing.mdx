There are several DNS mechanisms to prevent others from sending emails on behalf of your domain. These all work as TXT records that need to be added on your domain:

* [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/): List authorized IP addresses and domains that can send email on behalf of your domain.
* [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/): Ensure email authenticity by cryptographically signing emails.
* [Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/): Receive aggregate reports about your email traffic and provide clear instructions for how email receivers should treat non-conforming emails.
