{props.shippedLanguage}, and will only establish a connection to the Cloudflare network when it is activated. Cloudflare recommends leaving it deactivated until you finish [setting it up in the dashboard](#1-create-a-site).

When the Connector is first activated, one of the ports must be connected to the Internet through a device that supports DHCP. This is required so that the Connector can reach the Cloudflare global network and download the required configurations that you set up in the [site configuration](#1-create-a-site) step.

:::caution
Remember to connect Magic WAN Connector through a route that supports DHCP for its first connection to the Internet. Otherwise, the Connector will not work.
:::

When you are ready to connect your Magic WAN Connector to the Cloudflare network:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Configuration** > **Connectors**.
3. Find the Connector you want to activate, select the three dots next to it > **Edit**. Make sure you verify the serial number to choose the right connector you want to activate.
4. In the new window, the **Status** dropdown will show as **Deactivated**. Select it to change the status to **Activated**.
5. The **Interrupt window** is the time period when the Magic WAN Connector software can update, which may result in interruption to existing connections. Choose a time period to minimize disruption to your sites. Refer to [Interrupt window](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/maintenance/interrupt-service-window/) for more details on how to define when the Connector can update its systems.
6. Select **Update**.
