You can install up to two Magic WAN Connectors for redundancy at each of your sites. If one of your Connectors fail, traffic will fail over to the other Connector ensuring that you never lose connectivity to that site.

In this type of high availability (HA) configuration, you will choose a reliable LAN interface as the HA link which will be used to monitor the health of the peer connector. HA links can be dedicated links or can be shared with other LAN traffic.

You must decide the type of configuration you want for your site from the beginning: no redundancy or with redundancy. You cannot add redundancy after finishing configuring your dashboard settings. If, at a later stage, you decide to enable redundancy, you will need to delete your site configuration in the Cloudflare dashboard, and start again.

<Card title="Do you need a high availability configuration?" icon="information">

- If you need a high availability configuration for your premises, refer to
  [About high availability configurations](#about-high-availability-configurations) for more information
  and learn how to configure your Connector in this mode.

- If you do not need a high availability configuration for you premises, proceed to [Set up Cloudflare dashboard](#set-up-cloudflare-dashboard).

</Card>

:::caution
You cannot enable high availability for an existing site. To add high availability to an existing site in the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to delete the site and start again. Plan accordingly to create a high availability configuration from the start if needed.
