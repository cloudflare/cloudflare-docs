import { Markdown } from "~/components"

<br /> {props.one}

To avoid double encapsulation of WARP traffic:

1. Follow the steps in <Markdown text={props.two} /> until **step 5**.
2. Search for `WARP`, and select **Add application**.

WARP traffic will now be sent directly to the Internet. However, you may need to configure your firewall to allow this new traffic.

### Firewall configuration

After enabling WARP traffic to go directly to the Internet, you may need to update your firewall configuration to allow this new traffic. Make sure to allow the following IPs and ports:

- **Destination IPs**: `162.159.193.0/24`, `162.159.197.0/24`
- **Destination ports**: `443`, `500`, `1701`, `2408`, `4443`, `4500`, `8095`, `844`
