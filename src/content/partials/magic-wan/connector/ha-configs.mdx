## About high availability configurations

When you set up a site in high availability, the WANs and LANs in your Connectors have the same configuration but are replicated on two nodes. In case of failure of a Connector, the other Connector becomes the active node, taking over configuration of the LAN gateway IP and allowing traffic to continue without disruption.

Because Connectors in high availability configurations share a single site, you need to set up:

- **Static address**: The IP for the primary node in your site.
- **Secondary static address**: The IP for the secondary node in your site.
- **Virtual static address**: The IP that the LAN south of the Connector will forward traffic to, which is the LAN's gateway IP.

Make sure all IPs are part of the same subnet.

:::note

- Failure conditions include Connector down or software restart, LAN or WAN link down, tunnel health down.
- High availability (HA) is run in non-preempt mode, which means either the primary or the secondary node can come up as active through an election process which includes node health parameters.
- In the case of a failover where a Connector is acting as a DHCP server, DHCP leases will be synchronized.

### ​​Create a high availability configuration

You cannot enable high availability for an existing site. To add high availability to an existing site in the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to delete the site and start again.

To set up a high availability configuration:

1. Follow the steps in [Create a site](#1-create-a-site) up until step 4.
2. After naming your site, select **Enable high availability**.
3. Under **Connector**, select **Add Connector**.
4. From the list, choose your first Connector > **Add Connector**.
5. Back on the previous screen, select **Add secondary Connector**.
6. From the list, choose your second Connector > **Add Connector**.
7. Select **Next** to [Create a WAN](#2-create-a-wan). If you are configuring a static IP, configure the IP for the primary node as the static address, and the IP for the secondary node as the secondary static address.
8. To create a LAN, follow the steps mentioned above in [Create a LAN](#3-create-a-lan) up until step 4.
9. In **Static address**, enter the IP for the primary node in your site. For example, `192.168.10.1/24`.
10. In **Secondary static address**, enter the IP for the secondary node in your site. For example, `192.168.10.2/24`.
11. In **Virtual static address**, enter the IP that the LAN south of the Connector will forward traffic to. For example, `192.168.10.3/24`.
12. Select **Save**.
13. From the **High availability probing link** drop-down menu, select the port that should be used to monitor the node's health. Cloudflare recommends you choose a reliable interface as the HA probing link. The primary and secondary node's probing link should be connected over a switch, and cannot be a direct connection.
