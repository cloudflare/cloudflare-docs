Magic WAN clients connecting through [GRE](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/), [IPsec](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/), [CNI](/network-interconnect/) or [WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/) that want to perform a `traceroute` to an endpoint behind a [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) will need to change some settings to make the command useful. Refer to [Run `traceroute`](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/traceroute/) for more information.
