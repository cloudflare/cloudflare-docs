The MSS value depends on how your network is set up.

- **On your Edge router**: Apply the clamp to the GRE tunnel internal interface (meaning where the egress traffic will traverse). The MSS clamp should be 1,436 bytes. This may be done automatically once the tunnel is configured, but it depends on your devices.
