## Before transferring a domain to Cloudflare

* Create [a Cloudflare account](/fundamentals/setup/account/create-account/).
* [Add the domain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) you are transferring to your Cloudflare account.
* [Review your DNS records](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#review-dns-records) in the Cloudflare dashboard.
* [Change your DNS nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) to Cloudflare.
* If initiating multiple transfers, notify your financial institution to prevent them from flagging these charges as fraudulent.
* Renew your domain if it is within 15 days of expiration.
* Unlock your domain at your current registrar.
* Do not make any changes to the Registrant contact information. Updating the Registrant contact may result in your current registrar locking the domain for 60 days.
* Make sure your account has a valid credit card on file.
* If you are transferring a `.us` domain, refer to the [Additional requirements for .US domains](/registrar/top-level-domains/us-domains/) before proceeding.
