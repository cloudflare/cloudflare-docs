## Requirements

All domains using Cloudflare Registrar must use Cloudflare DNS on a [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/)[^1]. This also means that you cannot change to another DNS provider while using Cloudflare Registrar.

[^1]: Meaning Cloudflare is your primary, authoritative DNS provider.
