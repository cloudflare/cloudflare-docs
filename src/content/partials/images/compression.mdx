Slightly reduces latency on a cache miss by selecting a quickest-to-compress file format, at a cost of increased file size and lower image quality. It will usually override the `format` option and choose JPEG over WebP or AVIF. We do not recommend using this option, except in unusual circumstances like resizing uncacheable dynamically-generated images.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="URL format">
    ```js 
    compression=fast
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Workers">
  ```js 
  cf: {image: {compression: "fast"}}
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
