When cropping with `fit: "cover"` and `fit: "crop"`, this parameter defines the side or point that should not be cropped. Available options are:

* `auto`\
  Selects focal point based on saliency detection (using maximum symmetric surround algorithm).

    ```

  <TabItem label="Workers">
  ```js

  ```
  </TabItem>

* `side`\
  A side (`"left"`, `"right"`, `"top"`, `"bottom"`) or coordinates specified on a scale from `0.0` (top or left) to `1.0` (bottom or right), `0.5` being the center. The X and Y coordinates are separated by lowercase `x` in the URL format. For example, `0x1` means left and bottom, `0.5x0.5` is the center, `0.5x0.33` is a point in the top third of the image.

  For the Workers integration, use an object `{x, y}` to specify coordinates. It contains focal point coordinates in the original image expressed as fractions ranging from `0.0` (top or left) to `1.0` (bottom or right), with `0.5` being the center. `{fit: "cover", gravity: {x:0.5, y:0.2}}` will crop each side to preserve as much as possible around a point at 20% of the height of the source image.

:::note
You must subtract the height of the image before you calculate the focal point.
