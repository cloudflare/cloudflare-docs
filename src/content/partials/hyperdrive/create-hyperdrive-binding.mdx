You must create a binding for your Worker to connect to your Hyperdrive configuration. [Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to access resources, like D1, on the Cloudflare developer platform. You create bindings by updating your `wrangler.toml` file.

To bind your Hyperdrive configuration to your Worker, add the following to the end of your `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>" # the ID associated with the Hyperdrive you just created
```

Specifically:

- The value (string) you set for the `name` (binding name) will be used to reference this database in your Worker. In this tutorial, name your binding `HYPERDRIVE`.
- The binding must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "hyperdrive"` or `binding = "productionDB"` would both be valid names for the binding.
- Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<BINDING_NAME>`.
