Email Security (formerly Area 1) uses a variety of factors to determine whether a given email message, a web domain or URL, or specific network traffic is part of a <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phishing</GlossaryTooltip> campaign (marked with a `Malicious` <GlossaryTooltip term="disposition" link="/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/">disposition</GlossaryTooltip>) or other common campaigns (for example, `Spam`).

These small pattern assessments are dynamic in nature and — in many cases — no single one in and of itself will determine the final verdict. Instead, our automated systems use a combination of factors and non-factors to clearly distinguish between a valid phishing campaign and benign traffic.

## ActiveSensors

ActiveSensors is a proprietary sensor network that discovers emergent campaign infrastructure, and aggregates attack data from relay points that actors use to launch their threat campaign. Cloudflare's [Network](/products/?product-group=Network+security) and [Application Security](/products/?product-group=Application+security) provide early detection on phishing attacks, malware, URLs, domains, IPs, and ASNs from across the Internet.

ActiveSensors does the following:

* Infrastructure monitoring, clustering and correlation.
* User and target impersonation-based crawls.
* Machine learning based link analysis and content detection.
* Payload analysis, in-the-wild sandboxing, content denotation, and reconstruction.

## SPARSE (Small Pattern Analytics Engine)

SPARSE is a proprietary analytics engine which determines targeted attacks. SPARSE uses the ActiveSensors network, our 8+ petabyte data warehouse, and AI and ML models to make effective detections with a limited data set.

## IP reputation

IP reputation is just one of many factors to consider but is not consistently accurate due to the dynamic nature of phishing campaigns.

For example, a particular sender IP in a Comcast range might have a mix of good and bad reputation. Flagging it purely on IP would subject a larger chunk of Comcast's IP address range to detections which could lead to false positives.
