With an **Inline deployment** for your [Email Security (formerly Area 1) setup](/email-security/deployment/), Email Security evaluates email messages before they reach a user's inbox.

More technically, Email Security becomes a hop in the <GlossaryTooltip term="SMTP">SMTP</GlossaryTooltip> processing chain and physically interacts with incoming email messages. Based on your policies, various messages are blocked before reaching the inbox.

## Benefits

When you choose an inline deployment, you get the following benefits:

* Messages are processed and physically blocked before delivery to a user's mailbox.
* Your deployment is simpler, because any complex processing can happen downstream and without modification.
* Email Security can [modify delivered messages](/email-security/email-configuration/email-policies/text-addons/), adding subject or body mark-ups.
* Email Security can offer high availability and adaptive message pooling.
* You can set up advanced handling downstream for non-quarantined messages with [added `X-headers`](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

## Limitations

Inline deployments are not without their disadvantages. If you deploy Email Security as your MX record, you will have to make changes to your DNS. If not — and you deploy Email Security after your MX record — you will have a more complex SMTP architecture.

Additionally, this setup may require policy duplication on multiple solutions and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
