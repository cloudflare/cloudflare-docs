You first need to configure the domains you are onboarding on the Email Security (formerly Area 1) dashboard. To configure your domains:

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Email configuration** > **Domains & Routing** > **Domains**.
4. Make sure each domain you are onboarding has been added.
5. For each domain you are configuring, select **...** > **Edit**, and set the following options:
   * **Domain** - `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`.
   * **Configured as** - `MX Records`.
   * **Forwarding to** - This should match the expected MX record for each domain in your [Office 365 account](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/Domains/).
   * **IP Restrictions** - Leave this field empty.
   * **Outbound TLS** - `Forward all messages over TLS`.
   * **Quarantine Policy** - {props.one}
