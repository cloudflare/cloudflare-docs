When you configure Email Security (formerly Area 1) Email Security to protect your organization, you can choose between two main setup architectures: Inline and API.

With an Inline deployment, Cloud Email Security evaluates email messages before they reach a user’s inbox. When you choose an API deployment, email messages only reach Cloud Email Security after they have already reached a user’s inbox.
