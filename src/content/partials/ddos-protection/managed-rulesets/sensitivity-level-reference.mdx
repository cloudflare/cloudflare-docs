API property name: `"sensitivity_level"`.

Defines how sensitive a rule is. Affects the thresholds used to determine if an attack should be mitigated. A higher sensitivity level means having a lower threshold, while a lower sensitivity level means having a higher threshold.

The available sensitivity levels are:

| UI value          | API value   |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| *High*            | `"default"` |
| *Medium*          | `"medium"`  |
| *Low*             | `"low"`     |
| *Essentially Off* | `"eoff"`    |

The default sensitivity level is *High*.

In most cases, when you select the *Essentially Off* sensitivity level the rule will not trigger for any of the selected actions, including *Log*. However, if the attack is extremely large, Cloudflare's protection systems will still trigger the rule's mitigation action to protect Cloudflare's network.
