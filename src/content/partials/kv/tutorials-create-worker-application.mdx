To get started, create a Worker application using the [`create-cloudflare` CLI](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare). Open a terminal window and run the following command:

```sh
$ npm create cloudflare@latest -y
```

* Enter `$1` for your application name.
* Select `"Hello World" Worker` for the type of application.
* Select `Yes` to use TypeScript.
* Select `Yes` to initialize a git repository.
* Choose `No` when asked if you want to deploy your application (this will be done in a later step).
