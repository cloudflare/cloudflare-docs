When you [add records to Cloudflare DNS](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/), those records should be [DNS-only (unproxied)](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#dns-only-records) until {props.one} verifies your domain. Then, you can switch your DNS records to **Proxied**.
