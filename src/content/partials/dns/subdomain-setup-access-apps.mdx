To use subdomain setups with [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/), note that:

- If the child zone is in a pending state when you create the Access application, your configuration will not automatically apply when you activate the zone. You must also re-save the Access application once your subdomain setup is active.

- If you split out a subdomain which already has an Access application, you will also need to re-save the Access application to associate it with the new child zone.
