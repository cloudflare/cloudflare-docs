#### Proxy eligibility

By default, `A`, `AAAA`, and `CNAME` DNS records that serve `HTTP/HTTPS` traffic can be proxied.

If you encounter a `CNAME` record that you cannot proxy — usually associated with another CDN provider — a proxied version of that record will cause connectivity errors. Cloudflare is purposely preventing that record from being proxied to protect you from a misconfiguration.

The following types of DNS records may be in your DNS configuration, but cannot be proxied:

* `CAA`
* `DKIM`
* `DMARC`
* `DNSKEY`
* `DS`
* `HTTPS`
* `MX`
* `NS`
* `PTR`
* `SOA`
* `SPF`
* `SRV`
* `SVCB`
* `TXT`

#### Ports and protocols

To proxy `HTTP/HTTPS` traffic on [non-standard ports](/fundamentals/reference/network-ports/) or to proxy a `TCP-` or `UDP-` based application, use [Cloudflare Spectrum](/spectrum/).

#### Pending domains

<Render file="onboard-warning" product="dns" /> <br/>

This means that DNS records - even those set to [proxy traffic through Cloudflare](#proxied-records) -- will be [DNS-only](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#dns-only-records) until your zone has been activated and any requests to your DNS records will return your origin server's IP address.

If this warning is still present after 24 hours, refer to [Troubleshooting](/dns/troubleshooting/).

For enhanced security, we recommend rolling your origin IP addresses at your hosting provider after your zone has been activated. This action prevents your origin IPs from being leaked during onboarding.

#### Windows authentication

Because Microsoft Integrated Windows Authentication, NTLM, and Kerberos violate HTTP/1.1 specifications, they are not compatible with proxied DNS records.
