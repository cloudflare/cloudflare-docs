Most subdomains serve a specific purpose within the overall context of your website. For example, `blog.example.com` might be your blog, `support.example.com` could be your customer help portal, and `store.example.com` would be your e-commerce site.

## Subdomain records

To create a new subdomain, you would first add the subdomain content at your [host](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/#host-your-domain).

Then, you would create a corresponding [IP address resolution record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) (`A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME`), specifying the subdomain (`blog`, `www`, or `store`, for example) as the record **Name**.

<Example>

| Type | Name  | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A    | `blog` | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

</Example>
