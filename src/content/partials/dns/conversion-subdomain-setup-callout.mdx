:::caution[Subdomain setup]
If you also use subdomain setup[^1], consider the [available combinations](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/#available-setups) and whether your zone conversion could have any implications.
:::

[^1]: Meaning you have one or more subdomains (`sub.example.com`) added to Cloudflare as their own zone, separate from your apex domain (`example.com`).
