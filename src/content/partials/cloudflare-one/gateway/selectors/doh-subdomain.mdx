Use this selector to match against DNS queries that arrive via DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) destined for the DoH endpoint configured for each DNS location. For example, you can use a DNS location with a DoH endpoint of `abcdefg.cloudflare-gateway.com` by choosing the DoH Subdomain selector and inputting a value of `abcdefg`.
