## Block unauthorized applications

To minimize the risk of <GlossaryTooltip term="shadow IT" link="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-shadow-it/">shadow IT</GlossaryTooltip>, some organizations choose to limit their users' access to certain web-based tools and applications. For example, the following policy blocks AI assistants:

| Selector    | Operator | Value                                           | Action |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Application | in       | *Microsoft Copilot*, *ChatGPT*, *Google Gemini* | Block  |

:::note

After seven days, view your [shadow IT analytics](/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/access/) and block additional applications based on what your users are accessing.
