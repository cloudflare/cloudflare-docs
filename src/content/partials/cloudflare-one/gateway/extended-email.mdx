Extended email addresses (also known as plus addresses) are variants of an existing email address with `+` or `.` modifiers. Many email providers, such as Gmail and Outlook, deliver emails intended for an extended address to its original address. For example, providers will deliver emails sent to `contact+123@example.com` or `con.tact@example.com` to `contact@example.com`.

By default, Gateway will either filter only exact matches or all extended variants depending on the type of policy and action used:
