3. Next, go to **Access** > **Applications**.
4. Choose a [self-hosted application](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) and select **Configure**.
5. Choose an [Allow policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) and select **Configure**.
6. Under **Additional settings**, turn on **Isolate application**.
7. Save the policy.

Browser Isolation is now enabled for users who match this policy. After the user logs into Access, the application will launch in a remote browser. To confirm that the application is isolated, refer to [Check if a web page is isolated](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/#3-check-if-a-web-page-is-isolated).

You can optionally add another Allow policy for users on managed devices who do not require isolation.
