1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.

2. Select **Add an application**.

3. Select **Self-hosted**.

4. Enter any name for the application.

5. In **Session Duration**, choose how often the user's [application token](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/application-token/) should expire.

   Cloudflare checks every HTTP request to your application for a valid application token. If the user's application token (and global token) has expired, they will be prompted to reauthenticate with the IdP. For more information, refer to [Session management](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/session-management/).

6. In **Application domain**, enter the domains that will represent the application.

   * Domains must belong to an active zone in your Cloudflare account. You can either select a domain from the dropdown or enter a [custom domain](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/secure-with-access/) that you control.
   * You can use [wildcards](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/app-paths/) to protect multiple parts of an application that share a root path.

7. (Optional) Configure [App Launcher settings](/cloudflare-one/applications/app-launcher/) for the application.
