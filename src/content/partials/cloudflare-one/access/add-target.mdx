A target represents a single resource in your infrastructure (such as a server, Kubernetes cluster, database, or container) that users will connect to through Cloudflare. Targets are protocol-agnostic, meaning that you do not need to define a new target for each protocol that runs on the server.

To create a new target:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Dashboard">
1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Network** > **Targets**.
2. Select **Add a target**.
3. In **Target hostname**, enter a user-friendly name for the target resource. We recommend using the server hostname, for example `production-server`. The hostname does not need to be unique and can be reused for multiple targets.
	<Details header="Format restrictions">
			- Case insensitive
			- Contain no more than 255 characters
			- Contain only alphanumeric characters, `-`, or `.` (no spaces allowed)
			- Start and end with an alphanumeric character
	</Details>
4. In **IP addresses**, enter the private IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the target resource. If the IP address overlaps across multiple private networks, select the [virtual network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/) where the resource is located.
:::note[IP address requirements]
- Public IPs are not currently supported.
- The IP address must be reachable through Cloudflare Tunnel.
- You must input the full IP address. The selector in the UI does not do partial matches.
:::
5. Select **Add target**.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="API">

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/infrastructure/targets \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--data '{
  "hostname": "infra-access-target",
  "ip": {
    "ipv4": {
      "ip_addr": "187.26.29.249",
      "virtual_network_id": "c77b744e-acc8-428f-9257-6878c046ed55"
    },
    "ipv6": {
      "ip_addr": "64c0:64e8:f0b4:8dbf:7104:72b0:ec8f:f5e0",
      "virtual_network_id": "c77b744e-acc8-428f-9257-6878c046ed55"
    }
  }
}'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, create an infrastructure application to secure the target.
