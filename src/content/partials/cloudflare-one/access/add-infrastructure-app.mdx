1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Access** > **Applications**.
2. Select **Add an application**.
3. Select **Infrastructure**.
4. Enter any name for the application.
5. In **Target criteria**, select the target hostname(s) that will represent the application. The application definition will apply to all targets that share the selected hostname, including any targets added in the future.
6. Enter the **Protocol** and **Port** that will be used to connect to the server.
7. (Optional) If a protocol runs on more than one port, select **Add new target criteria** and reconfigure the same target hostname and protocol with a different port number.
	:::note
	Access for Infrastructure only supports assigning one protocol per port. You can reuse a port/protocol pairing across infrastructure applications, but the port cannot be reassigned to another protocol.
	:::
8. Select **Next**.
9. To secure your targets, configure a policy that defines who can connect and how they can connect:
	1. Enter any name for your policy.
	2. Create a rule that matches the users who are allowed to reach the targets. For more information, refer to [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) and review the list of [infrastructure policy selectors](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/#infrastructure-policy-selectors).
	3. In **Connection context**, enter the UNIX usernames that users can log in as (for example, `root` or `ec2-user`).
4. Select **Add application**.

<TabItem label="API">

1. [Create an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with the following permissions:
		| Type    | Item             | Permission |
		| ------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
		| Account | Access: Apps & Policies  | Edit       |

2. Make a `POST` request to the [Access applications](/api/operations/access-applications-add-an-application) endpoint:

	```sh
	curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/access/apps \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
	--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
	--data '{
		"name": "Example infrastructure app",
		"type": "infrastructure",
		"target_criteria": [
			{
				"target_attributes": {
					"hostname": [
						"infra-access-target"
					]
				},
				"port": 22,
				"protocol": "SSH"
			}
		],

<TabItem label="Terraform">

1. Use the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.44.0/docs/resources/zero_trust_access_application) resource to create an infrastructure application:

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application" "infra-app" {
		account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
		name       = "Example infrastructure app"
		type       = "infrastructure"

		target_criteria {
			port     = 22
			protocol = "SSH"
			target_attributes {
				name = "hostname"
				values = ["infra-access-target"]
			}
		}
	}
	```

2. Use the [`cloudflare_zero_trust_access_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/4.44.0/docs/resources/zero_trust_access_policy) resource to add an infrastructure policy to the application:

	```tf
	resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_access_policy" "infra-app-policy" {
		application_id = cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application.infra-app.id
		account_id = "f037e56e89293a057740de681ac9abbe"
		name       = "Allow a specific email"
		decision   = "allow"
		precedence = 1

		include {
			email = ["jdoe@company.com"]
		}

		connection_rules {
			ssh {
				usernames = ["root", "ec2-user"]
			}
		}
	}
	```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The targets in this application are now secured by your infrastructure policies.

:::note
Gateway [network policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/) take precedence over infrastructure policies. For example, if you block port `22` for all users in Gateway, then no one can SSH over port `22` to your targets.
