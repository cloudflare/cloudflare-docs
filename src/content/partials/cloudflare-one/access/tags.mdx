3. Enter up to 35 alphanumeric characters for the tag (for example, `Human Resources`) and select it in the dropdown menu.
4. Select **Save**.

You can now [add this tag](#tag-an-access-application) to an Access application.

### Tag an Access application

To add a tag to an existing Access application:

2. Select an application and select **Configure**.
3. Select the **Overview** tab.
4. In the **Tags** dropdown, select the tags that you would like to assign to this application. The tag must be [created](#create-a-tag) before you can select it in the dropdown.

The tag will now appear on the application's App Launcher tile.
