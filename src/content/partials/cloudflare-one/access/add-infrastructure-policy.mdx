To secure your targets, configure a policy that defines who can connect and how they can connect:

1. Enter any name for your policy.
2. Create a rule that matches the users who are allowed to reach the targets. For more information, refer to  [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).
3. In **Connection context**, enter the UNIX usernames that users can log in as (for example, `root` or `ec2-user`).
4. Select **Add application**.

The targets in this application are now secured by your infrastructure policies.

:::note
Gateway [network policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/) take precedence over infrastructure policies. For example, if you block port `22` for all users in Gateway, then no one can SSH over port `22` to your targets.
