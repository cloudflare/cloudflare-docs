You can display a custom block page when users fail to authenticate to an Access application. Each application can have a different block page.

:::note

To customize the page that users see when they are blocked by a Gateway firewall policy, refer to [Gateway block page](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/block-page/).

## Create a custom block page

To create a custom block page for Access:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

2. Find the **Access Custom Pages** setting and select **Manage**.

3. Select **Add a page template**.

4. Enter a unique name for the block page.

5. Select **Failed identity provider check**.

6. Copy the **Required script**.

7. In **Custom HTML**, enter the HTML code for your custom page. For example,

   ```html
   <!doctype html>
   <html>
   	<body>
   		<h1>Access denied.</h1>

   		<p>To obtain access, contact your IT administrator.</p>
   	</body>
   </html>
   ```

8. To check the appearance of your custom page, select **Download** and open the HTML file in a browser.

9. Once you are satisfied with your custom page, select **Save**.

You can now select this block page when you [configure an Access application](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/).
