To check for an mTLS certificate:

1. [Add an mTLS certificate](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#add-mtls-authentication-to-your-access-configuration) to your account. You can generate a sample certificate using the [Cloudflare PKI toolkit](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-mtls-using-cloudflare-pki).

2. In **Associated hostnames**, enter your Zero Trust <GlossaryTooltip term="team domain">team domain</GlossaryTooltip>: `<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`

3. In your [device enrollment permissions](#set-device-enrollment-permissions), add a *Common Name* or *Valid Certificate* rule. For example, the following policy requires a client certificate with a specific common name:

   | Action | Rule type | Selector    | Value                |
   | ------ | --------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
   | Allow  | Require   | Common Name | `<CERT-COMMON-NAME>` |

4. On your device, add the client certificate to the [system keychain](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-in-the-browser).
