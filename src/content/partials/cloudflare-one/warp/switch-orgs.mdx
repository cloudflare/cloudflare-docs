To switch to a different organization as a user:

1. Open the WARP client on your device.

2. {props.one}

3. Select **Switch configurations**. The menu will show the organizations that the admin has configured for your device.

4. Select the organization that you want to connect to.

5. If prompted, complete the authentication steps required for the new organization. Your authentication information will be saved and you will be able to switch back and forth between organizations.

:::note

Only admins can [add additional organizations](#mdm-file-format) to the WARP GUI. To connect to an organization that is not displayed in the GUI, go to <strong>{props.two}</strong> to manually log out of the old organization and log into the new organization.
