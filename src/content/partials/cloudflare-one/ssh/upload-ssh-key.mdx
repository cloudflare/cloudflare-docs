To log SSH commands, you will need to generate an HPKE key pair and upload the public key to Cloudflare.

1. [Download](https://github.com/cloudflare/ssh-log-cli/releases/latest/) the Cloudflare `ssh-log-cli` utility.

2. Using the `ssh-log-cli` utility, generate a public and private key pair.

   ```sh
   ./ssh-log-cli generate-key-pair -o sshkey
   ls
   ```

   ```sh output
   README.md    ssh-log-cli    sshkey    sshkey.pub
   ```

   This command outputs two files, an `sshkey.pub` public key and a matching `sshkey` private key.

3. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Network**.

4. In **SSH encryption public key**, paste the contents of `sshkey.pub` and select **Save**. <Markdown text={props.note} />

All proxied SSH commands are immediately encrypted using this public key. The matching private key is required to view logs.
