:::note

Other short-lived CAs, such as those used to [secure SSH servers behind Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/short-lived-certificates-legacy/), are incompatible with the Gateway SSH proxy. For SSH logging to work, you must create a new CA using the `gateway_ca` API endpoint.
