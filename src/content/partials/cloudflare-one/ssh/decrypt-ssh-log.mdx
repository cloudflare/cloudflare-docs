To decrypt the log, follow the instructions in the [SSH Logging CLI repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/ssh-log-cli/). In the following example, `sshkey` is the private key that matches the public key uploaded to Cloudflare.

   ```sh
   ./ssh-log-cli decrypt -i sshlog -k sshkey
   ```

   This command outputs a `sshlog-decrypted.zip` file with the decrypted logs.
