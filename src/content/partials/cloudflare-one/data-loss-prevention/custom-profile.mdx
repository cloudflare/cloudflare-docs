1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DLP** > **DLP Profiles**.

2. Select **Create profile**.

3. Enter a name and optional description for the profile.

4. Add custom or existing detection entries.


   <Details header="Add a custom entry">

   1. Select **Add custom entry** and give it a name.

   2. In **Value**, enter a regular expression (or regex) that defines the text pattern you want to detect. For example, `test\d\d` will detect the word `test` followed by two digits.

      * Regular expressions are written in Rust. We recommend validating your regex with [Rustexp](https://rustexp.lpil.uk/).
      * DLP detects UTF-8 characters, which can be up to 4 bytes each. Custom text pattern detections are limited to 1024 bytes in length.
      * DLP does not support regular expressions with `+` or `*` operators because they are prone to exceeding the length limit. For example, the regex pattern `a+` can detect an infinite number of `a` characters. We recommend using `a{min,max}` instead, such as `a{1,1024}`.

   3. To save the detection entry, select **Done**.

   2. Choose which entries you want to add, then select **Confirm**.
