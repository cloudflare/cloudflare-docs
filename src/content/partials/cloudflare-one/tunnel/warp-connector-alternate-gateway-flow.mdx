When a device on the subnet sends a request, the router will first redirect the traffic to the WARP Connector host. WARP Connector encrypts the traffic, changes its destination IP to the [WARP ingress IP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#warp-ingress-ip), and sends it back to the router. The router will now forward this encrypted traffic to Cloudflare.

:::note

Ensure that your routing rules do not forward the [WARP ingress IP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/#warp-ingress-ip) back to the WARP Connector.
