A dedicated [device profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) allows you to manage the WARP Connector host machine separately from WARP client user devices.

WARP Connector hosts are registered to your Zero Trust organization with the email address `warp_connector@<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`. To set up a device profile for WARP Connector, [create a new profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/#create-a-new-profile) that matches on the following expression:

| Selector | Operator | Value |
| -------- | -------- | ----- |
| User email | is | `warp_connector@<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` |
