1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) and go to **Networks** > **Tunnels**.

2. Select **Create a tunnel**.

3. Choose **Cloudflared** for the connector type and select **Next**.

4. Enter a name for your tunnel. We suggest choosing a name that reflects the type of resources you want to connect through this tunnel (for example, `enterprise-VPC-01`).

5. Select **Save tunnel**.

6. Next, you will need to install `cloudflared` and run it. To do so, check that the environment under **Choose an environment** reflects the operating system on your machine, then copy the command in the box below and paste it into a terminal window. Run the command.

7. Once the command has finished running, your connector will appear in Zero Trust.
