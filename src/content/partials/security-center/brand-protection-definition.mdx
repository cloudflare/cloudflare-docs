Brand Protection gives you the ability to search for new domains that may be attempting to impersonate your brand. Common misspellings (`cloudfalre.com`) and concatenation of services (`cloudflare-okta.com`) are often registered by attackers to trick unsuspecting victims into submitting private information such as passwords. Our system allows you to save search queries that run continuously and alert you if any new domains match those queries.
