Cloudflare threat intelligence data consists of a data exchange between providers and subscribers.

A provider is an organization that has a set of data that they are interested in sharing with other Cloudflare organizations. Any organization can be a provider. Examples of current providers are Government Cyber Defense groups.

Subscribers can be any Cloudflare customer that wants to secure their environment further by creating rules based on provider datasets. Subscribers must be authorized by a provider. Authorization is granted using the [Grant permission to indicator feed endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-add-permission).
