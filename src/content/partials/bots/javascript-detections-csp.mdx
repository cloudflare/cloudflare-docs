If you have a <GlossaryTooltip term="content security policy (CSP)">Content Security Policy (CSP)</GlossaryTooltip>, you need to take additional steps to implement JavaScript detections:

* Ensure that anything under `/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/` is allowed. Your CSP should allow scripts served from your origin domain (`script-src self`).
* If your CSP uses a `nonce` for script tags, Cloudflare will add these nonces to the scripts it injects by parsing your CSP response header.
* If your CSP does not use `nonce` for script tags and **JavaScript Detection** is enabled, you may see a console error such as `Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-b123b8a70+4jEj+d6gWI9U6IilUJIrlnRJbRR/uQl2Jc='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.` We highly discourage the use of `unsafe-inline` and instead recommend the use CSP `nonces` in script tags which we parse and support in our CDN.
