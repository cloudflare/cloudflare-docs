The Bot Management Corporate Proxy field contains identified cloud-based corporate proxies and secure web gateways that are Enterprise-only, and provide outbound security services to their clients.

You can access the Corporate Proxy field in [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/), [rate limiting rules](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), or [Workers](/workers/) to provide different security rules for traffic from these sources. You can also exempt them from rules using Bot Management scores.
