The **Machine Learning (ML)** engine accounts for the majority of all detections, human and bot.

This approach leverages our global network, which proxies billions of requests daily, to identify both automated and human traffic. We constantly train the ML engine to become more accurate and adapt to new threats. Most importantly, this engine learns from traffic across all Cloudflare domains and uses these insights to score traffic while honoring our [strict privacy standards](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).
