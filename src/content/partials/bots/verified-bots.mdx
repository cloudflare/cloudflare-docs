Cloudflare maintains an internal list of <GlossaryTooltip term="verified bot">verified bots</GlossaryTooltip> that are associated with search engine optimization (SEO), website monitoring, and more.

You can use this list to prevent any bot protection measures from impacting otherwise helpful bots, such as search crawlers.
