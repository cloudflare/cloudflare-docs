You can block artificial intelligence (AI) bots, crawlers, and scrapers from scraping your website content and training large language models (LLM) to recreate it without your permission. When you enable this feature via a pre-configured managed rule, Cloudflare can detect and block verified AI bots that respect `robots.txt` and crawl rate, and do not hide their behavior from your website. The rule has also been expanded to include more signatures of AI bots that do not follow the rules.

This feature is available on all Cloudflare plans.
