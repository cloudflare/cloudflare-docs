In parts of your site where you want bot traffic, you can use the [*Skip* action](/waf/custom-rules/skip/) in [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) to specify where Super Bot Fight Mode should not run.

You can use the [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/) and its [operators](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/) and [fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/) in custom rules to configure a scoped rule for approved automated traffic in Super Bot Fight Mode.
