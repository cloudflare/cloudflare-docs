Cloudflare uses the `__cf_bm cookie` to smooth out the <GlossaryTooltip term="bot score">bot score</GlossaryTooltip> and reduce false positives for actual user sessions.

The Bot Management cookie measures a single user's request pattern and applies it to the machine learning data to generate a reliable bot score for all of that user's requests.

For more details, refer to [Cloudflare Cookies](/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cloudflare-cookies/).
