Bot Fight Mode is a simple, free product that helps detect and mitigate bot traffic on your domain. When enabled, the product:

* Identifies traffic matching patterns of known bots
* Issues computationally expensive challenges in response to these bots
* Notifies [Bandwidth Alliance](https://cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/) partners (if applicable) to disable bots
