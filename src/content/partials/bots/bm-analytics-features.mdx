For a full tour of Bot Analytics, see [our blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-bot-analytics/). At a high level, the tool includes:

* **Requests by bot score**: View your total domain traffic and segment it vertically by traffic type. Keep an eye on *automated* and *likely automated* traffic.
* **Bot score distribution**: View the number of requests assigned a bot score 1 through 99.
* **Bot score source**: Identify the most common detection engines used to score your traffic. Hover over a tooltip to learn more about each engine.
* **Top requests by attribute**: View more detailed information on specific IP addresses and other characteristics.

Bot Analytics shows up to one week of data at a time and can display data up to 30 days old. Bot Analytics displays data in real time in most cases.
