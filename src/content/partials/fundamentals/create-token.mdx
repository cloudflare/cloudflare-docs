:::note[Prerequisite]


Before you begin, [find your zone and account IDs](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/).


:::

1. Determine if you want a user token or an account owned token. If you are developing a new service that you want multiple superadministrators to use and the endpoints that you are calling are compatible with account owned tokens, the option exists to use account tokens that are not connected to a specific user.

2. From the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens/), go to **My Profile** > **API Tokens** for user tokens. For Account Tokens, go to **Manage Account** > **API Tokens**.

3. Select **Create Token**.

4. Select a template from the available [API token templates](/fundamentals/api/reference/template/) or create a custom token. The following example uses the **Edit zone DNS** template.

5. Add or edit the token name to describe why or how the token is used. Templates are prefilled with a token name and permissions.

6. Modify the token's permissions. After selecting a permissions group (*Account*, *User*, or *Zone*), choose what level of access to grant the token. Most groups offer `Edit` or `Read` options. `Edit` is full CRUDL (create, read, update, delete, list) access, while `Read` is the read permission and list where appropriate. Refer to the [available token permissions](/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) for more information.

7. Select which resources the token is authorized to access. For example, granting `Zone DNS Read` access to a zone `example.com` will allow the token to read DNS records only for that specific zone. Any other zone will return an error for DNS record reads operations. Any other operation on that zone will also return an error.

8. (Optional) Restrict how a token is used in the **Client IP Address Filtering** and **TTL (time to live)** fields.

9. Select **Continue to summary**.

10. Review the token summary. Select **Edit token** to make adjustments. You can also edit a token after creation.

11. Select **Create Token** to generate the token's secret.

12. Copy the secret to a secure place.

The token secret page also includes an example command to test the token. Use the `/user/tokens/verify` endpoint to fetch the current status of the given token.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/user/tokens/verify" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

The result:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "100bf38cc8393103870917dd535e0628",
    "status": "active"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [
    {
      "code": 10000,
      "message": "This API Token is valid and active",
      "type": null
    }
  ]
}
```

With this you have successfully created an API token and can start working with the Cloudflare API. After creating your first API token, you can create additional API tokens [via the API](/fundamentals/api/how-to/create-via-api/).
