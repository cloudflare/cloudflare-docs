Beyond hiding your origin's IP address from potential attackers, Cloudflare also stops malicious traffic before it reaches your origin web server.

Cloudflare automatically mitigates security risks using our [WAF](/waf/) and [DDoS protection](/ddos-protection/).

For additional details on security, refer to our guide on how to [Secure your website](/learning-paths/application-security/).
