Since this is a service with [usage-based billing](/support/account-management-billing/billing-add-on-service/), Cloudflare recommends that you set up usage-based billing notifications to avoid unexpected bills.

To set up those notifications:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

2. Select your account.

3. Go to **Notifications**.

4. On **Alert Type** of **Usage Based Billing**, click **Select**.

5. Fill out the following information:

   * **Name**
   * **Product**
   * **Notification limit** (exact metric will vary based on product)
   * **Notification email**

   :::note
   Some plans also have access to alerts through [PagerDuty](/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/) and [Webhooks](/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/). 
   :::

6. Select **Save**.
