Account Owned Tokens are the first step that Cloudflare is taking to represent service principals in our service, and it is currently being released in open beta.

Cloudflare is working to ensure that all features eventually become compatible with Account Owned Tokens. 

If you are working with a service that is not currently supported by Account Owned Tokens, it is recommended that you continue to use the existing user tokens.

:::note
User tokens will continue to work and we do not have plans to deprecate them.
:::

Account Owned Tokens will be visible for Super Administrators of accounts on the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) via **Manage Account** > **API Tokens**.

You can still create tokens using the Cloudflare dashboard, and it can also be accessed via the API at `/accounts/<accountID>/tokens`.

Try using Account Owned Tokens specifically in these scenarios:

- You require business continuity when managing tokens as a team of super administrators.
- You need to restrict API access on your account and want to centralize visibility and management of these tokens.
