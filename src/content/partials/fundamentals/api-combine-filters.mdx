Combine filters using `OR` and `AND` boolean logic:

* `AND` takes precedence over `OR` in all expressions.
* The `OR` operator is defined using a comma `,` or the `OR` keyword surrounded by whitespace.
* The `AND` operator is defined using a semicolon `;` or the `AND` keyword surrounded by whitespace.

  :::note


  Note that the semicolon is a reserved character in URLs ([RFC 1738](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738)) and should be percent-encoded as `%3B`.
