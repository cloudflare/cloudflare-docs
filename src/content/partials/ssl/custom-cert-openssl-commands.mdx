1. Run the following command to generate a 4096-bit RSA private key, using AES-256 encryption. Enter a passphrase when prompted.

```bash
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out rootca.key 4096
```

2. Create the CA root certificate. When prompted, fill in the information to be included in the certificate. For the `Common Name` field, use the domain name as value, not the hostname.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootca.key -sha256 -days 1826 -out rootca.crt
```

3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). When prompted, fill in the information to be included in the request. For the `Common Name` field, use the hostname as value.

```bash
openssl req -new -nodes -out cert.csr -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout cert.key
```

4. Sign the certificate using the `rootca.key` and `rootca.crt` created in previous steps.

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in cert.csr -CA rootca.crt -CAkey rootca.key -CAcreateserial -out cert.crt -days 730 -sha256 -extfile ./cert.v3.ext
```

5. Make sure the certificate extensions file `cert.v3.ext` specifies the following:

```
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
```
