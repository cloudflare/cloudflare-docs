For Universal certificates, Cloudflare controls the validity periods and certificate autorities (CAs), making sure that renewal always occur.

Universal certificates issued by Let's Encrypt, Google Trust Services, or SSL.com have a 90-day validity period. Cloudflare no longer uses DigiCert for newly issued Universal certificates and, for existing ones, the validity period is being adjusted from one year to 90 days.
