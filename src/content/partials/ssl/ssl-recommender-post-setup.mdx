Once enabled, the SSL/TLS Recommender runs an origin scan using the user agent `Cloudflare-SSLDetector` and ignores your `robots.txt` file (except for rules explicitly targeting the user agent).

Based on this initial scan, the Recommender may decide that you could use a stronger [SSL encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/). It will never recommend a weaker option than what is currently configured.

If so, it will send the application owner an email with the recommended option and add a *Recommended by Cloudflare* tag to that option on the **SSL/TLS** page. You are not required to use this recommendation.

If you do not receive an email, keep your current **SSL encryption mode**.
