Before deploying custom certificates to Cloudflare's global network, Cloudflare automatically groups the certificates into certificate packs.

A certificate pack is a group of certificates that share the same set of hostnames — for example, `example.com` and `*.example.com` — but use different signature algorithms.

Each pack can include up to three certificates, one from each of the following signature algorithms:

* `SHA-2/RSA`
* `SHA-2/ECDSA`
* `SHA-1/RSA`
