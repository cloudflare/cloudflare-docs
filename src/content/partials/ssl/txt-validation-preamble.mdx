Once you [create a new certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/manage-certificates/#create-a-certificate) and choose the validation method of **TXT**, your tokens will be ready after a few seconds.

These tokens can be fetched through the API or the dashboard when the certificates are in a [pending validation](/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/#new-certificates) state during custom hostname creation or during certificate renewals.
