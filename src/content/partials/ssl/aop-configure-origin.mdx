With the certificate installed, set up your origin web server to accept client certificates.

Check the examples below for Apache and NGINX or refer to your origin web server documentation - e.g. [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/latest/security/authentication/client-certificate-authentication/), [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/tls/#client-authentication-mtls), [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/tls_connection_policies/client_authentication/mode/).


<Details header="Apache example">

```txt
SSLVerifyDepth 1
SSLCACertificateFile /path/to/origin-pull-ca.pem
```

For this example, you would have saved your certificate to `/path/to/origin-pull-ca.pem`.

{props.one}


</Details>


<Details header="NGINX example">

```txt
ssl_verify_client optional;
ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cloudflare.crt;
```

For this example, you would have saved your certificate to `/etc/nginx/certs/cloudflare.crt`.

{props.two}

At this point, you may also want to enable logging on your origin so that you can verify the configuration is working.
