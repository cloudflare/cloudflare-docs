To make sure you do not inadvertently block the **SSL/TLS Recommender**, review your settings to make sure your domain:

* Is accessible.
* Is not blocking requests from our bot (which uses a user agent of `Cloudflare-SSLDetector`).
* Does not have any active, SSL-specific [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/) or [Configuration rules](/rules/configuration-rules/).
