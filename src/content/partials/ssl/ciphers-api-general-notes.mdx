Make the following API call with the appropriate `{zone_id}`, `<EMAIL>`, and `<API_KEY>`.

If you [choose to use a token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/), you will not need an email nor an API key. You will instead replace the `X-Auth-Email` and `X-Auth-Key` headers by `--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \`.
