[Network Time Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1305) (NTP) is an Internet protocol designed to synchronize time between computer systems communicating over unreliable and variable-latency network paths. Cloudflare offers its version of NTP for free so you can use our [global anycast network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) to synchronize time from our closest server.
