The MSS value depends on how your network is set up.

- **Magic Transit ingress-only traffic (DSR):**

  - **On your edge router transit ports**: Apply a TCP MSS clamp with a maximum of 1,436 bytes.
  - **On any IPsec/GRE tunnels with third parties on your Magic Transit prefix**: Apply the MSS clamp on the internal tunnel interface (most likely on a separate firewall behind the GRE-terminating router) to reduce the current value by 24 bytes.

- **For Magic Transit ingress + egress traffic:**

  - **On the Magic Transit GRE tunnel internal interface**: Meaning where the Magit Transit egress traffic will traverse. This may be done automatically once the tunnel is configured but it depends on your devices. The TCP MSS clamp should be 1,436 bytes maximum.
  - **On any IPsec/GRE tunnels with third parties on your Magic Transit prefix**: On the internal tunnel interface (most likely on a separate firewall behind the GRE-terminating router) to reduce its current value by 24 bytes.
