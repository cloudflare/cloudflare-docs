Cloudflare {props.one} uses tunnels to deliver packets from our global network to your data centers. Cloudflare encapsulates these packets adding new headers. You need to account for the space these headers occupy when setting Maximum Transmission Unit (or MTU) and Maximum Segment Size (or MSS) values for your network.

#### MSS clamping recommendations

##### GRE tunnels as off-ramp

##### IPsec tunnels

<Render file="mtu-mss/mss-clamping-ipsec" product="magic-transit" />

:::caution[Important]
Refer to your device documentation to check if it sets IPsec MSS clamping automatically. If that is not the case and you are using IPsec inside GRE, you have to set MSS clamp manually.
