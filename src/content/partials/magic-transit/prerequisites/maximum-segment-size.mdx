Cloudflare {props.one} uses tunnels to deliver packets from our global network to your data centers. Cloudflare encapsulates these packets adding new headers. You must account for the space consumed by these headers when configuring the maximum transmission unit (MTU) and maximum segment size (MSS) values for your network.

#### MSS clamping recommendations

##### GRE tunnels as off-ramp

##### IPsec tunnels

:::caution[Important]
Refer to your device documentation to check if it sets IPsec MSS clamping automatically. If that is not the case and you are using IPsec inside GRE, you have to set MSS clamp manually.
