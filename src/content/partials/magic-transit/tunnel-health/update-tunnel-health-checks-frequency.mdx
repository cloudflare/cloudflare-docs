By default, Cloudflare servers send <GlossaryTooltip term="tunnel health-check" link={props.one}>health checks</GlossaryTooltip> to each <GlossaryTooltip term="GRE tunnel">GRE</GlossaryTooltip>, CNI, or <GlossaryTooltip term="IPsec tunnel">IPsec</GlossaryTooltip> tunnel endpoint you configure to receive traffic from Magic Transit and Magic WAN. You can configure this frequency via the dashboard or [the API](/api/operations/magic-gre-tunnels-update-gre-tunnel) to suit your use case. For example, if you are connecting a lower-traffic site for which you do not need immediate failover and would rather receive a lower volume of health check traffic, you should set the frequency to `low`. On the other hand, if you are connecting a site that is extremely sensitive to any issues, and you want a more proactive failover at the earliest sign of a potential problem, you should set this to `high`.

Available options are `low`, `mid`, and `high`.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="dashboard">

1. Refer to <a href={props.two}>Add tunnels</a> to learn how to create or edit your tunnel.
2. Change the **Health check rate** to your desired rate. For example, *Low*.
3. Save your changes.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

You can adjust the health check frequency by updating your [GRE](/api/operations/magic-gre-tunnels-update-gre-tunnel), [IPsec](/api/operations/magic-ipsec-tunnels-update-ipsec-tunnel), or [CNI](/api/operations/magic-interconnects-update-interconnect) tunnels.

Below is an example of how to adjust tunnel health check frequency to `low`. Note that this command applies to GRE, IPsec and CNI tunnels:

```bash
curl --request PUT \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/gre_tunnels/{tunnel_id} \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "health_check": {"rate":"low"}
}'
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>
