When you create a gateway, Cloudflare automatically:

* Creates and adds [records to your Cloudflare DNS](/web3/reference/gateway-dns-records/) so your gateway can receive and route traffic appropriately.
* [Proxies](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) traffic to that hostname.
* Issues an SSL/TLS certificate to cover the specified hostname.
