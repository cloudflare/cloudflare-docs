## SQL in Durable Objects vs D1

Cloudflare Workers offers a SQLite-backed serverless database product - [D1](/d1/). How should you compare [SQLite in Durable Objects](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sql-storage) and D1?

**D1 is a managed database product.** 

D1 fits into a familiar architecture for developers, where application servers communicate with a database over the network. Application servers are typically Workers; however, D1 also supports external, non-Worker access via an [HTTP API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/cloudflare-d1-query-database), which helps unlock [third-party tooling](/d1/reference/community-projects/#_top) support for D1. 

D1 aims for a "batteries included" feature set, including the above HTTP API, [database schema management](/d1/reference/migrations/#_top), [data import/export](/d1/build-with-d1/import-export-data/), and [database query insights](/d1/observability/metrics-analytics/#query-insights). 

With D1, your application code and SQL database queries are not colocated which can impact application performance. If performance is a concern with D1, Workers has [Smart Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/#_top) to dynamically run your Worker in the best location to reduce total Worker request latency, considering everything your Worker talks to, including D1.

**SQLite in Durable Objects is a lower-level compute with storage building block for distributed systems.**

By design, Durable Objects are accessed with Workers-only.

Durable Objects require a bit more effort, but in return, give you more flexibility and control. With Durable Objects, you must implement two pieces of code that run in different places: a front-end Worker which routes incoming requests from the Internet to a unique Durable Object, and the Durable Object itself, which runs on the same machine as the SQLite database. You get to choose what runs where, and it may be that your application benefits from running some application business logic right next to the database.
 
With SQLite in Durable Objects, you may also need to build some of your own database tooling that comes out-of-the-box with D1.

SQL query pricing and limits are intended to be identical between D1 ([pricing](/d1/platform/pricing/), [limits](/d1/platform/limits/)) and SQLite in Durable Objects ([pricing](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#sql-storage-billing), [limits](/durable-objects/platform/limits/)). During SQLite in Durable Objects beta, Storage per Durable Object is 1GB, which will be raised to mirror storage per D1 database (10GB) by general availability.
