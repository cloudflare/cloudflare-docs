Though you can change your [queueing method](/waiting-room/reference/queueing-methods/), it may affect users if your waiting room is actively queueing:

* **From FIFO to Random**: Users will no longer be ordered based on their cookie timestamp, which may affect the displayed wait time.
* **From Random to FIFO**: Users will be ordered based on their cookie timestamp, meaning any new users move to the end of the FIFO queue.

:::note


If you change the queueing method from FIFO > Random > FIFO, users will be ordered by their original entry time.
