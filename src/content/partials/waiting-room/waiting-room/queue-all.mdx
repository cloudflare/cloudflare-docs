To queue all visitors prior to a time-based offering, set up a pre-queue as part of a [waiting room event](/waiting-room/additional-options/create-events/#create-an-event-from-the-dashboard).

To start queueing all new visitors without a scheduled event:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Waiting Room**.
2. On a waiting room:
   1. Ensure **Enabled** is set to **On**.
   2. Set **Queue-all** to **On**.
3. Your waiting room will begin queueing all new visitors and will not allow any new visitors to the path protected by your waiting room. Queue-all will override all other waiting room settings, including event settings.

:::note[Note]

Only new visitors will be queued. Active users that are already on your website will continue there and will not return to the queue until their session expires.

4. To begin allowing visitors to the path protected by your waiting room, set **Queue-all** to **Off**.
