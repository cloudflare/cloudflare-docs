Cloudflare partners with {props.one} to provide {props.one} customers’ websites with Cloudflare’s performance and security benefits.

If you use {props.one} and also have a Cloudflare plan, you can use your own Cloudflare zone to proxy web traffic to your zone first, then {props.one}'s (the SaaS Provider) zone second. This configuration option is called [Orange-to-Orange (O2O)](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).
