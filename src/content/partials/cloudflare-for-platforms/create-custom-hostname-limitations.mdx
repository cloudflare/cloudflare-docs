:::note[Default behavior]


When you create a custom hostname:

* If you issue a custom hostname certificate with wildcards enabled, you cannot customize TLS settings for these wildcard hostnames.
* If you do not specify the **Minimum TLS Version**, it defaults to 1.0, not the zone's Minimum TLS Version. You can still edit this setting after creation.
