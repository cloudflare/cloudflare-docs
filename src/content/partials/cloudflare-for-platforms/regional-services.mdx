If you have [regional services](/data-localization/regional-services/) set up for your custom hostnames, Cloudflare always uses the processing region associated with your DNS target record (instead of the processing region of any [custom origins](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/custom-origin/)).
