For each custom hostname, Cloudflare issues two certificates bundled in chains that maximize browser compatibility (unless you [upload custom certificates](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/custom-certificates/uploading-certificates/)).

The primary certificate uses a `P-256` key, is `SHA-2/ECDSA` signed, and will be presented to browsers that support elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The secondary or fallback certificate uses an `RSA 2048-bit` key, is `SHA-2/RSA` signed, and will be presented to browsers that do not support ECC.
