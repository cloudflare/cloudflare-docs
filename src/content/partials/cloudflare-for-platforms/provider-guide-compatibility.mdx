When a hostname within your Cloudflare zone has O2O enabled, you assume additional responsibility for the traffic on that hostname because you can now configure various Cloudflare products to affect that traffic. Some of the Cloudflare products compatible with O2O are:

* [Caching](/cache/)
* [Workers](/workers/)
* [Rules](/rules/)

For a full list of compatible products and potential limitations, refer to [Product compatibility](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/product-compatibility/).
