You need to perform the following steps for each custom hostname.

### Step 1 — Plan for validation

Before you create a hostname, you need to plan for:

1. [Certificate validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/): Upon successful validation, the certificates are deployed to Cloudflare’s global network.
2. [Hostname validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/): Upon successful validation, Cloudflare proxies traffic for this hostname.

You must complete both these steps for the hostname to work as expected.

Depending on which method you select for each of these options, additional steps might be required for you and your customers.

### Step 2 — Create custom hostname

After planning for certification and hostname validation, you can create the custom hostname.

To create a custom hostname:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="dashboard">

<Render file="create-custom-hostname" product="cloudflare-for-platforms" />

<Render file="create-custom-hostname-limitations" product="cloudflare-for-platforms" />

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

<Render file="create-custom-hostname-api" product="cloudflare-for-platforms" />

<Render file="create-custom-hostname-limitations" product="cloudflare-for-platforms" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>
