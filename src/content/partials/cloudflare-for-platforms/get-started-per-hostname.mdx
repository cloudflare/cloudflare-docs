You need to perform the following steps for each custom hostname.

### Step 1 — Plan for validation

Before you create a hostname, you need to plan for:

1. [Certificate validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/): Upon successful validation, the certificates are deployed to Cloudflare’s global network.
2. [Hostname validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/): Upon successful validation, Cloudflare proxies traffic for this hostname.

You must complete both these steps for the hostname to work as expected.

:::caution

Depending on which method you select for each of these options, additional steps might be required for you and your customers.

### Step 2 — Create custom hostname

After planning for certification and hostname validation, you can create the custom hostname.

To create a custom hostname:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="create-custom-hostname" product="cloudflare-for-platforms" />

<Render
	file="create-custom-hostname-limitations"
	product="cloudflare-for-platforms"
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="create-custom-hostname-api" product="cloudflare-for-platforms" />

<Render
	file="create-custom-hostname-limitations"
	product="cloudflare-for-platforms"
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>
