Workers AI supports OpenAI compatible endpoints for [text generation](/workers-ai/models/#text-generation) (`/v1/chat/completions`) and [text embedding models](/workers-ai/models/#text-embeddings) (`/v1/embeddings`). This allows you to use the same code as you would for your OpenAI commands, but swap in Workers AI easily.
