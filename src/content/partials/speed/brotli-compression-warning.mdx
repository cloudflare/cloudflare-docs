## Notes about end-to-end compression

Even when using the same compression algorithm end to end (between your origin server and Cloudflare, and between the Cloudflare global network and your website visitor), Cloudflare will need to decompress the response and compress it again if you enable any of the following settings for the request:

- [Automatic HTTPS Rewrites](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/automatic-https-rewrites/)
- [Cloudflare Fonts](/speed/optimization/content/fonts/)
- [Email Address Obfuscation](/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/)
- [Mirage](/speed/optimization/images/mirage/)
- [Polish](/images/polish/)
- [Rocket Loader](/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/)
- [JavaScript detections](/bots/reference/javascript-detections)
- [RUM](/speed/speed-test/run-speed-test/#enable-real-user-monitoring-rum)

To disable these settings for specific URI paths, create a [configuration rule](/rules/configuration-rules/).

:::note
Additionally, the [Replace insecure JS libraries](/waf/tools/replace-insecure-js-libraries/) setting also requires Cloudflare to decompress the response and compress it again. At this time, you cannot turn it off using Configuration Rules.
