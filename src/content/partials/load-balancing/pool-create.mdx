You can create a pool within the [load balancer workflow](/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/) or in the **Pools** section of the dashboard:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.

2. Select **Manage Pools** and then **Create**.

3. For your pool, enter the following information:
   * A name (must be unique)
   * A description to provide more detail on the name
   * A choice for [**Endpoint Steering**](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/), which affects how your pool routes traffic to each endpoint

4. For each endpoint, enter the following information:
   * A name (must be unique)
   * The endpoint address or associated hostname
   * (Optional) A [**Virtual Network**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/). Required when the endpoint has a private IP address.
   * A [**Weight**](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/#weights)
   * (Optional) A [hostname](/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/) by clicking **Add host header**

:::note[Note]


If your endpoint is a website or application hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/), you will need to fill in the host header field with the project domain for it to resolve correctly.

5. Repeat this process for additional endpoints in the pool.

6. (Optional) Set up coordinates for [Proximity Steering](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/proximity-steering/) on the pool.

7. On the pool, update the following information:
   * **Health Threshold**: <Render file="pool-health-threshold" product="load-balancing" />
   * **Monitor**: Attach a [monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/)
   * **Health Monitor Regions**: Choose whether to check pool health from [multiple locations](/load-balancing/monitors/#health-monitor-regions), which increases accuracy but can lead to probe traffic to your endpoint
   * **Pool Notifications**: You can set up new alerts - and view existing alerts - to be notified when pools are enabled or disabled, or pools or endpoints have changes in their [health status](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/).

8. When finished, select **Save**.
