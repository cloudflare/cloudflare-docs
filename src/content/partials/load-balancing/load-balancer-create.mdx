To create a load balancer in the dashboard:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.

2. Select **Create Load Balancer**.

3. On the **Hostname** page:
   * Enter a **Hostname**, which is the DNS name at which the load balancer is available. For more details on record priority, refer to [DNS records for load balancing](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/).
   * Toggle the orange cloud icon to update the [proxy mode](/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/), which affects how traffic is routed and which IP addresses are advertised.
   * If you want [session-based load balancing](/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/), toggle the **Session Affinity** switch.

4. Select **Next**.

5. On the **Add a Pool** page:
   * Select one or more existing pools or [create a new pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool).
   * If you are going to set [traffic steering](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/standard-options/) to **Off**, re-order the pools in your load balancer to adjust the fallback order.
   * If needed, update the [**Fallback Pool**](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/#fallback-pools).
   * If you choose to set traffic steering to **Random**, you can set [Weights](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/standard-options/#random-steering) (via the API) to your pools to determine the percentage of traffic sent to each pool.

6. Select **Next**.

7. On the **Monitors** page:
   * Review the monitors attached to your pools.
   * If needed, you can attach an existing monitor or [create a new monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/#create-a-monitor).

8. Select **Next**.

9. On the **Traffic Steering** page, choose an option for [Traffic steering](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) and select **Next**.

10. On the **Custom Rules** page, select an existing rule or [create a new rule](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/).

11. Select **Next**.

12. On the **Review** page:
    * Review your configuration and make any changes.
    * Choose whether to **Save as Draft** or **Save and Deploy**.
