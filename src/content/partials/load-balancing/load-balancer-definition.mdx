A load balancer distributes traffic among pools according to [pool health](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/) and [traffic steering policies](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/). Each load balancer is identified by its DNS hostname (`lb.example.com`, `dev.example.com`, etc.).
