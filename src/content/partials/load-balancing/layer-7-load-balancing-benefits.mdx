In comparison to DNS-only load balancing, layer 7 load balancing:

* Protects endpoints from DDoS attacks by hiding their IP addresses.
* Offers faster failover and more accurate routing, which can otherwise be affected by DNS caching.
* Integrates with other Cloudflare features such as caching, Workers, and the WAF.
* Reduces authoritative queries against Cloudflare, which can potentially save money for customers with usage-based billing.
* Supports customized [session affinity](/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/) and [endpoint drain](/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/#endpoint-drain).
* More accurately geo-locates traffic, using the data center associated with the user making the request instead of the data center associated with a user's recursive resolver.
