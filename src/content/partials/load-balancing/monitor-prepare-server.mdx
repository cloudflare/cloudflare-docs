Make sure that your firewall or web server does not block or rate limit your configured health monitors or requests associated with [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

Each health monitor has the HTTP user-agent of `"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Cloudflare-Traffic-Manager/1.0; +https://www.cloudflare.com/traffic-manager/; pool-id: $poolid)"`, where the `$poolid` is the first 16 characters of the [associated pool](/load-balancing/pools/).

:::caution


If you know that your endpoint is healthy but Load Balancing is reporting it as unhealthy, refer to our [Monitor troubleshooting guide](/load-balancing/troubleshooting/load-balancing-faq/#why-is-my-endpoint-or-pool-considered-unhealthy).
