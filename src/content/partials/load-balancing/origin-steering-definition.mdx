Endpoint steering customizes how each [pool](/load-balancing/pools/) distributes requests to its associated endpoints.

These distributions are a combination of two properties:

* The endpoint steering [policy](#policies) chosen for your pool.
* The [weights](#weights) assigned to each endpoint.

:::note


If an endpoint [becomes unhealthy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/), your pool will also re-balance traffic according to its endpoint steering policy.
