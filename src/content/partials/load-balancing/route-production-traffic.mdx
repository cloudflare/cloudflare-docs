Now that you have set up your load balancer and verified everything is working correctly, you can put the load balancer on a live domain or subdomain:

1. If you update your pools and monitors, review the pool health again to make sure everything is working as expected.
2. Confirm that your production hostname has the correct [priority order](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/#priority-order) of DNS records and is covered by an [SSL/TLS certificate](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/#ssltls-coverage).
3. Configure your load balancer to receive production traffic, which could involve either:
   * Editing the **Hostname** of your existing load balancer.
   * Updating the `CNAME` record sending traffic to your load balancer.

:::note


If you have an Enterprise account, also evaluate your application for any excluded paths. For example, you might not want the load balancer to distribute requests directed at your `/admin` path. For any exceptions, set up an [origin rule](/rules/origin-rules/features/#dns-record) or [page rule](/rules/page-rules/how-to/override-url-or-ip-address/).
