Before directing any traffic to your pools, make sure that your pools and monitors are set up correctly. The status of your health check will be *unknown* until the results of the first check are available.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To confirm pool health using the dashboard:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.
2. Select **Manage Pools**.
3. For pools and individual endpoints, review the values in the **Health** and **Endpoint Health** columns.

For more information on pool and endpoint health statuses, refer to [How a pool becomes unhealthy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/#how-a-pool-becomes-unhealthy).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To fetch the latest health status of all pools, use the [List Pools](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-pools-list-pools) command, paying attention to the `healthy` value for pools and origins (endpoints).

For troubleshooting a specific pool's health, use the [Pool Health Details](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-pools-pool-health-details) command.

</TabItem> </Tabs>
