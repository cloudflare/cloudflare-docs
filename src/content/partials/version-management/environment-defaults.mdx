* **Development**: Meant to validate that changes work correctly. The default [traffic filters](/version-management/reference/traffic-filters/) are that the `cf.zone.name` matches your zone name, the `Edge Server IP` is a specific value, and the request contains a cookie with `development=true`.
* **Staging**: Meant to test changes before sending them to **Production**. The default [traffic filters](/version-management/reference/traffic-filters/) are that the `cf.zone.name` matches your zone name and the `Edge Server IP` is a specific value.
* **Production**: Meant to hold all configurations applied to your zone. You cannot edit the [traffic filters](/version-management/reference/traffic-filters/) - which are just that the `cf.zone.name` is equal to your zone's name - and cannot delete this environment. This environment has a read-only check enabled, so versions promoted to this environment will become read-only as well.
