If you have a Cloudflare contact (Enterprise only), ask them to set up your account as a multi-user organization. Account members will need:

* [**Access** permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/) to read or edit applications and Access policies.
* [**Gateway** permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/) to read or edit Gateway policies.
* [**PII** permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#cloudflare-zero-trust-pii) to view user information in Gateway activity logs.
