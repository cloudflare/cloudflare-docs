Most admins test by manually downloading the WARP client and enrolling in your organization's Cloudflare Zero Trust instance.

## Install WARP

1. First, uninstall any existing third-party VPN software if possible. Sometimes products placed in a disconnected or disabled state will still interfere with the WARP client.
2. If you are running third-party firewall or TLS decryption software, verify that it does not inspect or block traffic to these IP addresses:
   * Client orchestration IPs: <Render file="warp/client-orchestration-ips" product="cloudflare-one" />
   * Gateway DoH IPs: <Render file="warp/doh-ips" product="cloudflare-one" />
     For more information, refer to [WARP with firewall](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/firewall/).
3. Manually install WARP on the device.
