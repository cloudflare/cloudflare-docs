<Details header="Authenticated Origin Pulls">

[Authenticated Origin Pulls](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/) helps ensure requests to your origin server come from the Cloudflare network.

* **Security**: Very secure.
* **Availability**: All customers.
* **Challenges**:
  * Requires [Full](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [Full (strict)](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) encryption modes.
  * Requires more configuration efforts for application and server, such as uploading a certificate and configuring the server to use it.
  * For more strict security, you should upload your own certificate. Although Cloudflare provides you a certificate for easy configuration, this certificate only guarantees that a request is coming from the Cloudflare network.
  * Not scalable for large numbers of origin servers.
