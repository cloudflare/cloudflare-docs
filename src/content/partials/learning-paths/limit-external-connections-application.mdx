<Details header="HTTP Header Validation">

Only allow traffic with specific (and secret) HTTP headers.

* **Security**: Moderately secure.
* **Availability**: All customers.
* **Challenges**:
  * Requires more configuration efforts on application- and server-side to accept those headers.
  * Basic authentication is vulnerable to replay attacks. Because basic authentication does not encrypt user credentials, it is important that traffic always be sent over an encrypted SSL session.
  * There might be valid use cases for a mismatch in SNI / Host headers such as through [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/how-to/rewrite-host-headers/), [Load Balancing](/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/), or [Workers](/workers/runtime-apis/request/), which all offer HTTP Host Header overrides.
* **Process**:
  1. Use [Transform rules](/rules/transform/request-header-modification/) or [Workers](/workers/examples/alter-headers/) to add an HTTP Auth Header.
  2. Configure your origin server to restrict access based on the [HTTP Auth Header](/workers/examples/auth-with-headers/) (or perform [HTTP Basic Authentication](/workers/examples/basic-auth/)).
  3. Configure your origin server to restrict access based on the [HTTP Host Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host). Specifically, only allow requests which contain expected HTTP Host Header values, and reject all other requests.

<Details header="JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Validation">

Only allow traffic with the appropriate JWT.

* **Security**: Very secure.
* **Availability**: Some customers.
* **Challenges**:
  * Requires either installing incremental software or modifying application code.
  * Lots of manual work.
* **Resources**:
  * [Validate JWTs for an Access application](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/validating-json/)
  * [Validate JWTs for an API](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/)
