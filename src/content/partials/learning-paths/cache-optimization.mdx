A few ways to optimize Cloudflare caching include:

* Creating [cache rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) to customize the cache properties of specific HTTP requests.
* Enabling the [Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) feature, which dramatically increases cache hit ratios.
* Reviewing our other various [configuration options](/cache/get-started/), which may vary based on your plan and application setup.
