<Details header="Notes about the rule equivalence">

The provided example using Single Redirects is not an exact match for the previously existing Page Rule in the same example.

The exact equivalent would need to match both HTTP and HTTPS incoming requests, which you could achieve using a wildcard pattern like the following (notice the extra `*` after `http`):

- **Request URL**: <code>{props.requestUrl}</code>

This would require you to also change the **Target URL** to use the second wildcard capture group instead of the first one (corresponding to the text captured by second `*` in the wildcard pattern above):

- **Target URL**: <code>{props.targetUrl}</code>
