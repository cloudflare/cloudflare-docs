  description: "Whisper is a pre-trained model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation. Trained on 680k hours of labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalize to many datasets and domains without the need for fine-tuning. This is the English-only version of the Whisper Tiny model which was trained on the task of speech recognition."
