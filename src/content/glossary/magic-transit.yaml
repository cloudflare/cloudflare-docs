  - term: prefix
    general_definition: |-
      a number that identifies the network portion of an IP address. It tells devices if an IP address is on the same network or not. It is shown as a number after a slash (for example, `/31`) at the end of the IP address. 

      Using an analogy, the prefix is like a street address. If an IP is in the same street, it belongs to the same network of devices.
