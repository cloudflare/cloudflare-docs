  - term: certificate
    general_definition: |-
      SSL certificates enable encryption over HTTPS for traffic between a client and a website. SSL certificates contain the website's public key and the website's identity along with related information. Devices attempting to communicate with the origin web server reference the SSL certificate to obtain the public key and verify the server's identity. Cloudflare provides a [Universal SSL certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) for each active Cloudflare domain.

  - term: certificate packs
    general_definition: |-
      certificate packs allow Cloudflare to fallback to a different SSL certificate for browsers that do not support the latest standards. Certificate packs allow Custom SSL certificates to contain different signature algorithms for the same hostnames listed within the SSL certificate without taking up additional Custom SSL certificate quota for your Cloudflare account.

  - term: certificate pinning
    general_definition: |-
      a security mechanism used to prevent on-path attacks on the Internet by hardcoding information about the certificate that the application expects to receive. If the wrong certificate is received, even if it is trusted by the system, the application will refuse to connect.

  - term: cipher suite
    general_definition: |-
      a set of encryption algorithms for establishing a secure communications connection. There are several cipher suites in wide use, and a client and server agree on the cipher suite to use when establishing the TLS connection. Support of multiple cipher suites allows compatibility across various clients.

  - term: domain control validation (DCV)
    general_definition: |-
      process by which a certificate authority (CA) can verify domain ownership before issuing an SSL/TLS certificate.

  - term: encryption algorithm
    general_definition: |-
      an encryption algorithm is a set of mathematical operations performed on data to ensure the data is only understood by the intended recipient.

  - term: edge certificate
    general_definition: |-
      the SSL/TLS certificates that Cloudflare presents to clients visiting your website or application.

      Because of [how Cloudflare works](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/), there can actually be [two certificates involved in a single request](/ssl/concepts/): an edge certificate and an origin certificate.

  - term: Extended Validation (EV) certificate
    general_definition: |-
      EV certificates provide maximum trust to visitors, but require the most validation effort by the CA. EV certificates show the name of the company or organization in the address bar of the visitor’s browser. An EV certificate requires additional documentation by the company or organization in order for the CA to approve the certificate.

  - term: intermediate certificate
    general_definition: |-
      for security purposes, CAs issue intermediate certificates for signing website certificates. Intermediate certificates provide a means for the CA to revoke a single intermediate certificate, thus affecting only a small subset of website certificates.

  - term: mTLS (mutual TLS)
    general_definition: |-
      mTLS is a common security practice that uses TLS certificates to ensure that traffic between a client and server is secure and trusted in both directions.

  - term: origin certificate
    general_definition: |-
      a Cloudflare Origin Certificate is a free SSL/TLS certificate issued by Cloudflare that can be installed on your origin server to facilitate making sure your data is encrypted in transit from Cloudflare to your origin server using HTTPS.

  - term: Organization Validated (OV) certificate
    general_definition: |-
      OV certificates are used by corporations or governments to portray an extra layer of confidence for their visitors. Rather than just validating domain ownership, the CA also validates the company’s registration using qualified independent information sources. The organization’s name is listed in the certificate.

  - term: primary certificate / secondary certificate
    general_definition: |-
      Primary and secondary indicates the order in which Custom SSL certificates were uploaded to Cloudflare. The primary certificate is the first certificate added to a pack. The primary certificate defines the hostnames covered by the certificate.

  - term: public key / private key
    general_definition: |-
      SSL public and private keys are essentially long strings of characters used for encrypting and decrypting data. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. Private keys are kept secret and unshared.

  - term: root certificate
    general_definition: |-
      a root certificate is generated by a CA and is used to sign certificates. Every browser includes a root store of trusted root certificates. Any certificate signed with the private key of a root certificate is automatically trusted by a browser.

  - term: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
    general_definition: |-
      SSL was a widely used cryptographic protocol for providing data security for Internet communications. SSL was superseded by TLS; however, most people still refer to Internet cryptographic protocols as SSL.

  - term: Server Name Indication (SNI)
    general_definition: |-
      SNI allows a server to host multiple TLS Certificates for multiple websites using a single IP address. SNI adds the website hostname in the TLS handshake to inform the server which website to present when using shared IPs.

      Cloudflare uses SNI for all Universal SSL certificates.

  - term: Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
    general_definition: |-
      The SAN field of an SSL certificate specifies additional hostnames (sites, IP addresses, common names, subdomains, apex domains, etc.) protected by a single SSL Certificate.

  - term: TLS (Transport Layer Security)
    general_definition: |-
      TLS is a cryptographic protocol that ensures data security over a computer network, such as the Internet. It encrypts the data that is transmitted between a user's computer and a web server.

  - term: Universal SSL certificate
    general_definition: |-
      by default, Cloudflare issues — and renews — free, unshared, publicly trusted SSL certificates to all domains [added to](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) and [activated on](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) Cloudflare.

  - term: validation level
    general_definition: |-
      the level to which a certificate authority validates domain ownership before issuing an SSL/TLS certificate.

      The different certificate validation levels are DV (Domain Validated), OV (Organization Validated), or EV (Extended Validation).
