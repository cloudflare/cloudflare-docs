- term: apex domain
  general_definition: |-
    apex domain is used to refer to a domain that does not contain a subdomain part, such as `example.com` (without `www.`). It is also known as "root domain" or "naked domain".

- term: DNS over HTTPS
  general_definition: |-
    DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a standard for encrypting DNS traffic via the HTTPS protocol, preventing tracking and spoofing of DNS queries.

- term: DNS over TLS
  general_definition: |-
    DNS over TLS (DoT) is a standard for encrypting DNS traffic using its own port (`853`) and TLS encryption.

- term: DNS record
  general_definition: |-
    DNS records are instructions that live in authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain including what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain.

- term: DNS server
  general_definition: |-
    DNS servers translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, eliminating the need to remember complex IP addresses.

- term: DNS zone
  general_definition: |-
    a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator.

- term: Domain Name System (DNS)
  general_definition: |-
    the Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses.

- term: EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)
  general_definition: |-
    ECS is a DNS extension that enables recursive DNS resolvers to include client IP address information in their DNS queries.

    Not all resolvers use ECS but, if they do, usually a part of the IP address is omitted. Sending ECS headers is generally intended to reduce latency and speed up content delivery in connection to [CDNs](/glossary/?term=cdn) and [load balancers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-load-balancing/). The ECS mechanism is specified in [RFC 7871](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/inline-errata/rfc7871.html).

- term: hostname
  general_definition: |-
    the name given to a server or node on a network, often the public DNS name of a server.

- term: nameserver
  general_definition: |-
    a nameserver is a dedicated server that translates human readable hostnames (`www.example.com`) into IP addresses.

    Nameservers like root servers, TLD servers, and [authoritative nameservers](/dns/nameservers/) are fundamental components of the Domain Name System (DNS).

- term: partial setup
  general_definition: |-
    also known as CNAME setup, a partial setup allows you to use Cloudflare's reverse proxy without using Cloudflare for your authoritative nameservers.

- term: proxy status
  general_definition: |-
    the proxy status of a DNS record defines whether requests for your domain will route through Cloudflare (`proxied`) or not (`DNS-only`).

    When a [DNS record is proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/), requests are processed according to your configurations, and Cloudflare can optimize, cache, and protect your domain. Refer to [How Cloudflare works](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) for details.
