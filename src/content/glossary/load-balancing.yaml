productName: Load Balancing
entries:
  - term: endpoint
    general_definition: |-
      any service or hardware that intercepts and processes incoming public or private traffic.

      Examples of endpoints include origins, hostnames, private or public IP addresses, virtual IP addresses (VIPs), servers, and other dedicated hardware boxes.

  - term: pool
    general_definition: |-
      within Cloudflare, pools represent your endpoints and how they are organized. As such, a pool can be a group of several endpoints, or you could also have only one endpoint (an origin server, for example) per pool.

      If you are familiar with DNS terminology, think of a pool as a “record set,” except Cloudflare only returns addresses that are considered healthy. You can attach health monitors to individual pools for customized monitoring.

  - term: monitor
    general_definition: |-
      a monitor issues health monitor requests at regular intervals to evaluate the health of each endpoint within a [pool](/load-balancing/pools/).

      When a pool [becomes unhealthy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/), your load balancer takes that pool out of the endpoint rotation.

  - term: health check
    general_definition: |-
      requests issued by a monitor at regular interval and — depending on the monitor settings — return a **pass** or **fail** value to make sure an endpoint is still able to receive traffic.

      Each health monitor request is trying to answer two questions:

      1. **Is the endpoint offline?**: Does the endpoint respond to the health monitor request at all? If so, does it respond quickly enough (as specified in the monitor's **Timeout** field)?
      2. **Is the endpoint working as expected?**: Does the endpoint respond with the expected HTTP response codes? Does it include specific information in the response body?

      If the answer to either of these questions is "No", then the endpoint fails the health monitor request.
