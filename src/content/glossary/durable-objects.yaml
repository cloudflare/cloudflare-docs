productName: Durable Objects
entries:
- term: "Durable Objects"
  general_definition: |-
    The product name, or the collective noun referring to more than one Durable Object instance.

- term: "Namespace"
  general_definition: |-
    A container for a collection of Durable Objects that all share the same Durable Object (class) definition. A single Namespace can have (tens of) millions of Durable Objects. Metrics are scoped per Namespace.

- term: "Durable Object"
  general_definition: |-
    An individual Durable Object. A Durable Object is globally unique (referenced by ID), provides a global point of coordination for all methods/requests sent to it, and has private, persistent storage that is not shared with other Durable Objects within a Namespace.

- term: "Stub"
  general_definition: |-
    An object that refers to a unique Durable Object within a Namespace and allows you to call into that Durable Object via RPC methods or the `fetch` API. For example, `let stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(id)`

- term: "actor"
  general_definition: |-
    A term referring to a unique Durable Object.

- term: "instance"
  general_definition: |-
    See 'actor'.

- term: "Durable Object class"
  general_definition: |-
    The JavaScript class that defines the methods (RPC) and handlers (`fetch`, `alarm`) as part of your Durable Object, and/or an optional `constructor`. All Durable Objects within a single Namespace share the same class definition.

- term: "Storage Backend"
  general_definition: |-
    By default, a Durable Object class can use Storage API that leverages a key-value storage backend. New Durable Object classes can opt-in to using a [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sqlite-storage-backend).

- term: "Storage API"
  general_definition: |-
    The transactional and strongly consistent (serializable) [Storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) for persisting data within each Durable Object instance. State stored within a unique DO instance is "private" to that Durable Object, and not accessible from other Durable Objects.

    Storage API includes key-value (KV) API, SQL API, and point-in-time-recovery (PITR) API. 

    - Durable Object classes with the key-value storage backend can use KV API.
    - Durable Object classes with the SQLite storage backend can use KV API, SQL API, and PITR API.

- term: "KV API"
  general_definition: |-
    API methods part of Storage API that support persisting key-value data.

- term: "SQL API"
  general_definition: |-
    API methods part of Storage API that support SQL querying.

- term: Migration
  general_definition: |-
    A Durable Object migration is a mapping process from a class name to a runtime state.
    Initiate a Durable Object migration when you need to:

    - Create a new Durable Object class.
    - Rename a Durable Object class.
    - Delete a Durable Object class.
    - Transfer an existing Durable Objects class.

- term: Alarm
  general_definition: |-
    A Durable Object alarm is a mechanism that allows you to schedule the Durable Object to be woken up at a time in the future.
