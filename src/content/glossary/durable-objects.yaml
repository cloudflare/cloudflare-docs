productName: Durable Objects
entries:
  - term: "Durable Objects"
    general_definition: |-
      The product name, or the collective noun referring to more than one Durable Object instance.

  - term: "Namespace"
    general_definition: |-
      A container for a collection of Durable Objects that all share the same Durable Object (class) definition. A single Namespace can have (tens of) millions of Durable Objects. Metrics are scoped per Namespace.

  - term: "Durable Object"
    general_definition: |-
      An individual Durable Object. A Durable Object is globally unique (referenced by ID), provides a global point of coordination for all methods/requests sent to it, and has private, persistent storage that is not shared with other Durable Objects within a Namespace.

  - term: "Stub"
    general_definition: |-
      An object that refers to a unique Durable Object within a Namespace and allows you to call into that Durable Object via RPC methods or the `fetch` API. For example, `let stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(id)`

  - term: "actor"
    general_definition: |-
      A term referring to a unique Durable Object.

  - term: "instance"
    general_definition: |-
      See 'actor'.

  - term: "Durable Object class"
    general_definition: |-
      The JavaScript class that defines the methods (RPC) and handlers (`fetch`, `alarm`) as part of your Durable Object, and/or an optional `constructor`. All Durable Objects within a single Namespace share the same class definition.

  - term: "Storage Backend"
    general_definition: |-
      By default, a Durable Object class can use Storage API that leverages a key-value storage backend. New Durable Object classes can opt-in to using a [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sqlite-storage-backend).

  - term: "Storage API"
    general_definition: |-
      The transactional and strongly consistent (serializable) [Storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) for persisting data within each Durable Object instance. State stored within a unique DO instance is "private" to that Durable Object, and not accessible from other Durable Objects.

      Storage API includes key-value (KV) API, SQL API, and point-in-time-recovery (PITR) API.

      - Durable Object classes with the key-value storage backend can use KV API.
      - Durable Object classes with the SQLite storage backend can use KV API, SQL API, and PITR API.

  - term: "KV API"
    general_definition: |-
      API methods part of Storage API that support persisting key-value data.

  - term: "SQL API"
    general_definition: |-
      API methods part of Storage API that support SQL querying.

  - term: Migration
    general_definition: |-
      A Durable Object migration is a mapping process from a class name to a runtime state.
      Initiate a Durable Object migration when you need to:

      - Create a new Durable Object class.
      - Rename a Durable Object class.
      - Delete a Durable Object class.
      - Transfer an existing Durable Objects class.

  - term: Alarm
    general_definition: |-
      A Durable Object alarm is a mechanism that allows you to schedule the Durable Object to be woken up at a time in the future.
