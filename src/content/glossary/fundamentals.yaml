Additionally, CIDR notation includes a suffix that indicates the number of bits used for the network portion of the address. The format is typically written as "/X," where X is the number of bits in the network portion.

  - term: IP address
    general_definition: |-
      IP stands for Internet Protocol, which is the set of rules that makes it possible for devices to communicate over the Internet. With billions of people accessing the Internet every day, unique identifiers are necessary to keep track of who is doing what. The Internet Protocol solves this by assigning IP numbers to every device accessing the Internet. Every assigned number is an IP address.

  - term: two-factor authentication (2FA)
    general_definition: |-
      Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process in which a user provides two different authentication factors to verify their identity. In addition to something you know, typically your password, 2FA adds an extra layer of security to user logins by requiring users to also present something they have, such as Yubikey or a one-time login code, or something you are, such as a fingerprint.

      It adds an extra layer of security to user logins by requiring users to present two or more separate pieces of evidence (factors) that establish their identity.

  - term: TCP Keep-Alive
    general_definition: |-
      a TCP keep-alive is used to maintain a connection between two endpoints by sending packets to check if the connection is still active. This helps prevent idle connections from being prematurely closed. If a response is not received after a defined period, the connection is terminated.

  - term: TCP RST (reset)
    general_definition: |-
      a TCP Reset (RST) packet is used by a TCP sender to close a connection.

  - term: TCP Fast Open (TFO)
    general_definition: |-
      TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a protocol extension that can significantly improve the speed of establishing TCP connections by allowing data to be sent in the initial SYN packet, rather than requiring a separate handshake before data transmission begins.

  - term: TCP three-way handshake
    general_definition: |-
      TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) over an IP based connection. SYN is short for synchronize, and ACK is short for acknowledgement.

  - term: idle connection
    general_definition: |-
      when a TCP connection is in an idle state, it means that the connection has been established, but neither endpoint is sending any data. In the context of HTTP, an idle connection is when an established connection between a client and a server is not currently transmitting any HTTP requests or responses.
