entries:
  - term: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    general_definition: |-
      a connection-oriented protocol in the transport layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, providing reliable and ordered delivery of data between devices.

  - term: UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    general_definition: |-
      UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless transport layer protocol that provides fast and lightweight data transmission between devices on a network, prioritizing speed over reliability.

  - term: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
    general_definition: |-
      a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol often used for communication in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other resource-constrained scenarios.

  - term: proxy protocol
    general_definition: |-
      a protocol used by network proxies to convey client connection information to the destination server, facilitating proper handling of client requests.

  - term: reverse proxy
    general_definition: |-
      a server that handles requests on behalf of clients, forwarding them to backend servers and managing tasks like load balancing and security.

  - term: layer 3
    general_definition: |-
      the network layer in the OSI model, responsible for logical addressing, routing, and forwarding of data between devices on different networks.

  - term: layer 4
    general_definition: |-
      the transport layer in the OSI model, managing end-to-end communication, error-checking, and flow control.

  - term: OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection model)
    general_definition: |-
      a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

  - term: SYN (Synchronize)
    general_definition: |-
      the initial step in establishing a TCP connection, where a device requests a connection with another by sending a SYN packet.

  - term: SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)
    general_definition: |-
      the second step in the TCP three-way handshake, where the server responds to a SYN request with a SYN-ACK packet.

  - term: ACK (Acknowledge)
    general_definition: |-
      the final step in the TCP three-way handshake, confirming the establishment of a connection.

  - term: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
    general_definition: |-
      a standard network protocol used for transferring files from one host to another over a TCP-based network.

  - term: FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)
    general_definition: |-
      an extension of FTP that adds support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols.

  - term: SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
    general_definition: |-
      a secure file transfer protocol that uses the Secure Socket Shell (SSH) protocol for encryption and authentication.

  - term: SMTP Server (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Server)
    general_definition: |-
      a server responsible for sending, receiving, and relaying email messages over a network, following the SMTP protocol.
