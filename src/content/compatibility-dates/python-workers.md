This flag enables first class support for Python. [Python Workers](/workers/languages/python/) implement the majority of Python's [standard library](/workers/languages/python/stdlib), support all [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings), [environment variable](/workers/configuration/environment-variables), and [secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets), and integration with JavaScript objects and functions via a [foreign function interface](/workers/languages/python/ffi).
