AI Gateway allows you to securely export logs to an external storage location, where you can decrypt and process them.
You can toggle Logpush on and off in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) settings.

This guide explains how to set up Logpush for AI Gateway, generate an RSA key pair for encryption, and decrypt the logs once they are received.
Logpush has a limit of 4 jobs. If you have reached the [limit of logs stored for your plan](/ai-gateway/reference/limits/), logs will not be exported through Logpush.

:::note[Note]

To export logs using Logpush, you must have logs turned on for the gateway or have overridden the gateway settings by using the `cf-aig-collect-log` request header.

## Setting up Logpush

To configure Logpush for AI Gateway, follow these steps:

## 1. Generate an RSA key pair locally

You need to generate a key pair to encrypt and decrypt the logs. This script will output your RSA privateKey and publicKey. Keep the private key secure, as it will be used to decrypt the logs. Below is a sample script to generate the keys using Node.js.

```js title="JavaScript"
const crypto = require("crypto");

const { privateKey, publicKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync("rsa", {
	modulusLength: 4096,
	publicKeyEncoding: {
		type: "spki",
		format: "pem",
	},
	privateKeyEncoding: {
		type: "pkcs8",
		format: "pem",
	},
});

console.log(publicKey);
console.log(privateKey);
```

Run the script by executing the code below on your terminal. Where `file name` is the name of your JavaScript file.

```bash
node {file name}
```

This script will output your RSA privateKey and publicKey on your terminal. Keep the private key secure, as it will be used to decrypt the logs.

## 2. Upload public key to gateway settings

Once you have generated the key pair, upload the public key to your AI Gateway settings. This key will be used to encrypt your logs. For more information on Logpush refer to [Logs](/logs/get-started/).

:::note[Note]
You should enable Logpush in AI Gateway settings. This option only shows up when logs are enabled.
You can toggle on or off as needed. If you do not have logs turned on nothing will be saved.

## 3. Receive encrypted logs

After configuring Logpush, logs will be sent encrypted using the public key you uploaded. To access the data, you will need to decrypt it using your private key. The logs will be sent to the object storage provider that you have selected.

## 4. Decrypting logs

To decrypt the encrypted log bodies and metadata from AI Gateway, you can use the following Node.js script:

```js title="JavaScript"
const privateKey = `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
....
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`;

const crypto = require("crypto");
const key = crypto.createPrivateKey(privateKey);

const fs = require("fs");
const zlib = require("zlib");
const readline = require("readline");

function decryptBase64(key, string) {
	const decryptedData = crypto.privateDecrypt(
		{
			key: key,
			oaepHash: "SHA256",
		},
		Buffer.from(string, "base64"),
	);

	return decryptedData.toString();
}

let lineReader = readline.createInterface({
	input: fs.createReadStream("my_log.log.gz").pipe(zlib.createGunzip()),
});

lineReader.on("line", (line) => {
	line = JSON.parse(line);

	const { Metadata, RequestBody, ResponseBody, ...remaining } = line;

	console.log({
		...remaining,
		Metadata: decryptBase64(key, Metadata.data),
		RequestBody: decryptBase64(key, RequestBody.data),
		ResponseBody: decryptBase64(key, ResponseBody.data),
	});
	console.log("--");
});
```

## Script Explanation

The script reads the encrypted log file `(my_log.log.gz)`, decrypts the metadata, request body, and response body, and prints the decrypted data.
Ensure you replace the `privateKey` variable with your actual private RSA key that you generated in step 1.
