Providers may introduce new models or change their pricing. If you notice outdated cost data or are using a model not yet supported by our cost tracking, please [submit a request](https://forms.gle/8kRa73wRnvq7bxL48)

## Custom costs

AI Gateway allows users to set custom costs when operating under special pricing agreements or negotiated rates. Custom costs can be applied at the request level, and when applied, they will override the default or public model costs.
For more information on configuration of custom costs, please visit the [Custom Costs](/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-costs/) configuration page.
