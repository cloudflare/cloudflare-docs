Your AI Gateway dashboard shows metrics on requests, tokens, caching, errors, and cost. You can filter these metrics by time.
These analytics help you understand traffic patterns, token consumption, and
potential issues across different AI providers or individual providers. You can
view the following analytics:

- **Requests**: View the total number of requests processed by the AI Gateway.
- **Token Usage**: Analyze token consumption across all requests, giving insight into usage patterns and helping optimize token allocation.
- **Costs**: Gain visibility into the costs associated with using different AI providers. This allows you to track spending, manage budgets, and optimize your resources.
- **Error Rates**: Monitor the percentage of errors across requests, helping to identify and troubleshoot issues that may arise in provider responses.
- **Cached Responses**: View the percentage of responses served from cache.

You can use GraphQL to query your usage data outside of the AI Gateway dashboard. See the example query below. You will need to use your Cloudflare token when making the request, and change `{account_id}` to match your account tag.

```bash title="Request"
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/graphql \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "query": "query{\n  viewer {\n	accounts(filter: { accountTag: \"{account_id}\" }) {\n	requests: aiGatewayRequestsAdaptiveGroups(\n    	limit: $limit\n    	filter: { datetimeHour_geq: $start, datetimeHour_leq: $end }\n    	orderBy: [datetimeMinute_ASC]\n  	) {\n    	count,\n    	dimensions {\n        	model,\n        	provider,\n        	gateway,\n        	ts: datetimeMinute\n    	}\n    	\n  	}\n    	\n	}\n  }\n}",
    "variables": {
   	 "limit": 1000,
   	 "start": "2023-09-01T10:00:00.0Z",
   	 "end": "2023-09-30T10:00:00.0Z",
   	 "orderBy": "date_ASC"
    }
}'
```

:::note[Note]

The cost metric is an estimation based on the number of tokens sent and received in requests. While this metric can help you monitor and predict cost trends, refer to your providerâ€™s dashboard for the most accurate cost details.

## Logging

Your AI Gateway dashboard also shows real-time logs of individual requests, such as the prompt, response, provider, timestamps, and whether the request was successful, cached, or if there was an error. These logs now persist and can store up to 10,000 logs per gateway for better observability and analysis.
