Logging is a fundamental building block for application development. Logging provides insights during the early stages of development and is often critical to understanding issues occurring in production.

Your AI Gateway dashboard shows logs of individual requests, including the user prompt, model response, provider, timestamp, request status, token usage, cost, and duration. These logs persist, giving you the flexibility to store them for your preferred duration and do more with valuable request data. You can store up to 10 million logs per gateway.

When you are nearing your plan limit, an alert will be displayed in the dashboard. If your limit is reached, new logs will stop being saved. To continue saving logs, you must delete older logs to free up space for new logs.

To learn more about your plan limits, refer to the [Pricing](/ai-gateway/pricing/) page.

## Default configuration

Logs, which include metrics as well as request and response data are enabled by default for each gateway. If you are concerned about privacy or compliance and want to turn log collection off, you can go to settings and opt out of logs.

This logging behavior will be uniformly applied to all requests in the gateway. If you need to modify the logging settings for specific requests, you can override this setting on a per-request basis.

:::note[Note]

If you turn off logging and are using Logpush, this will prevent the response and request body from being forwarded through Logpush.

## Per-request logging

To override the default logging behavior set in the settings tab, you can define headers on a per-request basis.

## `collect_logs`

The `collect_logs` header allows you to bypass the default log setting for the gateway. If the gateway is configured to save logs, the header will exclude the user prompt and model response data for that specific request. Conversely, if logging is disabled at the gateway level, this header will save the user prompt and model response data for that request.

In this example, the gateway is configured to save logs, however we do not want this specific request to save the user prompt and model response.
