In this guide, you will learn how to create your first AI Gateway. You can create multiple gateways to control different applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need a Cloudflare account.

## Create gateway

Then, create a new AI Gateway.

## Connect application

Next, connect your AI provider to your gateway.

AI Gateway offers multiple endpoints for each Gateway you create - one endpoint per provider, and one Universal Endpoint.

If you do not have a provider preference, start with one of our dedicated tutorials.
