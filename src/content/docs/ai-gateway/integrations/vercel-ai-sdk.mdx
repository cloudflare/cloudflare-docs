The [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) is a TypeScript library for building AI applications. The SDK supports many different AI providers, tools for streaming completions, and more.

To use Cloudflare AI Gateway inside of the AI SDK, you can configure a custom "Gateway URL" for most supported providers. Below are a few examples of how it works.

## Examples

### OpenAI

If you're using the `openai` provider in AI SDK, you can create a customized setup with `createOpenAI`, passing your OpenAI-compatible AI Gateway URL:

```typescript
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const openai = createOpenAI({
	baseURL: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/openai`,
});
```

### Anthropic

If you're using the `anthropic` provider in AI SDK, you can create a customized setup with `createAnthropic`, passing your Anthropic-compatible AI Gateway URL:

```typescript
import { createAnthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

const anthropic = createAnthropic({
	baseURL: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/anthropic`,
});
```

### Other providers

For other providers that are not listed above, you can follow a similar pattern by creating a custom instance for any AI provider, and passing your AI Gateway URL. For help finding your provider-specific AI Gateway URL, refer to the [Supported providers page](/ai-gateway/providers).
