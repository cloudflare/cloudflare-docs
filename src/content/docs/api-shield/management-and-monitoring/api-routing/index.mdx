API Shield Routing enables customers to create a unified external-facing API that routes requests to different back-end services that may have different paths and hosts than the existing zone and DNS configuration.

:::note

The term **Source Endpoint** refers to the endpoint managed by API Shield in Endpoint Management. The term **Target Endpoint** refers to the ultimate destination the request is sent to by the Routing feature. 
:::

## Process

<Render file="source-endpoints" />

Once your Source Endpoints are added to Endpoint Management, use the following steps to create and verify routes on any given operation ID:

### Create a route

<Render file="routing" params={{ one: "Create", two: "route" }} />

<Render file="routing-path-variables" />

### Edit a route

<Render file="routing" params={{ one: "Edit", two: "routing" }} />

### Remove a route

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Select **Security** > **API Shield**.
3. In **Endpoint Management**, select an existing endpoint and expand its details.
4. Under **Routing**, select **Edit routing**.
5. Select **Delete route**.

### Test a route

After sending a request to your Source Endpoint, you should see the contents of the back-end service as if you called the Target Endpoint directly.

If API Shield returns unexpected results, check your Source Endpoint host, method, and path and [verify the Route](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/api-routing/#verify-a-route) to ensure the Target Endpoint value is correct.

:::note

You may need to wait up to five minutes for Route changes to synchronize across the Cloudflare network.
