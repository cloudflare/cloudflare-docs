API Gateway is a package of features that will do everything for your APIs, including:

- **Security**: Protect your API from malicious traffic with [API Discovery](/api-shield/security/api-discovery/), [Schema Validation](/api-shield/security/schema-validation/), [mTLS validation](/api-shield/security/mtls/), and more.
- **Management and monitoring**: Streamline API management with [Endpoint Management](/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/) and [tools](https://blog.cloudflare.com/api-gateway/) like analytics, routing, and authentication.
- **Logging, quota management, and more**: All of Cloudflare's [established features](https://blog.cloudflare.com/api-gateway/), like caching, load balancing, and log integrations work natively with API Gateway.
