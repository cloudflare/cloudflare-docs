Cloudflare helps Channel and Alliance partners manage their and their customers' accounts through a Tenant structure.

![Partner accounts contain a tenant, which is a container for customer accounts and zones. For more details, keep reading.](~/assets/images/tenant/tenant-diagram.png)

## Tenants and Tenant admins

<Render file="tenant-definition" />

<Render file="tenant-admin-definition" />

## Accounts, users, and resources

This Tenant structure gives your account streamlined administrative access to customer:

* Accounts[^1]
* Users[^2]
* Resources[^3]

At the same time, this structure keeps your customers' data and settings separate from each other.

[^1]: <Render file="account-definition" />

[^2]: <Render file="user-definition" />

[^3]: <Render file="resource-definition" />
