If your domain has content that has been blocked, Blocked Content on the dashboard gives you the ability to request the Trust and Safety team to remove a block.

To view Blocked Content on the dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Security Center** > **Blocked Content**.

:::note
You must have Admin, Super Admin or Trust and Safety [role](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/) to access Blocked Content.
:::

The Security Center dashboard displays three statuses for blocked content: active, pending, or resolved blocks.

## Active blocks

An active block is a block that is in effect on blocking content.

When you select **Request Review**, the status changes to **In Review**, and the block will be reviewed by the Trust and Safety team.

## Pending blocks

A pending block represents a blocking action Cloudflare will take at the scheduled time.

You can view all your pending blocks by selecting **Pending** on the dashboard. Selecting **Request Review** cancels the pending delayed action. This means that the block will not be placed.

## Resolved blocks

Resolved blocks list your recently resolved blocks. Resolved blocks are limited to 30 days of recently resolved blocks. Resolved blocks require no action. You can only sort and/or filter the list.
