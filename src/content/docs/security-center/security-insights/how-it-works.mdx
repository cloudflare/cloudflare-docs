Once you [enable Security Insights](/security-center/get-started/), Cloudflare runs regular security scans on the infrastructure associated with your Cloudflare account. These scans perform a series of checks on your Cloudflare account settings and on the configurations of different Cloudflare products for the domains in your Cloudflare account.

The performed checks take into account a set of ideal product configurations and states that indicate a good security posture. If your current configuration does not meet this ideal configuration for one or more checks, the Security Center will report these situations as **Security Insights**.

The list of insights may include potential security threats, vulnerabilities, compliance risks, insecure configurations, or any other identified risks.

:::note
Security Insights will check non-proxied hostnames.
