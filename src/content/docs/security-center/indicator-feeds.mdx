Cloudflare's threat intelligence team crowdsources attack trends and protects users automatically, such as from zero-day vulnerabilities like the [HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/). However, in some cases, Cloudflare will partner with external entities that have their own feeds which can be shared with eligible Cloudflare users.

With Custom Indicator Feeds, Cloudflare provides a threat intelligence feed based on data received from various Cyber Defense Collaboration groups. The security filtering capabilities are available to eligible public and private sector organizations.

## Publicly available feeds

Cloudflare provides some feeds to Gateway users without the need to establish a provider relationship.

## Get started

<Render file="indicator-feeds-overview" />

If your organization is interested in becoming a provider or a subscriber, contact your account team.

### Create a Custom Indicator Feed

Providers can create and manage a Custom Indicator Feed with the [Custom Indicator Feeds API endpoints](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-get-indicator-feeds):

1. Contact your account team to configure your account as an indicator feed provider.
2. Create a feed with the [Create new indicator feed endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-create-indicator-feeds). Make note of the `feed_id` generated for your feed. For example:

   ```bash title="Create new indicator feed"
   curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/intel/indicator-feeds" \
   	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>' \
   	--data '{
   	"description": "Custom indicator feed to detect threats",
   	"name": "threat_indicator_feed"
   }'
   ```

   ```json output {3}
   {
   	"result": {
   		"id": 10,
   		"name": "threat_indicator_feed",
   		"description": "Custom indicator feed to detect threats",
   		"created_on": "2024-09-17T21:16:09.412Z",
   		"modified_on": "2024-09-17T21:16:09.412Z"
   	},
   	"success": true,
   	"errors": [],
   	"messages": []
   }
   ```

3. Upload data to the feed with the [Update indicator feed data endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-update-indicator-feed-data). Uploaded indicator data must be in a [`.stix2`](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) formatted file.

   ```bash title="Update indicator feed data"
   curl --request PUT \
   	"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/intel/indicator-feeds/<FEED_ID>/snapshot" \
   	--header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>' \
   	--form 'source=@/path/to/file'
   ```

   ```json output
   {
   	"result": {
   		"file_id": 1,
   		"filename": "snapshot_file.unified",
   		"status": "unified"
   	},
   	"errors": [],
   	"messages": [],
   	"success": true
   }
   ```

   :::note
   Indicator feeds use a snapshot system. To update feeds with new data, providers must upload a file containing all previous and new indicators.
   :::

4. (Optional) Verify the status of your feed upload with the [Get indicator feed data endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-get-indicator-feed-data). For example:

   ```bash title="Get indicator feed data"
   curl --request GET \
   	"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/intel/indicator-feeds/<FEED_ID>/data" \
   	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>'
   ```

   ```json output {8}
   {
   	"result": {
   		"id": 10,
   		"name": "threat_indicator_feed",
   		"description": "Custom indicator feed to detect threats",
   		"created_on": "2023-08-01T18:00:26.65715Z",
   		"modified_on": "2023-08-01T18:00:26.65715Z",
   		"latest_upload_status": "Complete"
   	},
   	"success": true,
   	"errors": [],
   	"messages": []
   }
   ```

5. Grant access to subscribers with the [Grant permission to indicator feed endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-add-permission). You can add subscribers to the feed's allowed subscribers list using their [account IDs](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/). For example:

   ```bash title="Update indicator feed data"
   curl --request PUT \
   	"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/intel/indicator-feeds/<FEED_ID>/snapshot" \
   	--header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
   	--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>' \
   	--data '{
   	"account_tag": "823f45f16fd2f7e21e1e054aga4d2859",
   	"feed_id": 10
   }'
   ```

### Use a feed in Gateway

Once an account is granted access to a feed, it will be available to match traffic as a [selector in Gateway DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#indicator-feeds).

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies**. Select **DNS**.
2. To create a new DNS policy, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name your policy.
4. In **Traffic**, add a condition with the **Indicator Feeds** selector. If your account has been granted access to a Custom Indicator Feed, Gateway will list the feed in **Value**. For example, you can block sites that appear in a feed:

   | Selector        | Operator | Value               | Action |
   | --------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------ |
   | Indicator Feeds | in       | _Threat Intel Feed_ | Block  |

5. Select **Create policy**.

For more information on creating Gateway policies, refer to [DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/).
