### Start a new scan

To manually start a scan:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to Account Home > **Security Center** > **Infrastructure**.
3. Select **Scan now**.

### Scan Frequency

Once you enable Security Insights, Cloudflare performs scans at a [regular frequency](/security-center/security-insights/how-it-works/#scan-frequency), according to your Cloudflare plan.
