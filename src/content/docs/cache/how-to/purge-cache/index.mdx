Cloudflare offers different options to purge your content. Although single-file cache purging (purge by URL) is recommended, the following options are also available:

<DirectoryListing />

<FeatureTable id="cache.purge_cache" />

Purge requests appear in Cloudflare Logs and are identified by the `PURGE` method and the Cloudflare-branded User Agent.
