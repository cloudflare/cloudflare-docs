* **When incoming requests match**: Custom filter expression
  * Using the Expression Builder:<br/>
    `Hostname contains "example.com" AND Cookie contains "test-cookie"`
  * Using the Expression Editor:<br/>
    `(http.host contains "example.com" and http.cookie contains "test-cookie")`

* **Then**:
  * **Cache eligibility**: Bypass cache

</Example>
