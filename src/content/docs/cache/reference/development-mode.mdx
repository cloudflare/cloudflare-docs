Development Mode temporarily suspends Cloudflare's edge caching and [Polish](/images/polish/) features for three hours unless disabled beforehand. Development Mode allows customers to immediately observe changes to their cacheable content like images, CSS, or JavaScript.

:::note

To bypass cache for longer than three hours, use bypass cache in [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#bypass-cache).
