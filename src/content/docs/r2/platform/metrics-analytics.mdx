title: Metrics and analytics

---

R2 exposes analytics that allow you to inspect the requests and storage of the buckets in your account.

The metrics displayed for a bucket in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are queried from Cloudflare’s [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

R2 currently has two datasets:

| <div style="width:100px">Dataset  </div> | <div style="width:235px">GraphQL Dataset Name </div> | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operations                               | `r2OperationsAdaptiveGroups`                         | This dataset consists of the operations taken buckets of an account. |
| Storage                                  | `r2StorageAdaptiveGroups`                            | This dataset consists of the storage of buckets an account.          |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days. These datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID.

## View via the dashboard

Per-bucket analytics for R2 are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a bucket:

2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
3. Go to the [R2 tab](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2) and select your bucket.
4. Select the **Metrics** tab.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your R2 buckets via the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same dataset as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

## Examples

### Operations

To query the volume of each operation type on a bucket for a given time period you can run a query as such

```graphql
query {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountId }) {
			r2OperationsAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					datetime_geq: $startDate
					datetime_leq: $endDate
					bucketName: $bucketName
				}
			) {
				sum {
					requests
				}
				dimensions {
					actionType
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The `bucketName` field can be removed to get an account level overview of operations. The volume of operations can be broken down even further by adding more dimensions to the query.

### Storage

To query the storage of a bucket over a given time period you can run a query as such.

```graphql
query {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountId }) {
			r2StorageAdaptiveGroups(
				limit: 10000
				filter: {
					datetime_geq: $startDate
					datetime_leq: $endDate
					bucketName: $bucketName
				}
				orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
			) {
				max {
					objectCount,
					uploadCount,
					payloadSize,
					metadataSize
				}
				dimensions {
					datetime
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
