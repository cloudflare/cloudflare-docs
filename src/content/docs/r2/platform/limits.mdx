## Rate limiting on managed public buckets through `r2.dev`

Managed public bucket access through an `r2.dev` subdomain is not intended for production usage and has a rate limit applied to it. If you exceed the rate limit, requests through your `r2.dev` subdomain will be temporarily throttled and you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. For production use cases, consider linking a [custom domain](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#custom-domains) to your bucket.

| Feature                           | Limit                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Bucket                            | 1000 buckets per account     |
| Data storage per bucket           | Unlimited                    |
| Object key length                 | 1,024 bytes                  |
| Object metadata size              | 8,192 bytes                  |
| Object size                       | 5 TiB per object<sup>1</sup> |
| Maximum upload size<sup>3</sup>   | 5 GiB<sup>2</sup>            |
| Maximum upload parts              | 10,000                       |
| Maximum custom domains per bucket | 50                           |



<sup>1</sup> The object size limit is 5 GiB less than 5 TiB, so 4.995 TiB.<br/> <sup>2</sup> The max upload size is 5 MiB less than 5 GiB, so 4.995 GiB.<br/> <sup>3</sup> Max upload size applies to uploading a file via one request, uploading a part of a multipart upload, or copying into a part of a multipart upload. If you have a Worker, its inbound request size is
constrained by [Workers request limits](/workers/platform/limits#request-limits). The max upload size limit does not apply to subrequests.<br/>
Review the [Examples](/r2/examples/) on how to use the SDKs.<br/>

Limits specified in MiB (mebibyte), GiB (gibibyte), or TiB (tebibyte) are storage units of measurement based on base-2. 1 GiB (gibibyte) is equivalent to 2<sup>30</sup> bytes (or 1024<sup>3</sup> bytes). This is distinct from 1 GB (gigabyte), which is 10<sup>9</sup> bytes (or 1000<sup>3</sup> bytes).

## Caching

Currently Cloudflare's [Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) feature is not compatible with responses from R2. These responses will act as if Tiered Cache is not configured.
