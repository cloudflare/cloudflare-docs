Event notifications send messages to your [queue](/queues/) when data in your R2 bucket changes. You can consume these messages with a [consumer Worker](/queues/reference/how-queues-works/#create-a-consumer-worker) or [pull over HTTP](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) from outside of Cloudflare Workers.

:::note[Open Beta]


The event notifications feature is currently in open beta. To report bugs or request features, go to the #r2-storage channel in the [Cloudflare Developer Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com) or fill out the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/2HBKD9zG9PFiU4v79).

## Get started with event notifications

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need:

* An existing R2 bucket. If you do not already have an existing R2 bucket, refer to [Create buckets](/r2/buckets/create-buckets/).
* An existing queue. If you do not already have a queue, refer to [Create a queue](/queues/get-started/#3-create-a-queue).
* A [consumer Worker](/queues/reference/how-queues-works/#create-a-consumer-worker) or [HTTP pull](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) enabled on your Queue.

### Set up Wrangler

To begin, refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#install-wrangler) to install Wrangler, the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI. Log into Wrangler with the [`wrangler login` command](/workers/wrangler/commands/#login).

### Enable event notifications on your R2 bucket

To enable event notifications, add an event notification rule to your bucket by running the [`r2 bucket notification create` command](/workers/wrangler/commands/#notification-create). Event notification rules determine the [event types](/r2/buckets/event-notifications/#event-types) that trigger notifications and enable filtering based on object `prefix` and `suffix`.

```sh
$ npx wrangler r2 bucket notification create <BUCKET_NAME> --event-type <EVENT_TYPE> --queue <QUEUE_NAME>
```

For a more complete step-by-step example, refer to the [Log and store upload events in R2 with event notifications](/r2/examples/upload-logs-event-notifications/) example.

## Message format

Queue consumers receive notifications as [Messages](/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#message). The following is an example of the body of a message that a consumer Worker will receive:

```json
{
  "account": "3f4b7e3dcab231cbfdaa90a6a28bd548",
  "action": "CopyObject",
  "bucket": "my-bucket",
  "object": {
    "key": "my-new-object",
    "size": 65536,
    "eTag": "c846ff7a18f28c2e262116d6e8719ef0"
  },
  "eventTime": "2024-05-24T19:36:44.379Z",
  "copySource": {
    "bucket": "my-bucket",
    "object": "my-original-object"
  }
}
```

## Limitations

During the beta, event notifications has the following limitations:

* Queues [per-queue message throughput](/queues/platform/limits/) is currently 400 messages per second. If your workload produces more than 400 notifications per second, messages may be dropped.
* For a given bucket, only one event notification rule can be created per queue.
* Each bucket can have up to 5 event notification rules.
* Deletes that occur as a result of object lifecycle policies will not trigger an event notification.
* Event notifications are not available for buckets with [jursdictional restrictions](/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions).
