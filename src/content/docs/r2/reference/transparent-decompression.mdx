R2 supports transparent decompression, which allows users to store compressed versions of their files while serving an uncompressed files to users.

When possible, Cloudflare will always request compressed content. Cloudflare supports gzip, Brotli (br), and no compression when requesting content from your origin server.

Transparent decompression occurs when the file stored in R2 is compressed or when an object's metadata includes the `Content-Encoding` response header.

If a compression type is not specified in the `Accept-Encoding` request header, the content is decompressed during the request.
