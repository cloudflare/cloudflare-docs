## Delete objects via Wrangler

:::caution

Deleting objects from a bucket is irreversible.

:::

You can delete an object directly by calling `delete` against a `{bucket}/{path/to/object}`.

For example, to delete the object `foo.png` from bucket `test-bucket`:

```sh
wrangler r2 object delete test-bucket/foo.png
```

```sh output

Deleting object "foo.png" from bucket "test-bucket".
Delete complete.
```
