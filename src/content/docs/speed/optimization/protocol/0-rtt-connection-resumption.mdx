Zero round trip time resumption (0-RTT) improves performance for clients who have previously connected to your website.

This feature particularly benefits end users who visit your application regularly or who use mobile networks.

For more details on what 0-RTT is, how it works, and potential limitations, refer to [our blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/even-faster-connection-establishment-with-quic-0-rtt-resumption/).

## Availability

## Enable 0-RTT Connection Resumption

By default, 0-RTT Connection Resumption is not enabled on your Cloudflare application.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="dashboard">

To enable 0-RTT Connection Resumption in the dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and go to a specific domain.
2. Navigate to **Speed > Optimization**.
3. Navigate to the **Protocol Optimization** tab and under **0-RTT Connection Resumption**, switch the toggle to **On**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

To adjust your 0-RTT Connection Resumption settings with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) request with `0rtt` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"on"` or `"off"`.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::note
The 0-RTT Connection Resumption is only established between the client and Cloudflare. It does not extend to the origin server.
