title: Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization negatively affects iOS/Safari devices

---

Occasionally, [Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization](/speed/optimization/protocol/enhanced-http2-prioritization/) can negatively affect the experience of visitors using Safari on macOS or any browser on iOS.

These visitors may notice not being able to load the site properly, such as images not displaying or content taking too long to load.

## Solution

If visitors using using Safari on macOS or any browser on iOS are experiencing issues with your site loading properly, try [disabling Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization](/speed/optimization/protocol/enhanced-http2-prioritization/#enable-enhanced-http2-prioritization).

:::note


Sometimes, [HTTP/2](/speed/optimization/protocol/http2/) will cause **Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization** to be re-enabled automatically.

If you notice this happening, also disable **HTTP/2**.
