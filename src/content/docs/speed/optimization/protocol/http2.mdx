HTTP/2 uses the TCP transport protocol and TLS to secure communications and improves page load times.

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="speed.http2" />

## Enable HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is enabled by default for all plans (though it does require an [SSL certificate at Cloudflareâ€™s edge network](/ssl/get-started/)).

## Disable HTTP/2

Domains on Free plans cannot disable Cloudflare's HTTP/2 setting.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To disable **HTTP/2** in the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Speed** > **Optimization**.
4. Go to **Protocol Optimization**.
5. For **HTTP/2**, switch the toggle to **Off**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To disable **HTTP/2** with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) request with `http2` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"off"`.
