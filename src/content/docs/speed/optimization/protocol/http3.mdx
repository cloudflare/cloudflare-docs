HTTP/3 uses QUIC, which is a secure-by-default transport protocol. HTTP/3 improves page load times in a similar way to HTTP/2. However, the QUIC transport protocol solves TCP's head-of-line blocking problem, meaning that performance over lossy networks can be better.

## Enable HTTP/3

HTTP/3 is available to all plans (though it does require an [SSL certificate at Cloudflareâ€™s edge network](/ssl/get-started/)).

To enable **HTTP/3** in the dashboard:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Speed** > **Optimization**.
4. Go to **Protocol Optimization**.
5. For **HTTP/3**, switch the toggle to **On**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

To enable **HTTP/3** with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) request with `http3` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"on"`.

</TabItem> </Tabs>
