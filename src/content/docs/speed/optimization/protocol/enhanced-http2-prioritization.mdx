With Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization, Cloudflare delivers resources in the optimal order for the fastest experience across all browsers. It also supports control of content delivery when used in conjunction with [Workers](/workers/).

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="speed.enhanced_http2_prioritization" />

## How it works

The speed of loading web content, from the userâ€™s perspective, is dependent on the order in which the resources load. With HTTP/2, by default, Cloudflare will follow the order requested by the browser. This ordering varies from browser to browser, causing a significant difference in performance.

With Enhanced HTTP/2 Prioritization, Cloudflare overrides the default browser behavior to optimize the order of resource delivery, independent of the browser. The greatest improvements will be experienced by visitors using Safari and Edge browsers.
