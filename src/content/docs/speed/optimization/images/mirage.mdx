Cloudflare Mirage reduces bandwidth used by images in mobile browsers. It can accelerate loading of image-heavy websites on very slow mobile connections and HTTP/1.

It does this by:

* Replacing images with low-resolution thumbnails, which are bundled together into one file.
* Acting as a lazy loader, deferring loading of higher-resolution images until they become visible.

JavaScript must be enabled for Mirage to work.

***

## Comparison

* [Polish](/images/polish/) seamlessly optimizes images for all browsers, not only mobile, and keeps images at full resolution.
* [Image Resizing](/images/transform-images/) together with `loading="lazy"` and `srcset` HTML attributes can achieve similar results as Mirage, but requires markup changes to implement.

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="speed.mirage" />

***

## Image formats compatible with Mirage

Mirage will work with the following image formats:

* `.jpg`
* `.jpeg`
* `.png`
* `.gif`
* `.img`

## Enable Mirage

:::note

If you send a <GlossaryTooltip term="content security policy (CSP)">Content Security Policy (CSP)</GlossaryTooltip> header that restricts where scripts can be loaded, you will need to ensure `ajax.cloudflare.com` is enabled. For example, to allow scripts from your own domain and `ajax.cloudflare.com` enter the following:
`script-src 'self' ajax.cloudflare.com;` 
:::

To enable Mirage image optimization for your entire domain:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Speed** > **Optimization** > **Image Optimization**.
4. For **Mirage**, switch the toggle to **On**.

## Test Mirage

Mirage's features for Mobile Browser optimization are triggered based on high latency and poor network connections. You can test Mirage by making a request to your domain using a mobile [user-agent string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) and one of the following flags with your domain in your mobile browser:

`EXAMPLE.COM/?forcepreload`

To run the pre-loader only and serve degraded images on the page enter:

`EXAMPLE.COM/?forcepreloadonly`

Here is an example where Mirage 2 is triggered by a `?forcepreloadonly` flag. The notable image degradation is a sign that Mirage is working:
