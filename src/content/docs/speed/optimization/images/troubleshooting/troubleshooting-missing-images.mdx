title: Troubleshoot missing images

---

If images are missing from your website, other Cloudflare features may be interfering with those images.

To troubleshoot:

1. Perform one of the following actions:

   * [Purge cache](/cache/how-to/purge-cache) for the URL of the missing image file.
   * [Temporarily pause Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/).
   * Disable [Rocket Loader](/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/enable/).
   * Disable [Mirage](/speed/optimization/images/mirage/#enable-mirage).
2. Retest the image load in a private browser tab.
3. If the issue is not fixed, try another of the actions suggested in Step 1.
