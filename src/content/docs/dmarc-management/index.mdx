Cloudflare DMARC Management (beta) helps you track every source that is sending emails from your domain and review [Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/) reports for each source. DMARC reports will help you understand if messages sent from your domain are passing DMARC authentication, [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/) authentication, and [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/) policies.

DMARC Management (beta) is available to all Cloudflare customers with [Cloudflare DNS](/dns/).
