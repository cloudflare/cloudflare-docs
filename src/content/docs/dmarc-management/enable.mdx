You need to enable DMARC Management to allow Cloudflare to process DMARC reports on your behalf. DMARC Management only works with <GlossaryTooltip term="apex domain">apex domains</GlossaryTooltip> and not domains in [subdomain setups](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/).

:::caution[A warning on DMARC Management and SPF records]

DMARC Management does not support actions on SPF records when your zone has a CNAME record that points to a different domain. Changing the SPF record would make DMARC rules invalid, as Cloudflare cannot change other DNS records to reflect your updates.
:::

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **DMARC Management**.
3. Select **Enable DMARC Management**.
4. DMARC Management will scan your zone for DMARC records.

   1. If no record is found, Cloudflare will automatically invite you to add one that you can edit later. Select **Add** to continue.
   2. If there is a DMARC record in your zone, Cloudflare will add another `rua` entry to it. This additional `rua` tag has a Cloudflare email address and is needed for Cloudflare to be able to start processing DMARC reports on your behalf. Select **Next** to continue.

DMARC Management (beta) is now active. However, it may take up to 24 hours to receive your first DMARC report and to display this information in DMARC Management.
