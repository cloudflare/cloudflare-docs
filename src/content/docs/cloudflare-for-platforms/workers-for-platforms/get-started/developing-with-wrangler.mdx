import { Render, PackageManagers } from "~/components";

To test your [Dispatch Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker), [user Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers) and [Outbound Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/outbound-workers/) before deploying to production, you can use [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler) for development and testing.

:::note

Support for Workers for Platforms with `wrangler dev` in local mode is experimental and may change in the future. Use the prerelease branch: `wrangler@dispatch-namespaces-dev` to try Workers for Platforms locally.
:::

## 1. Create a user worker

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"customer-worker-1"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World Worker",
		lang: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

Then, move into the newly created directory:

```sh
cd customer-worker-1
```

Update the `src/index.js` file for customer-worker-1:

```javascript
export default {
	async fetch(request) {
		// make a subrequest to the internet
		const response = await fetch("https://example.com");
		return new Response(
			`user worker got "${await response.text()}" from fetch`,
		);
	},
};
```

Update the [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file for customer-worker-1 and add the dispatch namespace:

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
# ... other content above ...

dispatch_namespace = "my-namespace"
```

</WranglerConfig>

## 2. Create a dispatch worker

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"dispatch-worker"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World Worker",
		lang: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

Then, move into the newly created directory:

```sh
cd dispatch-worker
```

Update the `src/index.js` file for dispatch-worker:

```javascript
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		// get the user Worker, specifying parameters that the Outbound Worker will see when it intercepts a user worker's subrequest
		const customerScript = env.DISPATCH_NAMESPACE.get(
			"customer-worker-1",
			{},
			{
				outbound: {
					paramCustomerName: "customer-1",
				},
			},
		);
		// invoke user Worker
		return await customerScript.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

Update the [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file for dispatch-worker and add the dispatch namespace binding:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
# ... other content above ...

[[dispatch_namespaces]]
binding = "DISPATCH_NAMESPACE"
namespace = "my-namespace"
outbound = { service = "outbound-worker", parameters = ["paramCustomerName"] }
```

</WranglerConfig>

## 3. Create an Outbound Worker

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"outbound-worker"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World Worker",
		lang: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

Then, move into the newly created directory:

```sh
cd outbound-worker
```

Update the `src/index.js` file for outbound-worker:

```javascript
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const { paramCustomerName } = env;
		// use the parameters passed by the dispatcher to know what this user this request is for
		// and return custom content back to the user worker
		return new Response(
			`intercepted a request for ${paramCustomerName} by the outbound`,
		);
	},
};
```

## 4. Start local dev session for your Workers

In separate terminals, start a local dev session for each of your Workers.

For your dispatcher Worker:

```sh
cd dispatch-worker
npx wrangler@dispatch-namespaces-dev dev --port 8600
```

For your outbound Worker:

```sh
cd outbound-worker
npx wrangler@dispatch-namespaces-dev dev --port 8601
```

And for your user Worker:

```sh
cd customer-worker-1
npx wrangler@dispatch-namespaces-dev dev --port 8602
```

## 5. Test your requests

Send a request to your dispatcher Worker:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8600
```

```sh output
# -> user worker got "intercepted a request for customer-1 by the outbound" from fetch
```
