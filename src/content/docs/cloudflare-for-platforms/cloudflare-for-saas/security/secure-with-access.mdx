Cloudflare Access provides visibility and control over who has access to your [custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/). You can allow or block users based on identity, device posture, and other [Access rules](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).

## Prerequisites

* You must have an active custom hostname. For setup instructions, refer to [Configuring Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/).
* You must have a Cloudflare Zero Trust plan in your SaaS provider account. Learn more about [getting started with Zero Trust](/cloudflare-one/setup/).
* You can only run Access on custom hostnames if they are managed externally to Cloudflare or in a separate Cloudflare account. If the custom hostname zone is in the same account as the SaaS zone, the Access application will not be applied.

## Setup

1. At your SaaS provider account, select [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **Access** > **Applications**.
3. Select **Add an application** and, for type of application, select **Self-hosted**.
4. Enter a name for your Access application and, in **Session Duration**, choose how often the user's [application token](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/application-token/) should expire.
5. In the **Domain** field, insert the custom hostname (for example, `mycustomhostname.com`) and press enter. The custom hostname will not appear in the dropdown and must be manually entered.
    :::caution[Domain field validation]
    Since the custom hostname zone must be managed externally to Cloudflare or in a separate Cloudflare account, it is expected that you find a validation warning `Zone is not associated with the current account`. You can proceed with the configuration despite this message.
    :::
6. Follow the remaining [self-hosted application creation steps](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) to publish the application.
