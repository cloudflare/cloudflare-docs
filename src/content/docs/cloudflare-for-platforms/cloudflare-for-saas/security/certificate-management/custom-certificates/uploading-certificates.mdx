import { Render } from "~/components"

For use cases and limitations, refer to [custom certificates](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/custom-certificates/).

:::caution

You can only use one of the different [supported types](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/custom-certificates/#limitations). For example, you cannot upload an `SHA256WithRSA` + `ECDSAWithSHA256` certificate.
:::

## Upload certificates

### With the dashboard

To upload a custom certificate in the dashboard, follow the steps for [issuing new certificates](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/issue-certificates/), but change the **Certificate type** to **Custom certificate**.

For more details on bundle method, refer to [Bundle Methodologies](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/bundling-methodologies/)

### With the API

The call below will upload a certificate for use with `app.example.com`.

Note that if you are using an ECC key generated by OpenSSL, you will need to first remove the `-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----...-----END EC PARAMETERS-----` section of the file.

#### 1. Update the file and build the payload

<Render file="custom-cert-file-example" product="ssl" />

```bash
$ echo $MYCERT
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIFJDCCBAygAwIBAgIQD0ifmj/Yi5NP/2gdUySbfzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBN\nMQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEVMBMGA1UEChMMRGlnaUNlcnQgSW5jMScwJQYDVQQDEx5E...SzSHfXp5lnu/3V08I72q1QNzOCgY1XeL4GKVcj4or6cT6tX6oJH7ePPmfrBfqI/O\nOeH8gMJ+FuwtXYEPa4hBf38M5eU5xWG7\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n

$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
  "hostname": "app.example.com",
  "ssl": {
    "custom_certificate": "$MYCERT",
    "custom_key": "$MYKEY"
  }
}
EOF
))
```

#### 2. Upload your certificate and key

Use a [POST request](/api/operations/custom-hostname-for-a-zone-create-custom-hostname) to upload your certificate and key.

The serial number returned is unique to the issuer, but not globally unique. Additionally, it is returned as a string, not an integer.

***

## Move to a Cloudflare certificate

If you want to switch from maintaining a custom certificate to using one issued by Cloudflare, you can migrate that certificate with zero downtime.

Send a [PATCH request](/api/operations/custom-hostname-for-a-zone-edit-custom-hostname) to your custom hostname with a value for the DCV `method`. As soon as the [certificate is validated](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/) and the [hostname is validated](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/), Cloudflare will remove the old custom certificate and begin serving the new one.
