:::caution


With the [upcoming change](/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/custom-hostname-certificates/) to certificates issued by DigiCert, CNAME DCV will soon be unsupported.


:::

Since this method is only available using the API, you need to make a [POST request](/api/operations/custom-hostname-for-a-zone-create-custom-hostname) and set a `"method":"cname"` parameter.

Within the `ssl` object in the response, refer to the values present in the `validation_records` array. Each record will contain a property for `cname` and `cname_target` (you can also access these values in the dashboard by clicking that specific hostname certificate). Provide these values to your customer so they can add a CNAME record at their authoritative DNS provider.
