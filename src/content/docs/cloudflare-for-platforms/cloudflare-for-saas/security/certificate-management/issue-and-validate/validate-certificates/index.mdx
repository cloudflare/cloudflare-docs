:::caution


With the [upcoming change](/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/custom-hostname-certificates/) to certificates issued by DigiCert, both [email](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/email/) and [CNAME](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/cname/) DCV will soon be unsupported.

## DCV situations

### Non-wildcard certificates

<Render file="http-dcv-situation" />

### Wildcard certificates

<Render file="txt-dcv-situation" /> <br/>

* [DCV Delegation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/delegated-dcv/) (auto-issuance)
* [Manual](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/txt/)

### Minimize downtime

If you want to minimize downtime, explore one of the following methods to issue and deploy the certificate before onboarding your customers:

* [Delegated DCV](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/delegated-dcv/): Place a one-time record at your authoritative DNS that allows Cloudflare to auto-renew all future certificate orders.
* [TXT validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/txt/): Have your customers add a `TXT` record to their authoritative DNS.
* [Manual HTTP validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/http/#http-manual): Add a `TXT` record at your origin.

### Minimize customer effort

If you value simplicity and your customers can handle a few minutes of downtime, you can rely on Cloudflare [automatic HTTP validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/http/#http-automatic).
