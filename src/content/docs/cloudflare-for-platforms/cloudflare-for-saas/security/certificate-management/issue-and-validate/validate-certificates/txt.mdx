## When to use

Generally, you should use TXT-based DCV when you cannot use [HTTP validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/http/) or [Delegated DCV](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/delegated-dcv/).

### Non-wildcard custom hostnames

If your custom hostname does not include a wildcard, Cloudflare will always and automatically attempt to complete DCV through [HTTP validation](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/http/#http-automatic), even if you have selected **TXT** for your validation method.

This HTTP validation should succeed as long as your customer is pointing to your custom hostname and they do not have any [CAA records](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/troubleshooting/#certificate-authority-authorization-caa-records) blocking your chosen certificate authority.

### Wildcard custom hostnames

<Render file="wildcard-hostname-reqs" />

This means that - if you choose to use wildcard custom hostnames - you will need a way to share these DCV tokens with your customer.

---

### 1. Get TXT tokens

Once you [create a new hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/issue-certificates/) and choose this validation method, your tokens will be ready after a few seconds.

<Render file="txt-validation_preamble" />

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="txt-validation_api" />

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="txt-validation_dashboard" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### 2. Share with your customer

You will then need to share these TXT tokens with your customers.

### 3. Add DNS records (customer)

<Render file="txt-validation_post" />

<Render file="ssl-for-saas-validate-patch" />

### 4. (Optional) Fetch new tokens

Your DCV tokens expire after a [certain amount of time](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/reference/token-validity-periods/), depending on your certificate authority.

This means that, if your customers take too long to place their tokens at their authoritative DNS provider, you may need to [get new tokens](#1-get-txt-tokens) and re-share them with your customer.

---

### DigiCert

If you create a hostname with DigiCert as the certificate authority, you only need to share one TXT record for your customer to place at their authoritative DNS provider.

However, Cloudflare [will soon be deprecating](/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/) DigiCert as an issuing CA for custom hostnames, so we recommend you follow our [migration guide](/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/custom-hostname-certificates/) to move your custom hostnames over to another CA.
