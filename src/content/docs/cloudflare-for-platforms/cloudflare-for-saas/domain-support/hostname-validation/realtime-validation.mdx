When you use a real-time validation method, Cloudflare verifies your customer's hostname when your customers adds their [DNS routing record](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#3-have-customer-create-cname-record) to their authoritative DNS.

## Use when

Real-time validation methods put less burden on your customers because it does not require any additional actions.

However, it may cause some downtime since Cloudflare takes a few seconds to iterate over DNS records. This downtime also can increase - due to the increasing [validation backoff schedule](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/backoff-schedule/) - if your customer takes additional time to add their DNS routing record.

To minimize this downtime, you can continually send no-change [`PATCH` requests](/api/operations/custom-hostname-for-a-zone-edit-custom-hostname) for the specific custom hostname until it validates (which resets the validation backoff schedule).

To avoid any chance of downtime, use a [pre-validation method](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/pre-validation/)

## How to

Real-time validation occurs automatically when your customer adds their [DNS routing record](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#3-have-customer-create-cname-record).

The exact record depends on your Cloudflare for SaaS setup.
