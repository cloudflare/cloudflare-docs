Cloudflare for SaaS allows you, as a SaaS provider, to extend the benefits of Cloudflare products to custom domains by adding them to your zone as custom hostnames. We support adding hostnames that are a subdomain of your zone (for example, `sub.serviceprovider.com`) and vanity domains (for example, `customer.com`) to your SaaS zone.
