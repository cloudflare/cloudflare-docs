When you perform [TXT](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/txt/) domain control validation, you will need to share these tokens with your customers.

However, these tokens expire after a certain amount of time, depending on your chosen certificate authority.

| Certificate authority | Token validity |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Let's Encrypt         | 7 days         |
| Google Trust Services | 14 days        |
