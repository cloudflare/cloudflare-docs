---

To enable Cloudflare for SaaS for your account:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Custom Hostnames**.
4. Select **Enable**.
5. The next step depends on the zone's plan:
   * **Enterprise**: Can preview this product as a [non-contract service](/fundamentals/subscriptions-and-billing/preview-services/), which provide full access, free of metered usage fees, limits, and certain other restrictions.
   * **Non-enterprise**: Will have to enter payment information.

Different zone plan levels have access to different features. For more details, refer to [Plans](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/plans/).
