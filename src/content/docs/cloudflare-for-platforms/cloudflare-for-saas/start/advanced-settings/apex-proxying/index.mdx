Apex proxying allows your customers to use their apex domains (`example.com`) with your SaaS application.

## Benefits

In a normal Cloudflare for SaaS [setup](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/), your customers route traffic to your hostname by creating a `CNAME` record pointing to your CNAME target.

However, most DNS providers do not allow `CNAME` records at the zone's root[^1]. This means that your customers have to use a subdomain as a vanity domain (`shop.example.com`) instead of their domain apex (`example.com`).

This limitation does not apply with apex proxying. Cloudflare assigns a set of IP prefixes - cost associated, reach out to your account team - to your account (or uses your own if you have [BYOIP](/byoip/)). This means that customers can create a standard `A` record to route traffic to your domain, which can support the domain apex.

[^1]: Cloudflare offers this functionality through [CNAME flattening](/dns/cname-flattening/).
