Cloudflare partners with many [SaaS providers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/provider-guides/) to extend our performance and security benefits to your website.

Cloudflare customers can take this process a step further by managing their own zone on Cloudflare. This setup - known as **Orange-to-Orange (O2O)** - allows them to benefit from their provider's setup but still customize how Cloudflare treats incoming traffic to their zone.
