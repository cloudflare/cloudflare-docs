---

As a general rule, settings on the customer zone will override settings on the SaaS zone. In addition, [Orange-to-Orange](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/) does not permit traffic directed to a custom hostname zone into another custom hostname zone.

The following table provides a list of compatibility guidelines for various Cloudflare products and features.
