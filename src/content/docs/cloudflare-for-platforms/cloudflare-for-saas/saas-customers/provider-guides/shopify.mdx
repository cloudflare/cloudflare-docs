## Benefits

O2O routing also enables you to take advantage of Cloudflare zones specifically customized for Shopify traffic.

## How it works

For more details about how O2O is different than other Cloudflare setups, refer to [How O2O works](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).

## Enable

You can enable O2O on any Cloudflare zone plan.

To enable O2O on your account, [create](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) a `CNAME` DNS record.

| Type    | Name                 | Target                | Proxy status |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `CNAME` | `<YOUR_SHOP_DOMAIN>` | `shops.myshopify.com` | Proxied      |

:::note


For questions about Shopify setup, refer to their [support guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/domains/add-a-domain/connecting-domains/connect-domain-manual).

If you cannot activate your domain using [proxied DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/), reach out to your account team or the [Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com).

### DNS CAA records

Shopify issues SSL/TLS certificates for merchant domains using Let’s Encrypt. If you add any DNS CAA records, you must select Let’s Encrypt as the Certificate Authority (CA) or HTTPS connections may fail.

For more details, refer to [CAA records](/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/#caa-records-added-by-cloudflare).
