To get the value for a given key, call the `get()` method of the [KV binding](/kv/concepts/kv-bindings/) on any [KV namespace](/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/) you have bound to your Worker code:

```js
env.NAMESPACE.get(key);
```

The `get()` method returns a promise you can `await` on to get the value. If the key is not found, the promise will resolve with the literal value `null`.

#### Example

An example of reading a key from within a Worker:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		try {
			const value = await env.NAMESPACE.get("first-key");

			if (value === null) {
				return new Response("Value not found", { status: 404 });
			}
			return new Response(value);
		} catch (e) {
			return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

## Reference

The following methods are provided to read from KV:

- [get()](#get-method)
- [getWithMetadata()](#getwithmetadata-method)

### `get()` method

To get the value for a given key, call the `get()` method on any KV namespace you have bound to your Worker code:

```js
env.NAMESPACE.get(key, type?, options?);
```

The `get()` method returns a promise you can `await` on to get the value. If the key is not found, the promise will resolve with the literal value `null`.

#### Parameters

- `key`: `string`
  - The key of the KV pair.
- `type`: `"text" | "json" | "arrayBuffer" | "stream"`
  - Optional. The type of the value to be returned. `text` is the default.
- `options`: `{
    cacheTtl: number,
    type: "text" | "json" | "arrayBuffer" | "stream"
}`
  - Optional. Object containing the `cacheTtl` and `type` properties. The `cacheTtl` property defines the length of time in seconds that a KV result is cached in the global network location it is accessed from (minimum: 60). The `type` property defines the type of the value to be returned.

#### Response

- `response`: `Promise<string | Object | ArrayBuffer | ReadableStream | null>`
  - The value for the requested KV pair. The response type will depend on the `type` parameter provided for the `get()` command as follows:
    - `text`: A `string` (default).
    - `json`: An object decoded from a JSON string.
    - `arrayBuffer`: An [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) instance.
    - `stream`: A [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).

The `get()` method may return stale values. If a given key has recently been read in a given location, writes or updates to the key made in other locations may take up to 60 seconds (or the duration of the `cacheTtl`) to display.

### `getWithMetadata()` method

To get the value for a given key along with its metadata, call the `getWithMetadata()` method on any KV namespace you have bound to your Worker code:

```js
env.NAMESPACE.getWithMetadata(key, type?, options?);
```

Metadata is a serializable value you append to each KV entry.

#### Parameters

- `key`: `string`
  - The key of the KV pair.
- `type`: `"text" | "json" | "arrayBuffer" | "stream"`
  - Optional. The type of the value to be returned. `text` is the default.
- `options`: `{
    cacheTtl: number,
    type: "text" | "json" | "arrayBuffer" | "stream"
}`
  - Optional. Object containing the `cacheTtl` and `type` properties. The `cacheTtl` property defines the length of time in seconds that a KV result is cached in the global network location it is accessed from (minimum: 60). The `type` property defines the type of the value to be returned.

#### Response

- `response`: `Promise<{
value: string | Object | ArrayBuffer | ReadableStream | null,
metadata: string | null
}>`

  - An object containing the value and the metadata for the requested KV pair. The type of the value attribute will depend on the `type` parameter provided for the `getWithMetadata()` command as follows:
    - `text`: A `string` (default).
    - `json`: An object decoded from a JSON string.
    - `arrayBuffer`: An [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) instance.
    - `stream`: A [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).

If there is no metadata associated with the requested key-value pair, `null` will be returned for metadata.

The `getWithMetadata()` method may return stale values. If a given key has recently been read in a given location, writes or updates to the key made in other locations may take up to 60 seconds (or the duration of the `cacheTtl`) to display.

#### Example

An example of reading a key with metadata from within a Worker:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		try {
			const { value, metadata } =
				await env.NAMESPACE.getWithMetadata("first-key");

			if (value === null) {
				return new Response("Value not found", { status: 404 });
			}
			return new Response(value);
		} catch (e) {
			return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
};
```

## Guidance

### Type parameter

For simple values, use the default `text` type which provides you with your value as a `string`. For convenience, a `json` type is also specified which will convert a JSON value into an object before returning the object to you. For large values, use `stream` to request a `ReadableStream`. For binary values, use `arrayBuffer` to request an `ArrayBuffer`.

For large values, the choice of `type` can have a noticeable effect on latency and CPU usage. For reference, the `type` can be ordered from fastest to slowest as `stream`, `arrayBuffer`, `text`, and `json`.

### CacheTtl parameter

`cacheTtl` is a parameter that defines the length of time in seconds that a KV result is cached in the global network location it is accessed from.

Defining the length of time in seconds is useful for reducing cold read latency on keys that are read relatively infrequently. `cacheTtl` is useful if your data is write-once or write-rarely.

:::note[Hot and cold read]

A hot read means that the data is cached on Cloudflare's edge network using the [CDN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/), whether it is in a local cache or a regional cache. A cold read means that the data is not cached, so the data must be fetched from the central stores. Both existing key-value pairs and non-existent key-value pairs (also known as negative lookups) are cached at the edge.
:::

`cacheTtl` is not recommended if your data is updated often and you need to see updates shortly after they are written, because writes that happen from other global network locations will not be visible until the cached value expires.

The `cacheTtl` parameter must be an integer greater than or equal to `60`, which is the default.

The effective `cacheTtl` of an already cached item can be reduced by getting it again with a lower `cacheTtl`. For example, if you did `NAMESPACE.get(key, {cacheTtl: 86400})` but later realized that caching for 24 hours was too long, you could `NAMESPACE.get(key, {cacheTtl: 300})` or even `NAMESPACE.get(key)` and it would check for newer data to respect the provided `cacheTtl`, which defaults to 60 seconds.

## Other methods to access KV

You can [read key-value pairs from the command line with Wrangler](/kv/reference/kv-commands/#get) and [from the API](/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-read-key-value-pair).
