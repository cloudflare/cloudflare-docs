  order: 5

---

To create a new key-value pair, or to update the value for a particular key, call the `put()` method of the [KV binding](/kv/reference/kv-bindings/) on any [KV namespace](/kv/reference/kv-namespaces/) you have bound to your Worker code:

```js
env.NAMESPACE.put(key, value);
```

#### Example 

An example of writing a key-value pair from within a Worker:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    try {
      await env.NAMESPACE.put("first-key", "This is the value for the key");

      return new Response("Successful write", {
        status: 201
      });
    }
    catch (e)
    {
      return new Response(e.message, {status: 500});
    }
  },
};
```

## Reference

The following method is provided to write to KV:
- [put()](#put-method)

### `put()` method

To create a new key-value pair, or to update the value for a particular key, call the `put()` method on any KV namespace you have bound to your Worker code:

```js
env.NAMESPACE.put(key, value, options?);
```

#### Parameters

* `key`: `string`
  * The key to associate with the value. A key cannot be empty, have a `.` or `..`. All other keys are valid. Keys have a maximum length of 512 bytes.
* `value`: `string` | `ReadableStream` | `ArrayBuffer`
  * The value to store. The type is inferred. The maximum size of a value is 25 MiB.

* `options`: `{
  expiration?: number,
  expirationTtl?: number,
  metadata?: object
}`
  * Optional. An object containing the `expiration` (optional), `expirationTtl` (optional), and `metadata` (optional) attributes. 
    * `expiration` is the number that represents when to expire the key-value pair in seconds since epoch.
    * `expirationTtl` is the number that represents when to expire the key-value pair in seconds from now. The minimum value is 60.
    * `metadata` is an object that must serialize to JSON. The maximum size of the serialized JSON representation of the metadata object is 1024 bytes.

#### Response

* `response`: `Promise<void>`
  * A `Promise` that resolves if the update is successful.

The put() method returns a Promise that you should `await` on to verify a successful update.

## Guidance

### Concurrent writes to the same key

Due to the eventually consistent nature of KV, concurrent writes to the same key can end up overwriting one another. It is a common pattern to write data from a single process with Wrangler or the API. This avoids competing concurrent writes because of the single stream. All data is still readily available within all Workers bound to the namespace. 

If concurrent writes are made to the same key, the last write will take precedence. 

Writes are immediately visible to other requests in the same global network location, but can take up to 60 seconds (or the value of the `cacheTtl` parameter of the `get()` or `getWithMetadata()` methods) to be visible in other parts of the world. 

Refer to [How KV works](/kv/reference/how-kv-works/) for more information on this topic.

### Write data in bulk

Write more than one key-value pair at a time with Wrangler or [via the API](/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-write-multiple-key-value-pairs). 

The bulk API can accept up to 10,000 KV pairs at once.

A `key` and a `value` are required for each KV pair. The entire request size must be less than 100 megabytes. Bulk writes are not supported using the [KV binding](/kv/reference/kv-bindings/).

### Expiring keys

KV offers the ability to create keys that automatically expire. You may configure expiration to occur either at a particular point in time, or after a certain amount of time has passed since the key was last modified.

Once the expiration time of an expiring key is reached, it will be deleted from the system. After its deletion, attempts to read the key will behave as if the key does not exist. The deleted key will not count against the KV namespace’s storage usage for billing purposes.

:::note

An `expiration` setting on a key will result in that key being deleted, even in cases where the `cacheTtl` is set to a higher (longer duration) value. Expiration always takes precedence.  

:::

There are two ways to specify when a key should expire:

 - Set a key's expiration using an absolute time specified in a number of [seconds since the UNIX epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). For example, if you wanted a key to expire at 12:00AM UTC on April 1, 2019, you would set the key’s expiration to `1554076800`.

 - Set a key's expiration time to live (TTL) using a relative number of seconds from the current time. For example, if you wanted a key to expire 10 minutes after creating it, you would set its expiration TTL to `600`.

Expiration targets that are less than 60 seconds into the future are not supported. This is true for both expiration methods.

#### Create expiring keys
To create expiring keys, set `expiration` in the `put()` options to a number representing the seconds since epoch, or set `expirationTtl` in the `put()` options to a number representing the seconds from now:

```js
await env.NAMESPACE.put(key, value, {
  expiration: secondsSinceEpoch,
});

await env.NAMESPACE.put(key, value, {
  expirationTtl: secondsFromNow,
});
```

These assume that `secondsSinceEpoch` and `secondsFromNow` are variables defined elsewhere in your Worker code.

### Metadata

To associate metadata with a key-value pair, set `metadata` in the `put()` options to an object (serializable to JSON): 

```js
await env.NAMESPACE.put(key, value, {
  metadata: { someMetadataKey: "someMetadataValue" },
});
```

## Other methods to access KV

You can also [write key-value pairs from the command line with Wrangler](/kv/reference/kv-commands/#create) and [write data via the API](/api/operations/workers-kv-namespace-write-key-value-pair-with-metadata).
