Workers KV provides low-latency, high-throughput global storage to your [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/) applications. Workers KV is ideal for storing user configuration data, routing data, A/B testing configurations and authentication tokens, and is well suited for read-heavy workloads.

This guide instructs you through:

- Creating a KV namespace.
- Writing key-value pairs to your KV namespace from a Cloudflare Worker.
- Reading key-value pairs from a KV namespace.

## Prerequisites

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

## 1. Create a Worker project

:::note[New to Workers?]

Refer to [How Workers works](/workers/reference/how-workers-works/) to learn about the Workers serverless execution model works. Go to the [Workers Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/) to set up your first Worker.

:::

Create a new Worker to read and write to your KV namespace.

<Steps>
1. Create a new project named `kv-tutorial` by running:

	<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="cloudflare@latest" args={"kv-tutorial"} />

	<Render
		file="c3-post-run-steps"
		product="workers"
		params={{
			one: "Hello World example",
			two: "Hello World Worker",
			three: "TypeScript",
		}}
	/>

	This creates a new `kv-tutorial` directory, illustrated below.

	<FileTree>
		- kv-tutorial/
			- node_modules/
			- test/
			- src
				- **index.ts**
			- package-lock.json
			- package.json
			- testconfig.json
			- vitest.config.mts
			- worker-configuration.d.ts
			- **wrangler.toml**
		</FileTree>

	Your new `kv-tutorial` directory includes:

	- A `"Hello World"` [Worker](/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) in `index.ts`.
	- A [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file. `wrangler.toml` is how your `kv-tutorial` Worker accesses your kv database.

2. Change into the directory you just created for your Worker project:

	```sh
	cd kv-tutorial
	```
</Steps>

:::note

If you are familiar with Cloudflare Workers, or initializing projects in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, initialize a new project non-interactively by setting `CI=true` as an environmental variable when running `create cloudflare@latest`.

For example: `CI=true npm create cloudflare@latest kv-tutorial --type=simple --git --ts --deploy=false` creates a basic "Hello World" project ready to build on.

:::

## 2. Create a KV namespace

A [KV namespace](/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/) is a key-value database replicated to Cloudflareâ€™s global network.

You can create a KV namespace via Wrangler or the dashboard.

### Create a KV namespace via Wrangler

[Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) allows you to put, list, get, and delete entries within your KV namespace.

:::note

KV operations are scoped to your account.
:::

To create a KV namespace via Wrangler:

<Steps>
1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
	```

	The `npx wrangler kv namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE>` subcommand takes a new binding name as its argument. A KV namespace is created using a concatenation of your Workerâ€™s name (from your `wrangler.toml` file) and the binding name you provide. The `id` is randomly generated for you.

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE>
	```

	```sh output
	ðŸŒ€  Creating namespace with title <YOUR_WORKER-YOUR_NAMESPACE>
	âœ¨  Success!
	Add the following to your configuration file:
	kv_namespaces = [
		{ binding = <YOUR_BINDING>, id = "e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8" }
	]
	```

2. In your `wrangler.toml` file, add the following with the values generated in your terminal:

	```toml
	kv_namespaces = [
			{ binding = "<YOUR_BINDING>", id = "<YOUR_ID>" }
	]
	```

	Binding names do not need to correspond to the namespace you created. Binding names are only a reference. Specifically:

	- The value (string) you set for `<YOUR_BINDING>` is used to reference this database in your Worker. In this tutorial, name your binding `DB`.
	- The binding must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "MY_KV"` or `binding = "routingConfig"` would both be valid names for the binding.
	- Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<YOUR_BINDING>` from within your Worker.
</Steps>

:::note[Bindings]

A binding is how your Worker interacts with external resources such as [KV namespaces](/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/). A binding is a runtime variable that the Workers runtime provides to your code. You can declare a variable name in your `wrangler.toml` file that binds to these resources at runtime, and interact with them through this variable. Every binding's variable name and behavior is determined by you when deploying the Worker.

Refer to [Environment](/kv/reference/environments/) for more information.

:::

### Create a KV namespace via the dashboard

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select **Workers & Pages** > **KV**.
3. Select **Create a namespace**.
4. Enter a name for your namespace.
5. Select **Add**.
</Steps>

:::note

KV namespaces prior to version 7 cannot be edited via the Cloudflare dashboard. To edit KV namespaces, use the [KV API](/kv/api/).
:::

## 3. Interact with your KV namespace with Wrangler

You can interact with your KV namespace via [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) or directly from your [Workers](/workers/) application.

### Write a value via Wrangler

To write a value to your empty KV namespace using Wrangler:

<Steps>
1. Run the `wrangler kv key put` subcommand in your terminal, and input your key and value respectively. `<KEY>` and `<VALUE>` are values of your choice.

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv key put --binding=<YOUR_BINDING> "<KEY>" "<VALUE>"
	```

	```sh output
	Writing the value "<VALUE>" to key "<KEY>" on namespace e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8.
	```
</Steps>

Instead of using `--binding`, you can also use `--namespace-id` to specify which KV namespace should receive the operation:

```sh
npx wrangler kv key put --namespace-id=e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8 "<KEY>" "<VALUE>"
```

```sh output
Writing the value "<VALUE>" to key "<KEY>" on namespace e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8.
```

To create a key and a value in local mode, add the `--local` flag at the end of the command:

```sh
npx wrangler kv key put --namespace-id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "<KEY>" "<VALUE>" --local
```

### Get a value via Wrangler

To access the value using Wrangler:

<Steps>
1. Run the `wrangler kv key get` subcommand in your terminal, and input your key value:

	```sh
	# Replace [OPTIONS] with --binding or --namespace-id
	npx wrangler kv key get [OPTIONS] "<KEY>"
	```

	A KV namespace can be specified in two ways:

	<Details header="With a `--binding`">

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv key get --binding=<YOUR_BINDING> "<KEY>"
	```

	</Details>

	<Details header ="With a `--namespace-id`">

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv key get --namespace-id=<YOUR_ID> "<KEY>"
	```
	</Details>
</Steps>

You can add a `--preview` flag to interact with a preview namespace instead of a production namespace.

:::caution

Exactly **one** of `--binding` or `--namespace-id` is required.
:::

:::note
To view the value directly within the terminal, add `--text`
:::

Refer to the [`kv bulk` documentation](/kv/reference/kv-commands/#kv-bulk) to write a file of multiple key-value pairs to a given KV namespace.

## 4. Access your KV namespace from a Worker

You can access the binding from within your Worker.

:::note

When using [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) to develop locally, Wrangler defaults to using a local version of KV to avoid interfering with any of your live production data in KV. This means that reading keys that you have not written locally returns null.

To have `wrangler dev` connect to your Workers KV namespace running on Cloudflare's global network, call `wrangler dev --remote` instead. This uses the `preview_id` of the KV binding configuration in the `wrangler.toml` file. See the [KV binding docs](/kv/concepts/kv-bindings/#using-the-kv-binding-when-developing-locally) for more information.

:::

<Steps>
1. In your Worker script, add your KV namespace in the `Env` interface:

	```ts
	interface Env {
		YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
		// ... other binding types
	}
	```

2. Use the `put()` method on `YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE` to create a new key-value pair, or to update the value for a particular key:

	```ts
	let value = await env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.put(key, value);
	```

3. Use the KV `get()` method to fetch the data you stored in your KV database:

	```ts
	let value = await env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.get("KEY");
	```
</Steps>

Your Worker code should look like this:

```ts
export interface Env {
	YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		try {
			await env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.put("KEY", "VALUE");
			const value = await env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.get("KEY");
			if (value === null) {
				return new Response("Value not found", { status: 404 });
			}
			return new Response(value);
		} catch (err) {
			// In a production application, you could instead choose to retry your KV
			// read or fall back to a default code path.
			console.error(`KV returned error: ${err}`);
			return new Response(err, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

The code above:

1. Writes a key to `YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE` using KV's `put()` method.
2. Reads the same key using KV's `get()` method, and returns an error if the key is null (or in case the key is not set, or does not exist).
3. Uses JavaScript's [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) exception handling to catch potential errors. When writing or reading from any service, such as Workers KV or external APIs using `fetch()`, you should expect to handle exceptions explicitly.

To run your project locally, enter the following command within your project directory:

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

When you run `wrangler dev`, Wrangler provides a URL (usually a `localhost:8787`) to review your Worker. The browser prints your value when you visit the URL provided by Wrangler.

## 5. Deploy your KV

<Steps>
1. Run the following command to deploy KV to Cloudflare's global network:

	```sh
	npx wrangler deploy
	```

2. Visit the URL for your newly created Workers KV application.

	For example, if the URL of your new Worker is `kv-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, accessing `https://kv-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/` sends a request to your Worker that writes (and reads) from Workers KV.
</Steps>

## Summary

By finishing this tutorial, you have:

1. Created a KV namespace
2. Created a Worker that writes and reads from that namespace
3. Deployed your project globally.
