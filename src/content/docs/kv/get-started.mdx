Workers KV provides low-latency, high-throughput global storage to your [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/) applications. Workers KV is ideal for storing user configuration data, routing data, A/B testing configurations and authentication tokens, and is well suited for read-heavy workloads.

This guide instructs you through:

- Creating a KV namespace.
- Writing key-value pairs to your KV namespace from a Cloudflare Worker.
- Reading key-value pairs from a KV namespace.

You can perform these tasks through the CLI or through the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Prerequisites

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

## 1. Create a Worker project

:::note[New to Workers?]

Refer to [How Workers works](/workers/reference/how-workers-works/) to learn about the Workers serverless execution model works. Go to the [Workers Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/) to set up your first Worker.

:::

<Tabs syncKey = 'CLIvsDash'> <TabItem label='CLI'>

Create a new Worker to read and write to your KV namespace.

<Steps>
1. Create a new project named `kv-tutorial` by running:

    <PackageManagers type="create" pkg="cloudflare@latest" args={"kv-tutorial"} />

    <Render
    	file="c3-post-run-steps"
    	product="workers"
    	params={{
    	category: "hello-world",
    	type: "Hello World Worker",
    	lang: "TypeScript",
    	}}
    />

    This creates a new `kv-tutorial` directory, illustrated below.

    <FileTree>
    	- kv-tutorial/
    		- node_modules/
    		- test/
    		- src
    			- **index.ts**
    		- package-lock.json
    		- package.json
    		- testconfig.json
    		- vitest.config.mts
    		- worker-configuration.d.ts
    		- **wrangler.toml**
    </FileTree>

    Your new `kv-tutorial` directory includes:

    - A `"Hello World"` [Worker](/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) in `index.ts`.
    - A [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file. `wrangler.toml` is how your `kv-tutorial` Worker accesses your kv database.

2. Change into the directory you just created for your Worker project:

	```sh
	cd kv-tutorial
	```

	:::note

	If you are familiar with Cloudflare Workers, or initializing projects in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, initialize a new project non-interactively by setting `CI=true` as an environmental variable when running `create cloudflare@latest`.

	For example: `CI=true npm create cloudflare@latest kv-tutorial --type=simple --git --ts --deploy=false` creates a basic "Hello World" project ready to build on.

	:::

<Steps>
1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
2. Go to [your account > **Workers & Pages** > **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages).
3. Select **Create**.
4. Select **Create Worker**.
5. Name your Worker. For this tutorial, name your Worker `kv-tutorial`.
6. Select **Deploy**.
</Steps>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Create a KV namespace

A [KV namespace](/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/) is a key-value database replicated to Cloudflareâ€™s global network.

<Tabs syncKey = 'CLIvsDash'> <TabItem label='CLI'>

[Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) allows you to put, list, get, and delete entries within your KV namespace.

:::note

KV operations are scoped to your account.
:::

To create a KV namespace via Wrangler:

<Steps>
1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv namespace create <BINDING_NAME>
	```

	The `npx wrangler kv namespace create <BINDING_NAME>` subcommand takes a new binding name as its argument. A KV namespace is created using a concatenation of your Workerâ€™s name (from your `wrangler.toml` file) and the binding name you provide. A `BINDING_ID` is randomly generated for you.

	For this tutorial, use the binding name `BINDING_NAME`.

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv namespace create kv_binding_name
	```

	```sh output
	ðŸŒ€  Creating namespace with title kv-tutorial-kv_binding_name
	âœ¨  Success!
	Add the following to your configuration file:
	[[kv_namespaces]]
	binding = "BINDING_NAME"
	id = "<BINDING_ID>"
	```

</Steps>

</TabItem><TabItem label = 'Dashboard'>

<Steps>
1. Go to [**Storage & Databases** > **KV**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces).



2. Select **Create a namespace**.
3. Enter a name for your namespace. For this tutorial, use `kv_tutorial_namespace`.
4. Select **Add**.
</Steps>

:::note

</TabItem></Tabs>

## 3. Bind your Worker to your KV namespace

You must create a binding to connect your Worker with your KV namespace. [Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to access resources, like KV, on the Cloudflare developer platform.

To bind your KV namespace to your Worker:

<Tabs syncKey='CLIvsDash'><TabItem label='CLI'>
<Steps>
1. In your `wrangler.toml` file, add the following with the values generated in your terminal from [step 2](/kv/get-started/#2-create-a-kv-namespace):

	```toml
	[[kv_namespaces]] =
	binding = "<BINDING_NAME>"
	id = "<BINDING_ID>"

	```

   Binding names do not need to correspond to the namespace you created. Binding names are only a reference. Specifically:

	- The value (string) you set for `<BINDING_NAME>` is used to reference this KV namespace in your Worker. For this tutorial, this should be `BINDING_NAME`.
	- The binding must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "MY_KV"` or `binding = "routingConfig"` would both be valid names for the binding.
	- Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<BINDING_NAME>` from within your Worker.
</Steps>

:::note[Bindings]

A binding is how your Worker interacts with external resources such as [KV namespaces](/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/). A binding is a runtime variable that the Workers runtime provides to your code. You can declare a variable name in your `wrangler.toml` file that binds to these resources at runtime, and interact with them through this variable. Every binding's variable name and behavior is determined by you when deploying the Worker.

Refer to [Environment](/kv/reference/environments/) for more information.

:::

</TabItem><TabItem label='Dashboard'>

<Steps>
1. Go to [**Workers & Pages** > **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages).
2. Select the `kv-tutorial` Worker you created in [step 1](/kv/get-started/#1-create-a-worker-project).
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Scroll to **Bindings**, then select **Add**.
5. Select **KV namespace**.
6. Name your binding (`kv_binding_name`) in **Variable name**, then select the KV namespace (`kv_tutorial_namespace`) you created in [step 2](/kv/get-started/#2-create-a-kv-namespace) from the dropdown menu.
7. Select **Deploy** to deploy your binding. 
</Steps>
</TabItem></Tabs>

## 4. Interact with your KV namespace

You can interact with your KV namespace via [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) or directly from your [Workers](/workers/) application.

### Write a value

<Tabs syncKey='CLIvsDash'><TabItem label = 'CLI'>

To write a value to your empty KV namespace using Wrangler:

<Steps>
1. Run the `wrangler kv key put` subcommand in your terminal, and input your key and value respectively. `<KEY>` and `<VALUE>` are values of your choice.

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv key put --binding=<BINDING_NAME> "<KEY>" "<VALUE>"
	```

	```sh output
	Writing the value "<VALUE>" to key "<KEY>" on namespace <BINDING_ID>.
	```
</Steps>

Instead of using `--binding`, you can also use `--namespace-id` to specify which KV namespace should receive the operation:

```sh
npx wrangler kv key put --namespace-id=<BINDING_ID> "<KEY>" "<VALUE>"
```

```sh output
Writing the value "<VALUE>" to key "<KEY>" on namespace <BINDING_ID>.
```

To create a key and a value in local mode, add the `--local` flag at the end of the command:

```sh
npx wrangler kv key put --namespace-id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "<KEY>" "<VALUE>" --local
```

</TabItem><TabItem label = 'Dashboard'>
<Steps>
1. Go to [**Storage & Databases** > **KV**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/kv/namespaces).
2. Select the KV namespace you created (`kv_tutorial_namespace`), then select **View**.
3. Select **KV Pairs**.
4. Enter a `<KEY>` of your choice.
5. Enter a `<VALUE>` of your choice.
6. Select **Add entry**.
</Steps>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Get a value

<Tabs syncKey='CLIvsDash'><TabItem label = 'CLI'>

To access the value using Wrangler:

<Steps>
1. Run the `wrangler kv key get` subcommand in your terminal, and input your key value:

    ```sh
    # Replace [OPTIONS] with --binding or --namespace-id
    npx wrangler kv key get [OPTIONS] "<KEY>"
    ```

    A KV namespace can be specified in two ways:

    <Details header="With a `--binding`">

	```sh
	npx wrangler kv key get --binding=<BINDING_NAME> "<KEY>"
	```

    </Details>

    <Details header ="With a `--namespace-id`">

    ```sh
    npx wrangler kv key get --namespace-id=<YOUR_ID> "<KEY>"
    ```
    </Details>

</Steps>

You can add a `--preview` flag to interact with a preview namespace instead of a production namespace.

:::caution

Exactly **one** of `--binding` or `--namespace-id` is required.
:::

:::note
To view the value directly within the terminal, add `--text`
:::

Refer to the [`kv bulk` documentation](/kv/reference/kv-commands/#kv-bulk) to write a file of multiple key-value pairs to a given KV namespace.

</TabItem><TabItem label='Dashboard'>

You can view key-value pairs directly from the dashboard.
<Steps>
1. Go to your account > **Storage & Databases** > **KV**.
2. Go to the KV namespace you created (`kv_tutorial_namespace`), then select **View**.
3. Select **KV Pairs**.
</Steps>
</TabItem></Tabs>

## 5. Access your KV namespace from your Worker

<Tabs syncKey = 'CLIvsDash'><TabItem label = 'CLI'>

:::note

When using [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) to develop locally, Wrangler defaults to using a local version of KV to avoid interfering with any of your live production data in KV. This means that reading keys that you have not written locally returns null.

To have `wrangler dev` connect to your Workers KV namespace running on Cloudflare's global network, call `wrangler dev --remote` instead. This uses the `preview_id` of the KV binding configuration in the `wrangler.toml` file. See the [KV binding docs](/kv/concepts/kv-bindings/#using-the-kv-binding-when-developing-locally) for more information.

:::

<Steps>
1. In your Worker script, add your KV binding in the `Env` interface:

	```ts
	interface Env {
		BINDING_NAME: KVNamespace;
		// ... other binding types
	}
	```

2. Use the `put()` method on `BINDING_NAME` to create a new key-value pair, or to update the value for a particular key:

	```ts
	let value = await env.BINDING_NAME.put(key, value);
	```

3. Use the KV `get()` method to fetch the data you stored in your KV database:

	```ts
	let value = await env.BINDING_NAME.get("KEY");
	```
</Steps>

Your Worker code should look like this:

```ts
export interface Env {
	BINDING_NAME: KVNamespace;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		try {
			await env.BINDING_NAME.put("KEY", "VALUE");
			const value = await env.BINDING_NAME.get("KEY");
			if (value === null) {
				return new Response("Value not found", { status: 404 });
			}
			return new Response(value);
		} catch (err) {
			// In a production application, you could instead choose to retry your KV
			// read or fall back to a default code path.
			console.error(`KV returned error: ${err}`);
			return new Response(err, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

The code above:

1. Writes a key to `BINDING_NAME` using KV's `put()` method.
2. Reads the same key using KV's `get()` method, and returns an error if the key is null (or in case the key is not set, or does not exist).
3. Uses JavaScript's [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) exception handling to catch potential errors. When writing or reading from any service, such as Workers KV or external APIs using `fetch()`, you should expect to handle exceptions explicitly.

To run your project locally, enter the following command within your project directory:

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

When you run `wrangler dev`, Wrangler provides a URL (usually a `localhost:8787`) to review your Worker. The browser prints your value when you visit the URL provided by Wrangler.

The browser should simply return the `VALUE` corresponding to the `KEY` you have specified with the `get()` method.

</TabItem><TabItem label = 'Dashboard'>

<Steps>
1. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Overview**.
2. Go to the `kv-tutorial` Worker you created.
3. Select **Edit Code**.
4. Clear the contents of the `workers.js` file, then paste the following code. Replace the `BINDING_NAME` with your binding name.

	```js
	export default {
		async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
			try {
				await env.BINDING_NAME.put("KEY", "VALUE");
				const value = await env.BINDING_NAME.get("KEY");
				if (value === null) {
					return new Response("Value not found", { status: 404 });
				}
				return new Response(value);
			} catch (err) {
				// In a production application, you could instead choose to retry your KV
				// read or fall back to a default code path.
				console.error(`KV returned error: ${err}`);
				return new Response(err.toString(), { status: 500 });
			}
		},
	};
	```

	For this tutorial, your `BINDING_NAME` should be `kv_binding_name`.

	The code above:

	1. Writes a key to `BINDING_NAME` using KV's `put()` method.
	2. Reads the same key using KV's `get()` method, and returns an error if the key is null (or in case the key is not set, or does not exist).
	3. Uses JavaScript's [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) exception handling to catch potential errors. When writing or reading from any service, such as Workers KV or external APIs using `fetch()`, you should expect to handle exceptions explicitly.

	The browser should simply return the `VALUE` corresponding to the `KEY` you have specified with the `get()` method.
2. Select **Save**.

## 6. Deploy your KV

<Tabs syncKey = 'CLIvsDash'><TabItem label = 'CLI'>

<Steps>
1. Run the following command to deploy KV to Cloudflare's global network:

    ```sh
    npx wrangler deploy
    ```

2. Visit the URL for your newly created Workers KV application.

   For example, if the URL of your new Worker is `kv-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, accessing `https://kv-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/` sends a request to your Worker that writes (and reads) from Workers KV.

</Steps>

</TabItem><TabItem label='Dashboard'>
<Steps>

1. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Overview**.
2. Select your `kv-tutorial` Worker.
3. Select **Deployments**.
4. From the **Version History** table, select **Deploy version**.
5. From the **Deploy version** page, select **Deploy**.

	This deploys the latest version of the Worker code to production.

</Steps>
</TabItem></Tabs>
