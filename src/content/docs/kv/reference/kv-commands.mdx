## Deprecations

Below are deprecations to Wrangler commands for Workers KV.

### `kv:...` syntax deprecation

Since version 3.60.0, Wrangler supports the `kv ...` syntax. If you are using versions below 3.60.0, the command follows the `kv:...` syntax.

The `kv:...` syntax is deprecated in versions 3.60.0 and beyond and will be removed in a future major version.

For example, commands using the `kv ...` syntax look as such:

```sh
wrangler kv namespace list
wrangler kv key get <KEY>
wrangler kv bulk put <FILENAME>
```

The same commands using the `kv:...` syntax look as such:

```sh
wrangler kv:namespace list
wrangler kv:key get <KEY>
wrangler kv:bulk put <FILENAME>
```
