Once you [create a gateway](/web3/how-to/manage-gateways/#create-a-gateway), it can have one of several statuses.

| Status       | Definition                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**   | The DNS records for your gateway have been created and are functioning correctly.                                                                          |
| **Pending**  | Your Web3 gateway is in the process of becoming **Active**.                                                                                                |
| **Deleting** | Your Web3 gateway is being deleted.                                                                                                                        |
| **Error**    | The DNS records for your gateway are misconfigured or do not exist. To fix, try [refreshing the gateway](/web3/how-to/manage-gateways/#refresh-a-gateway). |
