[Roughtime](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime) is a simple, flexible, and secure authenticated time protocol developed by Google.

## Background

Endpoints on the Internet often synchronize their clocks using the [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](/time-services/ntp/). NTP provides precise synchronization, but is frequently deployed without a means of authentication. This is due to a [combination of issues](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/dowling).

As a result, a man-in-the-middle attacker can easily influence a victim’s clock. By moving them back in time, the attacker can, for example, force a victim to accept an expired (and possibly compromised) TLS certificate or session ticket.

For many applications, *precise* network time is not essential. It is sufficient to have *accurate* time to mitigate these kinds of attacks, such as within 10 seconds of real time. This observation is the primary motivation behind Roughtime.
