    content: Get the Roughtime from Cloudflare
---

The "Hello, world!" of Roughtime is very simple: the client sends a request over UDP to the server and the server responds with a signed timestamp.

You just need the server's address and public key to run the protocol:

- **Server address**: `roughtime.cloudflare.com:2003` (resolves to an IP address in our [anycast IP range](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/)). You can use either IPv4 or IPv6.
- **Public key**: `0GD7c3yP8xEc4Zl2zeuN2SlLvDVVocjsPSL8/Rl/7zg=`

To get started, download and run Cloudflare's [Go client](https://github.com/cloudflare/roughtime):

```go
go install github.com/cloudflare/roughtime/cmd/getroughtime@latest
getroughtime -ping roughtime.cloudflare.com:2003 -pubkey 0GD7c3yP8xEc4Zl2zeuN2SlLvDVVocjsPSL8/Rl/7zg=
```

## Beta notice

Cloudflare Roughtime is currently in beta. As such, our root public key may
change in the future. We will keep this page up-to-date with the most current public key.

You can also obtain it programmatically using DNS. For example:

```sh
dig TXT roughtime.cloudflare.com | grep -oP 'TXT\s"\K.*?(?=")'
```

## Next steps

Beyond just getting the Roughtime from Cloudflare, you may want to use it to [keep your clock in sync](/time-services/roughtime/recipes/).
