Terraform ships as a single binary file. The examples below include installation information for popular operating systems.

For official instructions on installing Terraform, refer to [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-associate-tutorials/install-cli).

:::caution


Terraform maintains your configuration state, which can be broken when you make configuration changes through both Terraform and either the Cloudflare Dashboard or API.

To avoid this state, make sure you manage Terraform resources only in Terraform. For more details, refer to our [best practices](/terraform/advanced-topics/best-practices/).

## Mac

The easiest way to install Terraform on macOS is with Homebrew.

```sh
$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

You can install the `terraform` binary via your distribution's package manager. For example:

```sh
$ sudo apt install terraform

Alternatively, you can fetch a specific version directly and place the binary in your `PATH`:

```sh
$ wget -q https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.4.5/terraform_1.4.5_linux_amd64.zip

$ unzip terraform_1.4.5_linux_amd64.zip
Archive:  terraform_1.4.5_linux_amd64.zip
  inflating: terraform

$ sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform

$ terraform version
Terraform v1.4.5
```

## Windows

1. Download the 32 or 64-bit executable from the [Download Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) page.
