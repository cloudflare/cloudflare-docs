Cloudflare offers [Custom Domain Protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/custom-domain-protection/) to customers with a Cloudflare Enterprise plan and high-profile domains who need the highest level of security against domain hijacking.

Custom Domain Protection offers additional safeguard features for registered domains, including:

* **Registry lock**: Cloudflare applies Registry Lock, when available, to all domains registered through Custom Domain Protection. Any changes to a domain requires Cloudflare to first unlock the domain at the registry level.
* **Out-of-band authentication**: All changes to domain ownership or nameserver information are verified and executed manually based on an authentication process defined by the customer.
* **No interface**: Custom Domain Protection does not offer an interface, to remove the possibility of domain hijack through a compromised account.

Contact your account team if you are interested in Cloudflare's Custom Domain Protection.
