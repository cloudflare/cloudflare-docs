title: Preview Local Projects with Cloudflare Tunnel
---

[Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) runs a lightweight daemon (`cloudflared`) in your infrastructure that establishes outbound connections (Tunnels) between your origin web server and the Cloudflare global network. In practical terms, you can use Cloudflare Tunnel to allow remote access to services running on your local machine. It is an alternative to popular tools like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com), and provides free, long-running tunnels via the [TryCloudflare](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) service.

While Cloudflare Pages provides unique [deploy preview URLs](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) for new branches and commits on your projects, Cloudflare Tunnel can be used to provide access to locally running applications and servers during the development process. In this guide, you will install Cloudflare Tunnel, and create a new tunnel to provide access to a locally running application. You will need a Cloudflare account to begin using Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Installing Cloudflare Tunnel

Cloudflare Tunnel can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. To learn about installing Cloudflare Tunnel, refer to the [Install cloudflared](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) page in the Cloudflare for Teams documentation.

Confirm that `cloudflared` is installed correctly by running `cloudflared --version` in your command line:

```sh
cloudflared --version
```

```sh output
cloudflared version 2021.5.9 (built 2021-05-21-1541 UTC)
```

## Run a local service

The easiest way to get up and running with Cloudflare Tunnel is to have an application running locally, such as a [React](/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) or [Svelte](/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-svelte-site/) site. When you are developing an application with these frameworks, they will often make use of a `npm run develop` script, or something similar, which mounts the application and runs it on a `localhost` port. For example, the popular `vite` tool runs your in-development React application on port `5173`, making it accessible at the `http://localhost:5173` address.

## Start a Cloudflare Tunnel

With a local development server running, a new Cloudflare Tunnel can be instantiated by running `cloudflared tunnel` in a new command line window, passing in the `--url` flag with your `localhost` URL and port. `cloudflared` will output logs to your command line, including a banner with a tunnel URL:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

```sh output

```

In this example, the randomly-generated URL `https://seasonal-deck-organisms-sf.trycloudflare.com` has been created and assigned to your tunnel instance. Visiting this URL in a browser will show the application running, with requests being securely forwarded through Cloudflare's global network, through the tunnel running on your machine, to `localhost:5173`:

## Next Steps

Cloudflare Tunnel can be configured in a variety of ways and can be used beyond providing access to your in-development applications. For example, you can provide `cloudflared` with a [configuration file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/local-management/configuration-file/) to add more complex routing and tunnel setups that go beyond a simple `--url` flag. You can also [attach a Cloudflare DNS record](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/routing-to-tunnel/dns/) to a domain or subdomain for an easily accessible, long-lived tunnel to your local machine.

Finally, by incorporating Cloudflare Access, you can provide [secure access to your tunnels](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) without exposing your entire server, or compromising on security. Refer to the [Cloudflare for Teams documentation](/cloudflare-one/) to learn more about what you can do with Cloudflare's entire suite of Zero Trust tools.
