title: Set build commands per branch

---

This guide will instruct you how to set build commands on specific branches. You will use the `CF_PAGES_BRANCH` environment variable to run a script on a specified branch as opposed to your Production branch. This guide assumes that you have a Cloudflare account and a Pages project.

## Set up

Create a `.sh` file in your project directory. You can choose your file's name, but we recommend you name the file `build.sh`.

In the following script, you will use the `CF_PAGES_BRANCH` environment variable to check which branch is currently being built. Populate your `.sh` file with the following:

```bash
# !/bin/bash

if [ "$CF_PAGES_BRANCH" == "production" ]; then
  # Run the "production" script in `package.json` on the "production" branch
  # "production" should be replaced with the name of your Production branch

  npm run production

elif [ "$CF_PAGES_BRANCH" == "staging" ]; then
  # Run the "staging" script in `package.json` on the "staging" branch
  # "staging" should be replaced with the name of your specific branch

  npm run staging

else
  # Else run the dev script
  npm run dev
fi
```

## Publish your changes

To put your changes into effect:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers & Pages** > in **Overview**, select your Pages project.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Build & deployments** > **Build configurations** > **Edit configurations**.
4. Update the **Build command** field value to `bash build.sh` and select **Save**.

To test that your build is successful, deploy your project.
