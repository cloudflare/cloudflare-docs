title: Build an API for your front end using Pages Functions
languages:
  - JavaScript
---

In this tutorial, you will build a full-stack Pages application. Your application will contain:

- A front end, built using Cloudflare Pages and the [React framework](/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/).
- A JSON API, built with [Pages Functions](/pages/functions/get-started/), that returns blog posts that can be retrieved and rendered in your front end.

If you prefer to work with a headless CMS rather than an API to render your blog content, refer to the [headless CMS tutorial](/pages/tutorials/build-a-blog-using-nuxt-and-sanity/).

## Build your front end

To begin, create a new Pages application using the React framework.

### Create a new React project

In your terminal, create a new React project called `blog-frontend` using the `create-react-app` command. Go into the newly created `blog-frontend` directory and start a local development server:

```sh title="Create a new React application"
npx create-react-app blog-frontend
cd blog-frontend
npm start
```

### Set up your React project

To set up your React project:

1. Install the [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) in the root of your `blog-frontend` directory.

With `npm`:

```sh
npm install react-router-dom@6
```

With `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-router-dom@6
```

2. Clear the contents of `src/App.js`. Copy and paste the following code to import the React Router into `App.js`, and set up a new router with two routes:

```js
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

import Posts from "./components/posts";
import Post from "./components/post";

function App() {
	return (
		<Routes>
			<Route path="/" element={<Posts />} />
			<Route path="/posts/:id" element={<Post />} />
		</Routes>
	);
}

export default App;
```

3. In the `src` directory, create a new folder called `components`.
4. In the `components` directory, create two files: `posts.js`, and `post.js`. These files will load the blog posts from your API, and render them.
5. Populate `posts.js` with the following code:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Posts = () => {
	const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

	useEffect(() => {
		const getPosts = async () => {
			const resp = await fetch("/api/posts");
			const postsResp = await resp.json();
			setPosts(postsResp);
		};

		getPosts();
	}, []);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Posts</h1>
			{posts.map((post) => (
				<div key={post.id}>
					<h2>
						<Link to={`/posts/${post.id}`}>{post.title}</Link>
					</h2>
				</div>
			))}
		</div>
	);
};

export default Posts;
```

6. Populate `post.js` with the following code:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Link, useParams } from "react-router-dom";

const Post = () => {
	const [post, setPost] = useState({});
	const { id } = useParams();

	useEffect(() => {
		const getPost = async () => {
			const resp = await fetch(`/api/post/${id}`);
			const postResp = await resp.json();
			setPost(postResp);
		};

		getPost();
	}, [id]);

	if (!Object.keys(post).length) return <div />;

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>{post.title}</h1>
			<p>{post.text}</p>
			<p>
				<em>Published {new Date(post.published_at).toLocaleString()}</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<Link to="/">Go back</Link>
			</p>
		</div>
	);
};

export default Post;
```

## Build your API

You will now create a Pages Functions that stores your blog content and retrieves it via a JSON API.

### Write your Pages Function

To create the Pages Function that will act as your JSON API:

1. Create a `functions` directory in your `blog-frontend` directory.
2. In `functions`, create a directory named `api`.
3. In `api`, create a `posts.js` file in the `api` directory.
4. Populate `posts.js` with the following code:

```js
import posts from "./post/data";

export function onRequestGet() {
	return Response.json(posts);
}
```

This code gets blog data (from `data.js`, which you will make in step 8) and returns it as a JSON response from the path `/api/posts`.

5. In the `api` directory, create a directory named `post`.
6. In the `post` directory, create a `data.js` file.
7. Populate `data.js` with the following code. This is where your blog content, blog title, and other information about your blog lives.

```js
const posts = [
	{
		id: 1,
		title: "My first blog post",
		text: "Hello world! This is my first blog post on my new Cloudflare Workers + Pages blog.",
		published_at: new Date("2020-10-23"),
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		title: "Updating my blog",
		text: "It's my second blog post! I'm still writing and publishing using Cloudflare Workers + Pages :)",
		published_at: new Date("2020-10-26"),
	},
];

export default posts;
```

8. In the `post` directory, create an `[[id]].js` file.
9. Populate `[[id]].js` with the following code:

```js title="[[id]].js"
import posts from "./data";

export function onRequestGet(context) {
	const id = context.params.id;

	if (!id) {
		return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
	}

	const post = posts.find((post) => post.id === Number(id));

	if (!post) {
		return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
	}

	return Response.json(post);
}
```

`[[id]].js` is a [dynamic route](/pages/functions/routing#dynamic-routes) which is used to accept a blog post `id`.

## Deploy

After you have configured your Pages application and Pages Function, deploy your project using the Wrangler or via the dashboard.

### Deploy with Wrangler

In your `blog-frontend` directory, run [`wrangler pages deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy-1) to deploy your project to the Cloudflare dashboard.

```sh
wrangler pages deploy blog-frontend
```

### Deploy via the dashboard

To deploy via the Cloudflare dashboard, you will need to create a new Git repository for your Pages project and connect your Git repository to Cloudflare. This tutorial uses GitHub as its Git provider.

#### Create a new repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

Deploy your application to Pages:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers & Pages** > **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
3. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

<div>

| Configuration option | Value           |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Production branch    | `main`          |
| Build command        | `npm run build` |
| Build directory      | `build`         |

</div>

After configuring your site, begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `blog-frontend`, your project dependencies, and building your site.

By completing this tutorial, you have created a full-stack Pages application.
