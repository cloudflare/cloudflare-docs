Here are some known bugs and issues with Cloudflare Pages:

## Builds and deployment

- GitHub and GitLab are currently the only supported platforms for automatic CI/CD builds. [Direct Upload](/pages/get-started/direct-upload/) allows you to integrate your own build platform or upload from your local computer.

- Incremental builds are currently not supported in Cloudflare Pages.

- Uploading a `/functions` directory through the dashboard's Direct Upload option does not work (refer to [Using Functions in Direct Upload](/pages/get-started/direct-upload/#functions)).

- Commits/PRs from forked repositories will not create a preview. Support for this will come in the future.

## Git configuration

- After you have selected a GitHub/GitLab repository for your Pages application, it cannot be changed. Delete your Pages project and create a new one pointing at a different repository if you need to update it.

## Build configuration

- `*.pages.dev` subdomains currently cannot be changed. If you need to change your `*.pages.dev` subdomain, delete your project and create a new one.

- Hugo builds automatically run an old version. To run the latest version of Hugo (for example, `0.101.0`), you will need to set an environment variable. Set `HUGO_VERSION` to `0.101.0` or the Hugo version of your choice.

- By default, Cloudflare uses Node `12.18.0` in the Pages build environment. If you need to use a newer Node version, refer to the [Build configuration page](/pages/configuration/build-configuration/) for configuration options.

- For users migrating from Netlify, Cloudflare does not support Netlify's Forms feature. [Pages Functions](/pages/functions/) are available as an equivalent to Netlify's Serverless Functions.

## Custom Domains

- It is currently not possible to add a custom domain with

  - a wildcard, for example, `*.domain.com`.
  - a Worker already routed on that domain.

- It is currently not possible to add a custom domain with a Cloudflare Access policy already enabled on that domain.

- Cloudflare's Load Balancer does not work with `*.pages.dev` projects; an `Error 1000: DNS points to prohibited IP` will appear.

- When adding a custom domain, the domain will not verify if Cloudflare cannot validate a request for an SSL certificate on that hostname. In order for the SSL to validate, ensure Cloudflare Access or a Cloudflare Worker is allowing requests to the validation path: `http://{domain_name}/.well-known/acme-challenge/*`.

- [Advanced Certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) cannot be used with Cloudflare Pages due to Cloudflare for SaaS's [certificate prioritization](/ssl/reference/certificate-and-hostname-priority/).

## Pages Functions

- [Functions](/pages/functions/) does not currently support adding/removing polyfills, so your bundler (for example, webpack) may not run.

- `passThroughOnException()` is not currently available for Advanced Mode Pages Functions (Pages Functions which use an `_worker.js` file).

- `passThroughOnException()` is not currently as resilient as it is in Workers. We currently wrap Pages Functions code in a `try`/`catch` block and fallback to calling `env.ASSETS.fetch()`. This means that any critical failures (such as exceeding CPU time or exceeding memory) may still throw an error.

## Enable Access on your `*.pages.dev` domain

If you would like to enable [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams-access/)] for your preview deployments and your `*.pages.dev` domain, you must:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. From Account Home, select **Workers & Pages**.
3. In **Overview**, select your Pages project.
4. Go to **Settings** > **Enable access policy**.
5. Select **Edit** on the Access policy created for your preview deployments.
6. In Edit, go to **Overview**.
7. In the **Subdomain** field, delete the wildcard (`*`) and select **Save application**. You may need to change the **Application name** at this step to avoid an error.

At this step, your `*.pages.dev` domain has been secured behind Access. To resecure your preview deployments:

8. Go back to your Pages project > **Settings** > **General** > and reselect **Enable access policy**.
9. Review that two Access policies, one for your `*.pages.dev` domain and one for your preview deployments (`*.<YOUR_SITE>.pages.dev`), have been created.

If you have a custom domain and protected your `*.pages.dev` domain behind Access, you must:

10. Select **Add an application** > **Self hosted** in [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
11. Input an **Application name** and select your custom domain from the _Domain_ dropdown menu.
12. Select **Next** and configure your access rules to define who can reach the Access authentication page.
13. Select **Add application**.

:::caution

If you do not configure an Access policy for your custom domain, an Access authentication will render but not work for your custom domain visitors. If your Pages project has a custom domain, make sure to add an Access policy as described above in steps 10 through 13 to avoid any authentication issues.

If you have an issue that you do not see listed, let the team know in the Cloudflare Workers Discord. Get your invite at [discord.cloudflare.com](https://discord.cloudflare.com), and share your bug report in the #pages-general channel.

## Delete a project with a high number of deployments

You may not be able to delete your Pages project if it has a high number (over 100) of deployments. The Cloudflare team is tracking this issue.

As a workaround, review the following steps to delete all deployments in your Pages project. After you delete your deployments, you will be able to delete your Pages project.

1. Download the `delete-all-deployments.zip` file by going to the following link: [https://pub-505c82ba1c844ba788b97b1ed9415e75.r2.dev/delete-all-deployments.zip](https://pub-505c82ba1c844ba788b97b1ed9415e75.r2.dev/delete-all-deployments.zip).
2. Extract the `delete-all-deployments.zip` file.
3. Open your terminal and `cd` into the `delete-all-deployments` directory.
4. In the `delete-all-deployments` directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Review the following commands to decide which deletion you would like to proceed with:

- To delete all deployments except for the live production deployment (excluding [aliased deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/#preview-aliases)):

```sh
CF_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_CF_API_TOKEN> CF_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> CF_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME=<PROJECT_NAME> npm start
```

- To delete all deployments except for the live production deployment (including [aliased deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/#preview-aliases), for example, `staging.example.pages.dev`):

```sh
CF_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_CF_API_TOKEN> CF_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> CF_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME=<PROJECT_NAME> CF_DELETE_ALIASED_DEPLOYMENTS=true npm start
```

To find your Cloudflare API token, log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), select the user icon on the upper righthand side of your screen > go to **My Profile** > **API Tokens**.

To find your Account ID, refer to [Find your zone and account ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

## Use Pages as Origin in Cloudflare Load Balancer

[Cloudflare Load Balancing](/load-balancing/) will not work without the host header set. To use a Pages project as target, make sure to select **Add host header** when [creating a pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool), and set both the host header value and the endpoint address to your `pages.dev` domain.

Refer to [Use Cloudflare Pages as origin](/load-balancing/pools/cloudflare-pages-origin/) for a complete tutorial.
