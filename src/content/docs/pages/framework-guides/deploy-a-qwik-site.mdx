[Qwik](https://github.com/builderio/qwik) is an open-source, DOM-centric, resumable web application framework designed for best possible time to interactive by focusing on [resumability](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/), server-side rendering of HTML and [fine-grained lazy-loading](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/progressive/#lazy-loading) of code.

In this guide, you will create a new Qwik application implemented via [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/) (Qwik's meta-framework) and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages.

## Creating a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to create a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Qwik's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Qwik project, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args="my-qwik-app --framework=qwik"
/>

`create-cloudflare` will install additional dependencies, including the [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#check-your-wrangler-version) and any necessary adapters, and ask you setup questions.

As part of the `cloudflare-pages` adapter installation, a `functions/[[path]].ts` file will be created. The `[[path]]` filename indicates that this file will handle requests to all incoming URLs. Refer to [Path segments](/pages/functions/routing/#dynamic-routes) to learn more.

After selecting your server option, change the directory to your project and render your project by running the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

<Render file="tutorials-before-you-start" />

<Render file="framework-guides/create-github-repository" />

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

<Render file="deploy-via-c3" params={{ name: "Qwik" }} />

### Deploy via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers & Pages** > **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
3. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

<PagesBuildPreset framework="qwik" />

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `npm`, your project dependencies, and building your site before deploying it.

:::note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

:::

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.
Every time you commit new code to your Qwik site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, to preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

## Use bindings in your Qwik application

A [binding](/pages/functions/bindings/) allows your application to interact with Cloudflare developer products, such as [KV](/kv/concepts/how-kv-works/), [Durable Object](/durable-objects/), [R2](/r2/), and [D1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/).

In QwikCity, add server-side code via [routeLoaders](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/route-loader/) and [actions](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/action/). Then access bindings set for your application via the `platform` object provided by the framework.

The following code block shows an example of accessing a KV namespace in QwikCity.

```typescript null {4,5}
// ...

export const useGetServerTime = routeLoader$(({ platform }) => {
  // the type `KVNamespace` comes from the @cloudflare/workers-types package
  const { MY_KV } = (platform.env as { MY_KV: KVNamespace }));

  return {
    // ....
  }
});
```
