[Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com) is a static site generator, written in Python. With Pelican, you can write your content directly with your editor of choice in reStructuredText or Markdown formats.

## Create a Pelican project

To begin, create a Pelican project directory. `cd` into your new directory and run:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pelican
```

Then run:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Create a directory in your project named `content`:

```sh
mkdir content
```

This is the directory name that you will set in the build command.

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Pages:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers & Pages** > **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
3. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, select _Pelican_ as your **Framework preset**. Your selection will provide the following information. The build command `pelican content` refers to the `content` folder you made earlier in this guide.

<PagesBuildPreset framework="pelican" />

4. Select **Environment variables (advanced)** and set the `PYTHON_VERSION` variable with the value of `3.7`.

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.

Every time you commit new code to your Pelican site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests and be able to preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.
