[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is an open-source React.js framework for building full-stack applications. This section helps you deploy a full-stack Next.js project to Cloudflare Pages using [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/tree/main/packages/next-on-pages/docs).

:::note
You may want to consider using [`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare), which allows you to build and deploy Next.js apps to [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/static-assets/), use [Node.js APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) that Cloudflare Workers supports, and supports additional Next.js features.

Refer to the [OpenNext docs](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) and the [Workers vs. Pages compatibility matrix](/workers/static-assets/compatibility-matrix/) for more information to help you decide whether Workers or Pages currently fits best for your Next.js app.
