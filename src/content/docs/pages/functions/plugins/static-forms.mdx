The Static Forms Pages Plugin intercepts all form submissions made which have the `data-static-form-name` attribute set. This allows you to take action on these form submissions by, for example, saving the submission to KV.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @cloudflare/pages-plugin-static-forms
```

## Usage

```typescript
import staticFormsPlugin from "@cloudflare/pages-plugin-static-forms";

export const onRequest: PagesFunction = staticFormsPlugin({
	respondWith: ({ formData, name }) => {
		const email = formData.get("email");
		return new Response(
			`Hello, ${email}! Thank you for submitting the ${name} form.`,
		);
	},
});
```

```html
<body>
	<h1>Sales enquiry</h1>
	<form data-static-form-name="sales">
		<label>Email address <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
		<label>Message <textarea name="message"></textarea></label>
		<button type="submit">Submit</button>
	</form>
</body>
```

The Plugin takes a single argument, an object with a `respondWith` property. This function takes an object with a `formData` property (the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) instance) and `name` property (the name value of your `data-static-form-name` attribute). It should return a `Response` or `Promise` of a `Response`. It is in this `respondWith` function that you can take action such as serializing the `formData` and saving it to a KV namespace.

The `method` and `action` attributes of the HTML form do not need to be set. The Plugin will automatically override them to allow it to intercept the submission.
