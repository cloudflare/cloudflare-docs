Pages Functions allows you to build full-stack applications by executing code on the Cloudflare network with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, handling form submissions, or working with middleware. [Workers runtime features](/workers/runtime-apis/) are configurable on Pages Functions, including [compatibility with a subset of Node.js APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs) and the ability to set a [compatibility date or compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/). Use Functions to deploy server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.
