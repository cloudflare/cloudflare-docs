Configuration Rules allow you to customize certain Cloudflare [configuration settings](/rules/configuration-rules/settings/) for matching incoming requests.

The configuration rule expression will determine to which requests the rule settings will apply. For more information on expressions, refer to [Expressions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) and [Edit expressions in the dashboard](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).
