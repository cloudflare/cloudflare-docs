1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Configuration Rules**.
3. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule**. To duplicate an existing rule, select the three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.
4. (Optional) Select one of the rule templates that address common use cases. Then, review and adjust the proposed rule configuration.
5. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
6. Under **When incoming requests match**, select if you wish to apply the rule to all incoming requests or only to requests that match a custom filter expression.
7. (Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit expressions in the dashboard](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).
8. Under **Then the settings are**, add the [configuration settings](/rules/configuration-rules/settings/) you wish to change for requests matching the rule expression.
9. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.
