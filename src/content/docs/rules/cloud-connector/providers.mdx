# Supported cloud providers

Cloud Connector currently supports the following cloud providers and services:

- Amazon Web Services - S3
- Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Storage
- Microsoft Azure - Blob Storage

:::note
Support for Cloudflare R2 will be added soon.
:::

## Amazon Web Services - S3

The hostname of your S3 bucket URL must have one of the following formats (where `*` is a wildcard character):

- `*s3.amazonaws.com`
- `*s3-website.<REGION>.amazonaws.com`
- `*s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com`
- `*s3-website-<REGION>.amazonaws.com`

Cloud Connector supports both subdomain and URI path-style URLs:

- **Subdomain-style URLs**: Set the hostname to `{BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com`. In this case, your files are accessible directly under the root of the bucket. For example, `https://example.com/index.html` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html`.
- **URI path-style URLs**: Set the hostname to `s3.amazonaws.com`. Here, your bucket name must be part of the URI path in your requests. For example, if your bucket name is `BUCKET-NAME`, files will be available on paths like `https://example.com/BUCKET-NAME/index.html`, and your Cloud Connector rule should filter traffic based on the URI path starting with `/BUCKET-NAME`.

### Get the bucket URL

1. Go to the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and select **Buckets** in the navigation pane.
2. Select the bucket name.
3. Go to the **Properties** tab.
4. Select the **Static Website Hosting** card. The **Endpoint** field shows your bucket URL.

For more information, refer to the [Configuring an Amazon Web Services static site to use Cloudflare](/support/third-party-software/others/configuring-an-amazon-web-services-static-site-to-use-cloudflare/#set-up-your-site-on-cloudflare) tutorial and [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EnableWebsiteHosting.html).

## Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Storage

The hostname of your Cloud Storage bucket URL must be the following (where `*` is a wildcard character):

- `*storage.googleapis.com`
- `*storage.cloud.google.com`

Cloud Connector supports both subdomain and URI path-style URLs:

- **Subdomain-style URLs**: Set the hostname to `{BUCKET_NAME}.storage.googleapis.com`. In this case, your files are accessible directly under the root of the bucket. For example, `https://example.com/index.html` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.storage.googleapis.com/index.html`.
- **URI path-style URLs**: Set the hostname to `storage.googleapis.com`. Here, your bucket name must be part of the URI path in your requests. For example, if your bucket name is `BUCKET-NAME`, files will be available on paths like `https://example.com/BUCKET-NAME/index.html`, and your Cloud Connector rule should filter traffic based on the URI path starting with `/BUCKET-NAME`.

### Get the bucket URL

1. Go to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) and select **Buckets**.
2. Select the bucket name.
3. For one of the files already in the bucket, select the link icon in the **Public** column to copy the file's public URL to the clipboard. The file URL will have the following format:

   `https://storage.googleapis.com/<BUCKET_NAME>/<OBJECT_NAME>`

   To obtain the subdomain bucket URL, refactor the file URL to `<BUCKET_NAME>.storage.googleapis.com` format.<br/>
   To obtain the URI path bucket URL, remove `https://` and `/<BUCKET_NAME>/<OBJECT_NAME>` from the file URL.

If the files in your bucket are not publicly accessible, you must change the bucket permissions. For details, refer to the [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public#buckets).

## Microsoft Azure - Blob Storage

The hostname of your Blob Storage bucket URL must have one of the following formats:

- `<BUCKET_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net`
- `<BUCKET_NAME>.web.core.windows.net`

For Azure Blog Storage, Cloud Connector supports only subdomain URLs like `{BUCKET_NAME}.blob.core.windows.net`. This means that your files will be accessible directly under the root of the bucket. For example, `https://example.com/index.html` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/index.html`.

### Get the bucket URL

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select your storage account.
2. In the menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Endpoints**.
3. Get your bucket URL from the **Blob service** endpoint or the **Static website** endpoint.

If the blob container is not configured for public access, you must change the container settings. For details, refer to the [Azure Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-configure?tabs=portal).
