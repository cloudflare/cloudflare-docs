To serve static assets from an Azure Blob Storage container:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Navigate to **Rules > Cloud Connector**.
3. Select **Microsoft Azure - Blob Storage** as your [cloud provider](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/).
4. Enter the bucket URL. Hereâ€™s how to structure it:
   - **Subdomain-style URL**: Set the hostname to `<BUCKET_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net`. In this case, your bucket should include a folder named `static-assets`, and files should be placed inside this folder. For example, `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/static-assets/style.css` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/static-assets/style.css`.
5. _(Optional)_ Use the [Rewrite URL](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) feature of [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/) to adjust the URL structure. For example, you can [create a URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/) that changes `/static-assets` to `/my-pages-project/static-assets` to match the file structure of your object storage bucket.
6. Click **Next** and enter a descriptive name like "Serve static assets from Azure" in Cloud Connector name.
7. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and enter the following expression:
   `http.request.full_uri wildcard "https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/static-assets/*"`<br />
8. Select **Deploy** to activate the rule.

This setup ensures that all traffic to `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/static-assets/*` is served from your Azure Blob Storage container. Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
