To route requests to `/images` on your domain to an AWS S3 bucket:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Navigate to **Rules > Cloud Connector**.
3. Select **Amazon Web Services - S3** as your [cloud provider](/rules/cloud-connector/providers/).
4. Enter the bucket URL. You can structure this in two ways:
   - **Subdomain-style URL**: Set the hostname to `<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com`. In this case, your files should be organized in the root of the bucket, meaning the URI path will map directly to the file. For example, `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/file.jpg` will map to `https://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com/images/file.jpg`.
   - **URI path-style URL**: Set the hostname to `s3.amazonaws.com`. Here, your bucket must include a folder named `images`, and files should be placed inside this folder. The URI path will then include the bucket name, like `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/<BUCKET_NAME>/images/file.jpg` mapping to `https://s3.amazonaws.com/<BUCKET_NAME>/images/file.jpg`.
5. _(Optional)_ Use the [Rewrite URL](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) feature of [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/) to adjust the URL structure. For example, you can [create a URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/) that changes `/images` to `/<BUCKET_NAME>/images` to match the URI path-style URL structure.
6. Click **Next** and enter a descriptive name like "Route images to S3" in Cloud Connector name.
7. Under **If**, select **Custom filter expression** and enter the following expression:
   `http.request.full_uri wildcard "https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/*"`<br />
   Replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with desired hostname.
8. Select **Deploy** to activate the rule.

This setup will route all traffic to `https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/images/*` directly to your S3 bucket. Make sure to replace `<YOUR_HOSTNAME>` with your actual hostname and adjust the example paths according to your setup.
