		const countryMap = {
			// Replace the country codes and target URLs with ones that apply to your case.
			US: "https://example.com/us",
			EU: "https://example.com/eu",

		// more on the cf object: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request#incomingrequestcfproperties

			);
			return Response.redirect(url);
