```js
export default {

		const response = await fetch(request);

		// Clone the response so that it is no longer immutable
		const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);

		if (request.cf.botManagement.score < 30) {
			const honeypot = "https://example.com/";
			return await fetch(honeypot, request);
		} else {
			return newResponse;

	},
