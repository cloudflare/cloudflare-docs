Cloudflare Snippets (beta) provide a powerful and flexible way to customize the behavior of your website or application using short pieces of JavaScript code. With Snippets, you can modify HTTP response headers, implement <GlossaryTooltip term="JSON web token (JWT)" prepend="JSON web token (JWT) is ">JWT</GlossaryTooltip> validation, perform complex <GlossaryTooltip term="redirect">redirects</GlossaryTooltip>, and much more.

For code samples addressing common use cases, please refer to the [Examples](/rules/snippets/examples/) section.

## Snippets elements

To create and deploy a Snippet, you need to define the following elements:

- **Code snippet**: JavaScript code to be executed during the request-handling process.
- **Snippet rule**: A [filter expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that determines which requests the Snippet will be applied to. Each Snippet can only be associated with one Snippet Rule.

For more information, refer to the [How it works](/rules/snippets/how-it-works/) and [Create in the dashboard](/rules/snippets/create-dashboard/) sections.

:::caution[Redirects will count as subrequests]
Each <GlossaryTooltip term="Snippets subrequest" prepend="A subrequest is ">subrequest</GlossaryTooltip> in a redirect chain counts against the subrequest limit. This means that if a subrequest was redirected it would count as two subrequests. To avoid issues, ensure that you make a subrequest to the end location of the redirect chain.
