import { Render } from "~/components";

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to create a compression rule via API.

## Basic rule settings

When creating a compression rule via API, make sure you:

- Set the rule action to `compress_response`.
- Define the parameters in the `action_parameters` field according to the [settings](/rules/compression-rules/settings/#api-configuration-settings) you wish to override for matching requests.
- Deploy the rule to the `http_response_compression` phase at the zone level.

## Procedure

<Render
	file="rules-creation-workflow"
	params={{ one: "a compression rule", two: "http_response_compression" }}
/>

## Examples

For example API requests, refer to the [Examples gallery](/rules/compression-rules/examples/).
