The Cloudflare dashboard provides the following settings to manage URL normalization:



* **Normalization type** (default: *RFC-3986*)

  * Selects the type of normalization to perform:

    * *RFC-3986* – Applies URL normalization strictly according to [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

    * *Cloudflare* – In addition to what is defined in RFC 3986, applies [extra URL normalization techniques](/rules/normalization/how-it-works/#cloudflare-normalization).

* **Normalize incoming URLs** (default: *On*)

  * Configures the URLs of all incoming traffic to Cloudflare:

    * When enabled, all incoming URLs are normalized before they pass to subsequent Cloudflare features that can receive a URL as input, such as Page Rules, WAF custom rules, Workers, and Access.
    * When disabled, incoming URLs are not normalized before passing to subsequent Cloudflare features.

* **Normalize URLs to origin** (default: *Off*)

  * Configures URLs sent to the origin:

    * When enabled, requests sent to the origin are normalized.
    * When disabled, requests sent to the origin are not modified.

  * You can only view and enable this option when **Normalize incoming URLs** is enabled.



For examples of how these settings affect URL normalization, refer to the [URL normalization examples](/rules/normalization/examples/).
