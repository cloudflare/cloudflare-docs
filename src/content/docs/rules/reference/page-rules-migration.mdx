Cloudflare recommends that you consider using modern Rules features for your new implementations instead of Page Rules. Follow the recommendations in this migration guide to learn about the [new Rules products](/rules/) and how you can start adopting them today.

## Page Rules migration

Cloudflare plans to migrate your existing Page Rules during 2025. You do not need to migrate your own rules, as Cloudflare will handle this process for you. However, it is beneficial to understand the correspondence between the different Page Rules settings and new Rules features ahead of the migration. This will help you familiarize yourself with implementing the new types of rules in your Cloudflare account.

We encourage you to explore and start using the new Rules products to take advantage of their enhanced capabilities and features. This migration guide will be updated in the coming months with additional information about the Page Rules migration. Some instructions may also change as we simplify configuration deployment and release new features as part of this project. Cloudflare users will receive email updates about the migration of the Page Rules configured on their Cloudflare account before the migration occurs. We will not perform any migration or changes on your behalf without prior notification.

## Context

Cloudflare Page Rules has several fundamental limitations, such as triggering solely based on URL patterns and being limited to 125 rules per zone for performance reasons. These rules are also complex to debug when multiple page rules apply to the same incoming request.

In 2022, we announced in our blog post [The future of Page Rules](https://blog.cloudflare.com/future-of-page-rules) that Page Rules would be replaced with a suite of dedicated products, each built to be best-of-breed and put more power into the hands of our users. The new Rules products — [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/), [Compression Rules](/rules/compression-rules/), [Origin Rules](/rules/origin-rules/), [Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/), and [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/) — are now generally available (GA) and have already been adopted by tens of thousands of Cloudflare customers.

Improvements in modern Rules features include:

- **New engine**: New Rules features are powered by the [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/), which offers versatile configuration with a robust language that supports many HTTP request and response fields.
- **Improved scalability**: Thanks to the improved scalability, Cloudflare plans now have increased quotas.
- **Easier troubleshooting**: Rule execution is more predictable, since each rule operates independently, simplifying troubleshooting. Additionally, [Cloudflare Trace](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/trace-request/) helps understand rule interactions.
- **Improved consistency**: New Rules features also ensure consistency, with common fields and capabilities shared across products, offering a seamless experience and predictable Terraform configurations.

## Important differences

The evaluation and execution order of Rules features is different from Page Rules:

- Requests handled by Workers will suppress Page Rules actions, but they will not suppress actions from modern Rules features.
- The first Page Rule to match is applied (also called first match). In contrast, other rules like Cache Rules are stackable. This means that multiple matching rules can be combined and applied to the same request (last match). For example, if multiple cache rules match the same URL, then the features set in those cache rules will all be applied in order. For more information, refer to [Order and priority](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/order/) in the Cache documentation and the [Origin Rules FAQ](/rules/origin-rules/faq/#what-happens-if-more-than-one-origin-rule-matches-the-current-request).
- A Page Rule may include multiple configurations for different products that are applied in a sequence selected by the customer. In contrast, modern Rules features are evaluated [in a fixed sequence](/rules/origin-rules/#execution-order), with a customer being able to define the rule order within a product [phase](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/). Refer to the [Ruleset Engine documentation](/ruleset-engine/about/) for more information.
- Modern Rules features will take precedence over Page Rules. For example, if you have Page Rules and Cache Rules defining caching settings for the same path, Cache Rules will take precedence.

### Behavior change in Cache Rules

There is a behavior change between Page Rules and Cache Rules: when you select **Eligible for cache** in a cache rule, the Cache Everything feature is now enabled by default.

If you need to keep the exact same behavior you had with Page Rules, you will need to make some additional configurations. For details, refer to [Migration from Page Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/page-rules-migration/) in the Cache documentation.

## Convert Page Rules URLs to filter expressions

When migrating a Page Rule you will need to write a filter expression equivalent to your Page Rules URL using the Rules language.

Rule filter expressions are built differently from Page Rules URLs. You can use different elements of the Rules language in a filter expression, including [fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/), [functions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/), and [operators](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/).

You will need to adapt your Page Rules URLs when migrating them to modern rules. In the Rules language, use the `wildcard` and `strict wildcard` operators (case insensitive and case sensitive operator, respectively) for [wildcard matching](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching). Enterprise and Business customers can use regular expressions, but it will also require adapting the original URLs in your Page Rules to regular expressions.

### Matching full URIs with wildcards

The Page Rules URL matching does not take into account the URI scheme (for example, `https://`) and the query string of incoming requests, unless included in the rule URL. However, the `http.request.full_uri` field used in filter expressions includes the URI scheme and the query string (when the incoming request includes one). When writing a filter expression equivalent to a Page Rule URL, you may want to perform wildcard matching on the full URI. To check for a match regardless of the URI scheme and query string, you can add a `*` wildcard at the beginning and at the end of the literal string with wildcards.

For example, if you were using the Page Rules URL `example.com/*/downloads/*.txt`, in modern Rules features you could use an expression such as `http.request.full_uri wildcard *example.com/*/downloads/*.txt*` to make sure it matches any scheme and any query string.

Alternatively, you could match on individual hostname and URI path fields instead of the full URI field. For example, `http.host eq "example.com" and http.request.uri.path wildcard "/*/downloads/*.txt"`. This was the conversion method followed in the table with example conversions from Page Rules URLs to filter expressions.

### Example conversions from Page Rules URLs to filter expressions

The following table lists the most common Page Rule URLs and their equivalent filters:

### Replace Disable Security

:::caution
The **Disable Security** setting is deprecated. Any Page Rules with this setting will not be migrated.
:::

This Page Rules setting turns off Email Obfuscation, Rate Limiting (previous version), Scrape Shield, URL (Zone) Lockdown, and WAF managed rules (previous version). You can still turn on or off relevant Cloudflare features one by one using Configuration Rules and WAF custom rules.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

**Context:**

You configured a Page Rule with **Disable Security** (deprecated) for all subdomains of `example.com` and the `example.com` domain itself:

- **URL**: `*example.com/*`
- **Setting**: _Disable Security_

This setting turned off a subset of Cloudflare security features: Email Obfuscation, Rate Limiting (previous version), Scrape Shield, URL (Zone) Lockdown, and WAF managed rules (previous version).

**How to replace**:

1. [Create a configuration rule](/rules/configuration-rules/create-dashboard/) to turn off one or more security features:

   - Email Obfuscation (part of [Cloudflare Scrape Shield](/waf/tools/scrape-shield/))
   - Hotlink Protection (part of Cloudflare Scrape Shield)

2. If required, [create a WAF exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/define-dashboard/) to skip one or more rules of WAF managed rulesets for requests coming from IP addresses in an allowlist.

3. Turn off your existing Page Rule and validate the behavior of the rules you created.

4. If your tests succeed, delete the existing Page Rule.

:::caution
If you are still using WAF managed rules (previous version) or Rate Limiting (previous version), consider migrating to the new versions of these products. It is not possible to turn off these older products using modern Rules features. Refer to the [WAF's migration guides](/waf/reference/migration-guides/) for more information.
