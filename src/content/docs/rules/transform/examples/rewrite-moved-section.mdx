import { Example } from "~/components"

To rewrite everything under `/blog/<PATH>` to `/marketing/<PATH>` you must modify the first component of the path (`/blog/`). Create a rewrite URL rule and use the [`regex_replace()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#regex_replace) function for this purpose:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/blog/")
```

Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to...** > *Dynamic*:

```txt
regex_replace(http.request.uri.path, "^/blog/", "/marketing/")
```

</Example>

The `regex_replace()` function matches the path component on a regular expression (`^/blog/`) and then provides a replacement for that match (`/marketing/`).
