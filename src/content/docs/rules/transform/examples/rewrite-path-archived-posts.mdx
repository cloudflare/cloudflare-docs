import { Example } from "~/components";

To rewrite all requests to `/news/2012/...` to `/archive/news/2012/...` you must add a reference to the content of the original URL. Create a new rewrite URL rule and define a dynamic URL path rewrite using an expression:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/news/2012/")
```

Text after **Path** > **Rewrite to...** > _Dynamic_:

```txt
concat("/archive", http.request.uri.path)
```

</Example>

The filter uses the [`starts_with()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#starts_with) function all paths starting with `/news/2012/`. The dynamic path rewrite uses the [`concat()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#concat) function to concatenate a prefix to the original URL path of the HTTP request.
