  Rules) to add a `set-cookie` HTTP header to the response with a static value

import { Example } from "~/components";

The following HTTP response header modification rule adds a header named `set-cookie` with a static value (`cookiename=value`) to the response:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/en/")
```

Selected operation under **Modify response header**: _Add_

**Header name**: `set-cookie`

**Value**: `cookiename=value`

</Example>

This rule would keep any existing `set-cookie` headers already present in the response.
