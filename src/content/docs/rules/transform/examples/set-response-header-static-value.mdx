import { Example } from "~/components";

The following HTTP response header modification rule sets a header named `X-Source` to a static value (`Cloudflare`) in the response:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/en/")
```

Selected operation under **Modify response header**: _Set static_

**Header name**: `X-Source`

**Value**: `Cloudflare`

</Example>

This rule would overwrite any existing `X-Source` headers already present in the response.
