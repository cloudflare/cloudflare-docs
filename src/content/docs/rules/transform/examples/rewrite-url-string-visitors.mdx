import { Example } from "~/components"

To rewrite a request to the `/blog` path to `/blog?sort-by=date`, create a rewrite URL rule with the following settings:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
http.request.uri.path == "/blog"
```

Text after **Query** > **Rewrite to...** > *Static*:

```txt
sort-by=date
```

</Example>

Additionally, set the path rewrite action of the same rule to *Preserve* so that the URL path does not change.
