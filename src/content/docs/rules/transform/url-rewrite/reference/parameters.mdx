Static and dynamic URL rewrites have different parameters:

- A static URL rewrite requires a static value for the target URL.
- A dynamic URL rewrite requires an expression that, when evaluated, will define the target URL.

A URL rewrite with wildcard patterns is a simplified interface in the Cloudflare dashboard for creating dynamic URL rewrites with [wildcard matching and replacement](#wildcard-matching-and-replacement).

The maximum length of all parameter values in a URL rewrite (combined) is 4,096 characters. For example, you could provide a static value (or an expression) for the URI path with 2,048 characters and a static value (or expression) for the query string with 2,048 characters.

## API information

### Static URL rewrites

The full syntax of the `action_parameters` field for a static rewrite URL rule that rewrites both the URI path and the query string is the following:

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "uri": {
    "path": {
      "value": "<URI_PATH_VALUE>"
    },
    "query": {
      "value": "<QUERY_STRING_VALUE>"
    }
  }
}
```

If you are only rewriting the URI path or the query string, omit the `query` or `path` parameter, respectively.

### Dynamic URL rewrites

The full syntax of the `action_parameters` field for a dynamic rewrite URL rule that rewrites both the URI path and the query string is the following:

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "uri": {
    "path": {
      "expression": "<URI_PATH_EXPRESSION>"
    },
    "query": {
      "expression": "<QUERY_STRING_EXPRESSION>"
    }
  }
}
```

If you are only rewriting the URI path or the query string, omit the `query` or `path` parameter, respectively.

#### Wildcard matching and replacement

The syntax of a dynamic rewrite URL rule that rewrites both the URI path and the query string based on wildcard matching and replacement is the following:

```json
{
	"expression": "(http.request.full_uri wildcard r\"<REQUEST_URL>\")",
	"action_parameters": {
		"uri": {
			"path": {
				"expression": "wildcard_replace(http.request.uri.path, r\"<PATH_TARGET_PATH>\", r\"<PATH_REWRITE_TO>\")"
			},
			"query": {
				"expression": "wildcard_replace(http.request.uri.query, r\"<QUERY_TARGET_QUERY>\", r\"<QUERY_REWRITE_TO>\")"
			}
		}
	},
	"action": "rewrite"
	// ...
}
```

The `<REQUEST_URL>`, `<PATH_TARGET_PATH>`, `<PATH_REWRITE_TO>`, `<QUERY_TARGET_QUERY>`, and `<QUERY_REWRITE_TO>` value placeholders correspond to the fields available in the Cloudflare dashboard when you select the **Wildcard pattern** option. For more information, refer to [Wildcard pattern parameters](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/create-dashboard/#wildcard-pattern-parameters).

:::note
The `http.request.uri.query` field does not include the `?` delimiter at the beginning, which means that your `<QUERY_TARGET_QUERY>` value should not try to match an initial `?`.

### Different URL rewrite types in the same rule

The same rule can have different types of URL rewrites for the URI path and the query string. For example, a single rule can perform a **dynamic** URL rewrite of the URI path and a **static** URL rewrite of the query string. The syntax of such a rule would be the following:

```json
"action_parameters": {
  "uri": {
    "path": {
      "expression": "<URI_PATH_EXPRESSION>"
    },
    "query": {
      "value": "<QUERY_STRING_VALUE>"
    }
  }
}
```
