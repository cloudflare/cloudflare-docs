    content: Create a rewrite URL rule in the dashboard
---

Refer to the [Rules examples gallery](/rules/transform/examples/?operation=Rewrite+URL) for examples of rule definitions.

To create a rule:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and website.

2. Go to **Rules** > **Transform Rules**.

3. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule**. To duplicate an existing rule, select the three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.

4. In the rule creation page, enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

5. Under **If incoming requests match**, select one of the following options:

   - **Wildcard pattern**: The rule will only apply to traffic matching the wildcard pattern in **Request URL**. Refer to [Wildcard pattern parameters](#wildcard-pattern-parameters) for details.

   - **Custom filter expression**: The rule will only apply to traffic matching a custom expression. Define the [rule expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/) to configure which requests should be rewritten. Use either the Expression Builder or the Expression Editor to define the custom expression. For more information, refer to [Edit expressions in the dashboard](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).

     :::note
     Check the [fields and functions](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/fields-functions/) you can use in filter expressions of rewrite URL rules.
     :::

   - **All incoming requests**: The rule will apply to all traffic.

6. (Optional) Define the action for your rewrite URL rule by selecting one of the available options displayed as radio buttons, and then a value from the drop-down list, depending on the action:

   - If you select **Rewrite to** > _Static_, enter the string that will replace the original URL path (or query string). For example, enter `welcome-gb.html` to rewrite the original URL path to `/welcome-gb.html`.

   - If you select **Rewrite to** > _Dynamic_, enter a [rewrite expression](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/fields-functions/#rewrite-expressions) that defines the dynamic URL rewrite to perform.

   - If you do not want to change the value of a component of the original request (the URL path or the URL query string), choose the _Preserve_ action for that component.

   For more information, refer to [URL rewrite parameters](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/parameters/).

7. Under **Place at**, define where to place the rule in the rules list: first rule in the list, last rule in the list, or in a custom position (after a given rule).

8. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

If you choose to deploy your rewrite URL rule, the new rule will be enabled. If you save the rule as a draft, the new rule will be disabled.

## Wildcard pattern parameters

The Cloudflare dashboard offers a simplified user interface for creating URL rewrites based on wildcard matching and replacement. When you select **Wildcard pattern**, you will have the following parameters available:

- **Request URL**: Enter the [wildcard pattern](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) using the asterisk (`*`) character to match multiple requests. For example, `https://*.example.com/*`.

- **Then rewrite the path and/or query**: Define the [URL rewrite settings](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/parameters/) including:
  - **Path** > **Target path**: Enter the URI path to match, which can include wildcards (for example, `/oldpath/*`).
  - **Path** > **Rewrite to**: Enter the new URI path. You can use [wildcard replacement](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#wildcard_replace) such as `${1}` and `${2}` to define a dynamic target path (for example, `/newpath/${1}`). Leave this field empty to remove the URI path.
  - **Query** > **Target query**: Enter the query string to match, which can include wildcards (for example, `?sort=*`).
  - **Query** > **Rewrite to**: Enter the new query string. You can use [wildcard replacement](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#wildcard_replace) such as `${1}` and `${2}` to define a dynamic query string (for example, `?order=${1}`). Leave this field empty to remove the query string.

Refer to [URL rewrite parameters](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/parameters/#wildcard-matching-and-replacement) for the equivalent rule configuration when using the API.

:::note[Notes]

The **Request URL** value is only used to match the incoming request with a rule. It will not be used for capturing URL patterns for rewrites. If you are matching the URL path or query string in **Target path** or **Target query**, respectively, make sure that the **Request URL** pattern also matches the incoming request, or else the rule will not trigger.

To validate rewrite URL rule matches, use [Cloudflare Trace](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/trace-request/). To validate rewritten URLs, check your origin server.
