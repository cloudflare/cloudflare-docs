Use HTTP response header modification rules to manipulate the headers of HTTP responses sent to website visitors.

accDescr: Header modification rules can change the headers sent to your origin server (request header modifications) or sent your your website visitors (response header modifications).

A[Visitor]
B((Cloudflare))
C[(Origin server)]

A -.-> B -. "Includes request<br> header modifications" .-> C
C -.-> B == "Includes response<br> header modifications" ==> A

To modify HTTP headers in the **request** sent to your origin server, refer to [HTTP request header modification rules](/rules/transform/request-header-modification/).

Through HTTP response header modification rules you can:

- Set the value of an HTTP response header to a literal string value, overwriting its previous value or adding a new header to the response if it does not exist.
- Set the value of an HTTP response header according to an expression, overwriting its previous value or adding a new header to the response if it does not exist.
- Add a new HTTP response header with a literal string value without removing any existing headers with the same name.
- Remove an HTTP header from the response.

You can create an HTTP response header modification rule [in the dashboard](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/create-dashboard/) or [via API](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/create-api/).

## Important remarks

- The response header values are calculated using the field values from the corresponding HTTP request. For example, the value of `ip.src.country` will be the country of the website visitor, not the origin where the response was sent from.

- You cannot modify or remove HTTP response headers whose name starts with `cf-` or `x-cf-`.

- You cannot modify the value of certain headers such as `server`, `eh-cache-tag`, or `eh-cdn-cache-control`.

- Currently you cannot reference [IP lists](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#lists-with-ip-addresses-ip-lists) in expressions of HTTP response header modification rules.

- The HTTP response header removal operation will remove all response headers with the provided name.

- If you change the value of an existing HTTP response header using an expression that evaluates to an empty string (`""`) or an undefined value, the HTTP response header is **removed**.

- Currently, there is a limited number of HTTP response headers that you cannot change. Cloudflare may remove restrictions for some of these HTTP response headers when presented with valid use cases. [Create a post in the community](https://community.cloudflare.com) for consideration.

- Any response header modifications will also apply to Cloudflare error pages and [custom error pages](/support/more-dashboard-apps/cloudflare-custom-pages/configuring-custom-pages-error-and-challenge/).

- Modifying `cache-control`, `CDN-Cache-Control`, or `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` headers will not change the way Cloudflare caches an object. Instead, you should create a [Cache Rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/).

- To add a `set-cookie` header to the response, make sure you use the _Add_ operation instead of _Set static_/_Set dynamic_. Using one of the _Set_ operations will remove any `set-cookie` headers already in the response, including those added by other Cloudflare products such as Bot Management.

- Currently you can only use the _Add_ operation with a literal string value.
