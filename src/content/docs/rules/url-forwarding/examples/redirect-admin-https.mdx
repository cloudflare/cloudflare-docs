import { Example } from "~/components"

This example dynamic redirect for zone `example.com` will redirect requests for the administration area of a specific subdomain (`store.example.com`) to HTTPS, keeping the original path and query string.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

* **Field:** *SSL/HTTPS*
* **Value:** *Off*

*And*

* **Field:** *Hostname*
* **Operator:** *equals*
* **Value:** `store.example.com`

*And*

* **Field:** *URI Path*
* **Operator:** *starts with*
* **Value:** `/admin`

If you are using the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:<br/>
`(not ssl and http.host eq "store.example.com" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/admin"))`

**Then**

* **Type:** *Dynamic*
* **Expression:** `concat("https://", http.host, http.request.uri.path)`
* **Status code:** *301*
* **Preserve query string:** Enabled

</Example>

The rule includes *SSL/HTTPS: Off* (`not ssl` in the rule expression) to avoid redirect loops.

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                                       | Target URL                                         | Status code |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `http://store.example.com/admin/products/`        | `https://store.example.com/admin/products/`        | `301`       |
| `https://store.example.com/admin/products/`       | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
| `http://store.example.com/admin/?logged_out=true` | `https://store.example.com/admin/?logged_out=true` | `301`       |
| `http://store.example.com/?all_items=true`        | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
| `http://example.com/admin/`                       | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
