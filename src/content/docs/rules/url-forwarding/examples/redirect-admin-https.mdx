import { Example } from "~/components";

This example dynamic redirect for zone `example.com` will redirect requests for the administration area of a specific subdomain (`store.example.com`) to HTTPS, keeping the original path and query string.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `http://store.example.com/admin*`

**Then**

- **Target URL**: `https://store.example.com/${1}`
- **Status code:** _301_
- **Preserve query string:** Enabled

</Example>

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                                       | Target URL                                         | Status code |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `http://store.example.com/admin/products/`        | `https://store.example.com/admin/products/`        | `301`       |
| `https://store.example.com/admin/products/`       | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
| `http://store.example.com/admin/?logged_out=true` | `https://store.example.com/admin/?logged_out=true` | `301`       |
| `http://store.example.com/?all_items=true`        | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
| `http://example.com/admin/`                       | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
