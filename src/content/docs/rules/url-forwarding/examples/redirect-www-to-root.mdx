import { Example } from "~/components";

This example creates a redirect rule that forwards HTTPS requests from the WWW subdomain (`www.example.com`) to the root domain (`example.com`), while retaining the original path and query string.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Wildcard pattern**
  - **Request URL**: `https://www.*`

**Then**

- **Target URL**: `https://${1}`
- **Status code**: _301_
- **Preserve query string**: Enabled

</Example>

This rule ensures that only HTTPS requests from `www.` subdomains are redirected to the root domain, leaving other requests (such as HTTP or non-WWW) unchanged.

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                                       | Target URL                                         | Status code |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `https://www.example.com/products/`               | `https://example.com/products/`                    | `301`       |
| `https://www.store.example.com/products/`         | `https://store.example.com/products/`              | `301`       |
| `https://store.example.com/products/`             | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
| `https://www.example.com/admin/?logged_out=true`  | `https://example.com/admin/?logged_out=true`       | `301`       |
| `http://www.example.com/?all_items=true`          | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
| `http://example.com/admin/`                       | (unchanged)                                        | n/a         |
