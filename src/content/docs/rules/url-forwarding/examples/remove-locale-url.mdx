import { Example } from "~/components";

This example dynamic redirect for zone `example.com` will redirect visitors from an old URL format that included the locale (for example, `/en-us/<page_name>`) to the new format `/<page_name>`.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- **Field:** _URI Path_
- **Operator:** _matches regex_
- **Value:** `^/[A-Za-z]{2}-[A-Za-z]{2}/`

If you are using the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:<br/>
`http.request.uri.path matches "^/[A-Za-z]{2}-[A-Za-z]{2}/"`

**Then**

- **Type:** _Dynamic_
- **Expression:** `regex_replace(http.request.uri.path, "^/[A-Za-z]{2}-[A-Za-z]{2}/(.*)", "/${1}")`
- **Status code:** _301_
- **Preserve query string:** Enabled

</Example>

The function [`regex_replace()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#regex_replace) allows you to extract parts of the URL using regular expressions' capture groups. Create capture groups by putting part of the regular expression in parentheses. Then, reference a capture group using `${<num>}` in the replacement string, where `<num>` is the number of the capture group.

For example, the redirect rule would perform the following redirects:

| Request URL                             | Target URL                        | Status code |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `example.com/en-us/meet-our-team`       | `example.com/meet-our-team`       | `301`       |
| `example.com/pt-BR/meet-our-team`       | `example.com/meet-our-team`       | `301`       |
| `example.com/en-us/calendar?view=month` | `example.com/calendar?view=month` | `301`       |
| `example.com/meet-our-team`             | (unchanged)                       | n/a         |
| `example.com/robots.txt`                | (unchanged)                       | n/a         |
