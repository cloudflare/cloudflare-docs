The following examples will redirect visitors using mobile devices — based on the request user agent string — to a different hostname.

## Redirect mobile users dropping the original URI path

This example static redirect will redirect requests for the current zone (`example.com`) from mobile users to `m.example.com` without preserving the URI path in the original HTTP request.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- Enter the following expression in the [Expression Editor](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/#expression-editor):<br/>
  `not http.host in {"m.example.com"} and (http.user_agent contains "mobi" or http.user_agent contains "Mobi")`

**Then**

- **Type:** _Static_
- **URL:** `m.example.com`
- **Status code:** _301_

</Example>

Notes about this example:

- The `not http.host in {"m.example.com"}` condition prevents redirect loops.
- The user agent condition follows [Mozilla's recommendation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent/Firefox#device-specific_user_agent_strings) for identifying mobile devices.
- The **Then** > **URL** value should be the same as the one you entered in the `http.host` condition of the rule's filter expression.
- You can redirect users to other zones on Cloudflare or to other hostnames not on Cloudflare.

## Redirect mobile users keeping the original path

This example single redirect will redirect requests for the current zone (`example.com`) from mobile users to `m.example.com`, keeping the URI path of the original HTTP request.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**

- Enter the following expression in the [Expression Editor](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/#expression-editor):<br/>
  `not http.host in {"m.example.com"} and (http.user_agent contains "mobi" or http.user_agent contains "Mobi")`

**Then**

- **Type:** _Dynamic_
- **Expression:** `concat("https://m.example.com", http.request.uri.path)`
- **Status code:** _301_

</Example>

Notes about this example:

- The `not http.host in {"m.example.com"}` condition prevents redirect loops.
- The user agent condition follows [Mozilla's recommendation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent/Firefox#device-specific_user_agent_strings) for identifying mobile devices.
- The hostname in **Then** > **Expression** should be the same as the one you entered in the `http.host` condition of the rule's filter expression.
- Depending on your use case, you may want to enable **Then** > **Preserve query string** to also keep the query string of the original request.
- You can redirect users to other zones on Cloudflare or to other hostnames not on Cloudflare.
