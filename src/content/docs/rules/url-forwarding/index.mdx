URL forwarding, also known as URL redirection, navigates the user from a source URL to a target URL with a specific HTTP status code.

Use the following Cloudflare products to perform URL redirects, according to your use case:

- [**Single Redirects**](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/): Allow you to create static or dynamic redirects at the zone level. A simple interface with [wildcard support](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) lets you easily define source and target URL patterns without needing complex functions or regular expressions, efficiently covering thousands of URLs with a single rule.

- [**Bulk Redirects**](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/): Allow you to define a large number of redirects at the account level. These URL redirects are essentially static — they do not support string replacement operations or regular expressions. However, you can configure parameters that affect the redirects' URL matching behavior and their runtime behavior.

- [**Snippets**](/rules/snippets/): Use short pieces of JavaScript code for a more flexible way to define complex redirect functionality. Consider a few [examples](/rules/snippets/examples/?operation=Redirect) to get started.
