import { GlossaryTooltip, Render } from "~/components";

Single Redirects allow you to create static or dynamic URL <GlossaryTooltip term="redirect">redirects</GlossaryTooltip>. A simple interface with [wildcard support](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#wildcard-matching) makes it easy to define source and target URL patterns without needing complex functions or regular expressions, efficiently handling thousands of URLs with a single rule. Dynamic URL redirects also support advanced features such as string replacement operations and [regular expressions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#string-values-and-regular-expressions) (depending on your Cloudflare plan).

	params={{ one: "and customized redirect logic" }}
