import { Render } from "~/components";

Cloudflare Page Rules allows you to override the URL or IP address of a request. This feature is currently available for domains on the Enterprise plan.

<Render file="page-rules-migration" />

A common use case for this functionality is when you are serving an application from a particular URI (`mydomain.com/app`). In this case, the app may live on another server and may even be hosted by a third party. Requests to this endpoint must be directed to the server for that third party application. You can specify a `CNAME` host, as long as the `CNAME` record exists within the Cloudflare DNS.

To make sure you have full control of these records, it is recommended that you set the Resolve Override within the same zone name.

To configure a resolve override in Page Rules, do the following:

1. [Create a DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) (either `CNAME` or `A` record) for your domain.

   - This example shows a `CNAME` record setup to point to `domain.s3.amazonaws.com`.

     - **Type:** `CNAME`
     - **Name:** `resolve.example.com`
     - **Target:** `domain.s3.amazonaws.com`
     - **TTL:** Auto
     - **Proxy status:** Proxied

   - This example uses an `A` record to point to a web server IP address.

     - **Type:** `A`
     - **Name:** `resolve.example.com`
     - **IPv4 address:** `1.2.3.4`
     - **TTL:** Auto
     - **Proxy status:** Proxied

2. [Create a page rule](/rules/page-rules/manage/) to override a URL or an IP address.

   The following example page rule configuration would send all requests from a folder (`/app`) to an AWS S3 bucket:

   - **If the URL matches:** `example.com/app/*`
   - **Setting:** _Resolve Override_ | **Value:** `resolve.example.com`
   - **Setting:** _Host Header Override_ | **Value:** `examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com`

:::caution[Important remarks]

- Page Rules require a [proxied DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records) to work. Page Rules will not apply to subdomains that do not exist in DNS or are not being directed to Cloudflare.

- The _Resolve Override_ setting only allows override of the hostname, not the path. If you need to modify the path also, you will need to either use a [Worker](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#the-cf-property-requestinitcfproperties) or combine the page rule with a [transform rule](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/).
