## Create a page rule

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a page rule in the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Page Rules**.
3. Select **Create Page Rule**.
4. For **URL**, enter the URL or URL pattern that should match the rule ([more details about wildcard matching](/rules/page-rules/reference/wildcard-matching/)).
5. For **Pick a Setting**, select a [Cloudflare setting](/rules/page-rules/reference/settings/) to adjust. If desired, select **Add a Setting** to adjust multiple Cloudflare settings with the same rule.
6. In the **Order** dropdown, specify the desired order: *First, Last* or *Custom*.
7. To save, select one of the following options:

   - **Save as Draft** to save the rule and leave it disabled.
   - **Save and Deploy Page Rule** to save the rule and enable it immediately.

For ideas about what rules you can create, refer to [recommended rules](/rules/page-rules/reference/recommended-rules/).

To create a page rule using the API, send a [`POST` request](/api/operations/page-rules-create-a-page-rule).

You may also want to review the documentation on [wildcard matching](/rules/page-rules/reference/wildcard-matching/), [available settings](/rules/page-rules/reference/settings/), and [recommended rules](/rules/page-rules/reference/recommended-rules/).

:::note[Notes]

- Page Rules require a [proxied DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records) to work. Page Rules will not apply to subdomains that do not exist in DNS or are not being directed to Cloudflare.

- Cloudflare does not support non-ASCII characters — such as punycode/unicode domain — in Page Rules. Instead, you could URL-encode the string using [Punycode converter](https://www.punycoder.com/).
