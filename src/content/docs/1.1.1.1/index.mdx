<Description>

Speed up your online experience with Cloudflare's public DNS resolver.

</Description>

<Plan type="all" />

1.1.1.1, Cloudflareâ€™s public DNS resolver, offers a fast and private way to browse the Internet. DNS resolvers translate domains like `cloudflare.com` into the necessary IP addresses to reach the website (like `104.16.123.96`).

Unlike most DNS resolvers, 1.1.1.1 does not sell user data to advertisers and is the fastest DNS resolver available, deployed in hundreds of cities worldwide with access to millions of domain names.

1.1.1.1 is completely free, easy to set up, and requires no special software.
