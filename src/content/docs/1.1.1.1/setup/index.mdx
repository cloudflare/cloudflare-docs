By default, the [DNS server](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) your devices use is provided by your Internet service provider (ISP). Some [ISPs and network equipment providers](/1.1.1.1/infrastructure/network-operators/) partner with Cloudflare to add safer browsing to their offerings.

If your providers are not currently using Cloudflare, you can change the DNS settings on your device or router as detailed in the following instructions.
