title: Connect to 1.1.1.1 using DoH clients
slug: 1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/dns-over-https-client
---

There are several DoH clients you can use to connect to 1.1.1.1.

## cloudflared

1. [Download and install the `cloudflared` daemon](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).

2. Verify that the `cloudflared` daemon is installed by entering the following command:

   ```sh
   cloudflared --version
   ```

   ```sh output
   cloudflared version 2020.11.11 (built 2020-11-25-1643 UTC)
   ```

3. Start the DNS proxy on an address and port in your network. If you do not specify an address and port, it will start listening on `localhost:53`. DNS (53) is a privileged port, so for the initial demo we will use a different port:

   ```sh
   cloudflared proxy-dns --port 5553
   ```

   ```sh output
   INFO[2020-12-04T19:58:57Z] Adding DNS upstream - url: https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
   INFO[2020-12-04T19:58:57Z] Adding DNS upstream - url: https://1.0.0.1/dns-query
   INFO[2020-12-04T19:58:57Z] Starting metrics server on 127.0.0.1:44841/metrics
   INFO[2020-12-04T19:58:57Z] Starting DNS over HTTPS proxy server on: dns://localhost:5553
   ```

4. You can verify that `cloudflared` is running using a `dig`, `kdig`, `host`, or any other DNS client.

   ```sh
   dig +short @127.0.0.1 -p5553 cloudflare.com AAAA
   ```

   ```sh output
   2606:4700::6810:85e5
   2606:4700::6810:84e5
   ```

5. Run `cloudflared` as a service so it starts on user login. On many Linux distributions, this can be done with:

   ```sh
   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared-proxy-dns.service >/dev/null <<EOF
   ```

   ```sh output
   [Unit]
   Description=DNS over HTTPS (DoH) proxy client
   Wants=network-online.target nss-lookup.target
   Before=nss-lookup.target

   [Service]
   AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
   CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
   DynamicUser=yes
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cloudflared proxy-dns

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOF
   ```

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable --now cloudflared-proxy-dns
   ```

6. Change your system DNS servers to use `127.0.0.1`. On Linux, you can modify `/etc/resolv.conf`:

   ```sh
   sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
   echo nameserver 127.0.0.1 | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf >/dev/null
   ```

7. Finally, verify it locally with:

   ```sh
   dig +short @127.0.0.1 cloudflare.com AAAA
   ```

   ```sh output
   2606:4700::6810:85e5
   2606:4700::6810:84e5
   ```

## DNSCrypt-Proxy

The [DNSCrypt-Proxy](https://dnscrypt.info) 2.0+ supports DoH out of the box. It supports both 1.1.1.1 and other services. It also includes more advanced features, such as load balancing and local filtering.

1. [Install DNSCrypt-Proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation).

2. Verify that `dnscrypt-proxy` is installed and the version is 2.0 or later:

   ```sh
   dnscrypt-proxy -version
   ```

   ```sh output
   2.0.8
   ```

3. Set up the configuration file using the [official instructions](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation#setting-up-dnscrypt-proxy), and add `cloudflare` and `cloudflare-ipv6` to the server list in `dnscrypt-proxy.toml`:

   ```toml
   server_names = ['cloudflare', 'cloudflare-ipv6']
   ```

4. Make sure that nothing else is running on `localhost:53`, and check that everything works as expected:

   ```sh
   dnscrypt-proxy -resolve cloudflare-dns.com
   ```

   ```sh output
   Resolving [cloudflare-dns.com]

   Domain exists:  yes, 3 name servers found
   Canonical name: cloudflare-dns.com.
   IP addresses:   2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:6f19, 2400:cb00:2048:1::6810:7019, 104.16.111.25, 104.16.112.25
   TXT records:    -
   Resolver IP:    172.68.140.217
   ```

5. Register it as a system service according to the [DNSCrypt-Proxy installation instructions](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/installation).
