Use **Rules** to configure whether to track Web Analytics for specific websites or paths. By default, Web Analytics automatically creates a single rule for the zone that injects the JavaScript (JS) snippet for all pages.

Rules are only available for sites proxied through Cloudflare. For more information, refer to [Limits](/web-analytics/limits/).

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select the **Analytics & Logs** drop-down and choose **Web Analytics**.
3. Find the site you want to configure and select **Manage site**.
4. Select **Advanced options** > **Add rule**.
5. Select the **Action** and fill in the hostname and path(s) you want to add a rule for.
6. If you want to add additional rules, select **Add rule**. Otherwise select **Update** to save the rule.
