Web Analytics relies on the `performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')` object to collect metrics about page load performance. If Navigation Timing Level 2 is not supported, then [`performance.timing` (Level 1)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timing) is used.

Refer to the [W3C Processing Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing-2/#processing-model) for a visual depiction of the sequence of timing events for web page loads.

## Data collection and reporting

Web Analytics collects the minimum amount of information - timing metrics - to show customers how their websites perform. Cloudflare does not track individual end users across our customers’ Internet properties.

The Web Analytics performance beacon loads from `https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js`. You may need to update your <GlossaryTooltip term="content security policy (CSP)" link="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy (CSP)</GlossaryTooltip> settings to load this script.

Beacon data is sent to `https://<yourdomainname>/cdn-cgi/rum` for sites proxied through Cloudflare or `https://cloudflareinsights.com/cdn-cgi/rum` for sites not proxied through Cloudflare. Core Web Vital metrics are reported when the `visibilityState` is hidden for the first time after the page load event is triggered.
