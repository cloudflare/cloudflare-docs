Understanding the key metrics in web analytics is essential for optimizing your website’s performance and user experience. Here are the high-level metrics tracked by Cloudflare Web Analytics:

* **Visits** - A page view that originated from a different website or direct link. Cloudflare checks where the HTTP referer does not match the hostname. One visit can consist of multiple page views.
* **Page views** - A successful HTTP response with a content-type of HTML.
* **Page load time** - The total amount of time required to load the page.
* **[Core Web Vitals](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-are-core-web-vitals/)** - Higher-level metrics designed by Google to capture the user experience more completely.
