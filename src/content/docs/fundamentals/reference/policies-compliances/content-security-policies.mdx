    content: Content Security Policies (CSPs) and Cloudflare
---

A **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is an added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including:

- Content/code injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Embedding malicious resources
- Malicious iframes (clickjacking)

To learn more about configuring a CSP in general, refer to the [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/http/csp).

## Using a CSP with Cloudflare

Cloudflare’s [CDN](/cache/) is compatible with CSP.

Cloudflare does not:

- Modify CSP headers from the origin web server (except when using Zaraz, to ensure the [Zaraz script is always running](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-zaraz-supports-csp/)).
- Require changes to acceptable sources for first or third-party content.
- Modify URLs (besides adding the [`/cdn-cgi/` endpoint](/fundamentals/reference/cdn-cgi-endpoint/) and [Cloudflare Fonts](/speed/optimization/content/fonts/) that rewrites Google Fonts urls).
- Interfere with locations specified in your CSP.

If you require the CSP headers to be changed or added, you can change them using some Cloudflare products:

- If your website is [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) through Cloudflare, you can use a [Response Header Modification rule](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/) to replace or add CSP headers.
- If your website is hosted using [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/), you can set a [`_headers file`](/pages/configuration/headers/) to modify or add CSP headers.

### Product requirements

To use certain Cloudflare features, however, you may need to update the headers in your CSP:
