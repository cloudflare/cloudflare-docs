Cloudflare offers a variety of ways to perform <GlossaryTooltip term="redirect">URL redirects</GlossaryTooltip>, which tell a visitor's browser that the location of a page has been changed.

Use the following table to determine when to use each option.

| Option                                                      | Use when                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Single redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/) | As a default option.                                      |
| [Bulk redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/)     | When you have a large number of static redirects.         |
| [Pages redirects](/pages/configuration/redirects/)          | If you have a Pages project.                              |
| [Workers redirect](/workers/examples/redirect/)             | When the other redirects do not meet your needs.          |
| [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/how-to/url-forwarding/)      | If you already rely on Page Rules for other requirements. |
