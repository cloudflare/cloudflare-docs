Once you [set up a new account](/fundamentals/setup/account/) and [add your domain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) to Cloudflare, you may need access to your zone and account IDs for API operations.

To find your zone and account IDs:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).

2. Select your account and domain.

3. On the **Overview** page (the landing page for your domain), find the **API** section.

4. The **API** section contains your **Zone ID** and **Account ID**. To copy these values for API commands or other tasks, select **Click to copy**.
