If you cannot [change your domain nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), you can still use Cloudflare on your website by:

* Activating Cloudflare through a [certified hosting partner](https://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners).
* Using a [partial zone setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).
