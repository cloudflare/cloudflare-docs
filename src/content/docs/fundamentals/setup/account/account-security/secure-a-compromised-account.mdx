If you observe suspicious activity within your Cloudflare account, secure your account with these steps.

## Step 1 - Change your password

For more guidance on changing your password, refer to [Change email address or password](/fundamentals/subscriptions-and-billing/change-password-or-email/).

## Step 2 - Revoke active account sessions

<Render file="revoke-active-sessions" />

## Step 3 - Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

To prevent future compromises, make sure that you have [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/2fa/) enabled on your account.

## Step 4 - Change API keys and tokens

### API keys

<Render file="api-change-api-key" />

### API tokens

<Render file="api-roll-token" />

## Step 5 - Review the audit log

<Render file="view-audit-log" />

If you notice any settings were changed, you should undo those changes.
