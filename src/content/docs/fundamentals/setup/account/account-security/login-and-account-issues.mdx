## Forgot your email?

### Enterprise plans

If you forget the email address associated with your account, contact your Customer Success Manager.

### Free, Pro, and Business plans

If you forget the email address associated with your application:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select **Forgot your email?**.
2. Enter your domain name.
3. Cloudflare will send an email to the email address associated with your domain name. If you do not receive an email within 20 minutes, check your spam folder. The message will be sent from `no-reply@cloudflare.com` or `noreply@notify.cloudflare.com`.

:::note

This process does not affect your account or share your email address with anyone. 
:::

If you still cannot access the email address associated with your Cloudflare account, you may need to [move your domain to another account](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/move-domain/).

Cloudflare requires these steps to prevent account hijacking.

## Sign-in options

You have several sign-in options for the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login):

* **Email and password**: Enter your email address and password to log in.
* **Single sign on (SSO)**: Enter your email address (so long as your admin has [configured SSO](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/) as a sign in option).
* **Sign in with Apple**:
  * *Same Cloudflare account email as Apple ID*: You can either sign in with your email and password or sign in with Apple.
  * *Different Cloudflare account email as Apple ID*: Will create a new Cloudflare account if you sign in with Apple. If you want to log into an existing account, [change your email address](/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/login-and-account-issues/) to match the one used for your Apple ID.

:::note

If you login to your Cloudflare user account with Single Sign-On (SSO), you will not be able to sign in with Apple.
