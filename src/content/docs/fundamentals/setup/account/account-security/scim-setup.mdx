title: Provision with SCIM
updated: 2023-12-08

---

By connecting a System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provider, you can provision access to the Cloudflare dashboard on a per-user basis, through your identity provider (IdP)

Currently, we only provide SCIM support for Enterprise customers, and for Microsoft Entra and Okta. If you are interested in setting up SCIM support, contact your account team and ask for dashboard SCIM.

## Limitations

- If a user is the only Super Administrator on an Enterprise account, they will not be deprovisioned.
- Cloudflare currently only supports [Account-scoped Roles](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/#account-scoped-roles) and does not support Domain-scoped Roles provisioning via SCIM. We are working on this limitation.
- Cloudflare does not currently allow custom group names to leave space for future development.

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare provisioning with SCIM is only available to Enterprise customers and requires a Cloudflare-specific feature flag. Contact your account team for more information.
- In Cloudflare, [Super Administrator](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/) access on the account.
- In your identity provider, the ability to create applications and groups.

:::note

Accounts provisioned with SCIM need to verify their email addresses.

## Provision with Okta

### Set up your Okta SCIM application.

1. In the Okta dashboard, go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Select **Browse App Catalog**.

   * **Do not display application icon to users**
   * **Do not display application icon in the Okta Mobile App**

6. Disable **Automatically log in when user lands on login page**.
7. Select **Next**, then select **Done**.

### Integrate the Cloudflare API.

1. In your integration page, go to **Provisioning** > **Configure API Integration**.
2. Enable **Enable API Integration**.
3. In SCIM 2.0 Base URL, enter: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<your_account_ID>/scim/v2`.
4. In OAuth Bearer Token, enter your API token value.
5. Disable **Import Groups**.
6. Select **Save**.

### Set up your SCIM users.

1. In **Provisioning to App**, select **Edit**.
2. Enable **Create Users** and **Deactivate Users**. Select **Save**.

This will provision all of the users affected to your Cloudflare account with "minimal account access."

### Configure user permissions on Okta

1. Go to **Directory** > **Groups** > **Add group** and add groups with the following names:
   `CF-<your_account_ID> - <Role_Name>` 
   :::note

2. Go to your SCIM application in the App Integration Catalog, then select **Provisioning**.
3. Select **Edit**.
4. Enable **Create Users** and **Deactivate Users**. Select **Save**.

9. Select **Save**.

Adding any users to these groups will grant them the role. Removing the users from the identity provider will remove them from the associated role.

## Provision with Microsoft Entra ID

### Set up the Microsoft Entra ID Enterprise application.

1. Go to your Microsoft Entra ID instance and select **Enterprise Applications**.
2. Select **Create your own application** and name your application.
3. Select **Integrate any other application you don’t find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**.
4. Select **Create**.

### Provision the Microsoft Entra ID Enterprise application.

1. Under **Manage** on the sidebar menu, select **Provisioning**.
2. Select **Automatic** on the dropdown menu for the Provisioning Mode.

4. Select **Test Connection**, then select **Save**.

### Configure user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID

Currently, groups need to match a specific format to provision specific Cloudflare account-level roles. Cloudflare is in the process of adding Cloudflare Groups, which can take in freeform group names in the future.

These permissions work on an exact string match with the form `CF-<your_account_ID> - <Role_Name>`

Refer to the list of [Roles](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/) for more details.

1. To ensure that only required groups are provisioned, go to your Microsoft Entra ID instance.
2. Under Manage on the sidebar menu, select **Provisioning**.
3. Select **Provision Entra Groups** in Mappings.
4. Select **All records** under Source Object Scope.
5. Select **Add scoping filter** and create the appropriate filtering criteria to capture only the necessary groups.
6. Save the Attribute Mapping by selecting **OK** and return to the Enterprise Application Provisioning overview page.
7. Select **Start provisioning** to view the new users and groups populated on the Cloudflare dashboard.
