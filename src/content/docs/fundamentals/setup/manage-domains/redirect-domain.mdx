title: Redirect one domain to another

---

import { Render } from "~/components"

If you have an alias domain that only forwards traffic to another domain (that is, it doesn't have an origin server of its own), you can set up redirects directly within Cloudflare.

1. [Add](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/#add-a-domain-to-cloudflare) your alias domain (for example, `previous.com`) to Cloudflare.

2. Make sure that your alias domain has a proxied [DNS A or CNAME record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) that properly resolves DNS queries. You may also want to include a record for the `www` subdomain.

*You should use the IP address `192.0.2.1` as it will discard traffic but fulfil the function we require. `100::` is the equivalent for an `AAAA` record.*

   | **Type** | **Name** | **IPv4 address** | **Proxy status** |
   | -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
   | A        | `@`      | `192.0.2.1`      | Proxied          |
   | A        | `www`    | `192.0.2.1`      | Proxied          |

3. Use [Redirect rules](/rules/url-forwarding/) to forward traffic from your alias domain to your other domain.
