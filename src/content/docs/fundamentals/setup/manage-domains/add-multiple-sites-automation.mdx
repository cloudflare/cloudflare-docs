title: Add multiple sites via automation
---

import { Render } from "~/components";

To add multiple sites to Cloudflare at once and more efficiently, you can do so via the Cloudflare API.

Adding multiple sites can be useful when you:

- Have multiple domains mapping back to a single, canonical domain (common for domains in different countries - such as `.com.au`, `.co.uk` - that you want protected by Cloudflare).
- Are a [partner](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/), agency, or IT consultancy, and manage multiple domains on behalf of your customers.
- Are moving an existing set of sites over to Cloudflare.

Using the API will allow you to add multiple sites quickly and efficiently, especially if you are already familiar with [how to change your name-servers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/) or [add a DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

This tutorial assumes domains will be added using [full mode](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/).

---

## Prerequisites

To add multiple sites to Cloudflare via automation, you need:

- An existing [Cloudflare account](/fundamentals/setup/account/create-account/).
- Command line with `curl`
- A Cloudflare [API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with one of the following permissions:
  - Zone-level `Administrator`
  - Zone-level `Zone: Edit` and `DNS: Edit`
  - Account-level `Domain Administrator`
- To have disabled [DNSSEC](/dns/concepts/#dnssec) for each domain at your registrar (where you bought your domain name).
  - Follow this [tutorial](/dns/dnssec/dnssec-active-migration/) to migrate an existing DNS zone without having to disable DNSSEC

## Add domains

1. Create a list of domains you want to add, each on a separate line (newline separated), stored in a file such as `domains.txt`.
2. Create a bash script `add-multiple-zones.sh` and add the following. Add `domains.txt` to the same directory or update its path accordingly.

```bash
  for domain in $(cat domains.txt); do
    printf "Adding ${domain}:\n"

    curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "account": {
        "id":"<ACCOUNT_ID>"
      },
      "name": "'"$domain"'",
      "type": "full"
    }'

    printf "\n\n"
  done
```

3. Open the command line and run:

```sh
bash add-multiple-zones.sh
```

After adding a domain, it will be in a [`Pending Nameserver Update`](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) state.

## Additional options

### jq

[`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) is a command-line tool that parses and beautifies JSON outputs.

This tool is a requirement to complete any `Additional options` steps in this tutorial.

```sh
echo '{"foo":{"bar":"foo","testing":"hello"}}' | jq .
```

Refer to `jq` [documentation](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/#basic-filters) for more information.

### Quick scan

Cloudflare offers a [quick scan](/dns/zone-setups/reference/dns-quick-scan/) that helps populate a zone's DNS records. This scan is a best effort attempt based on a predefined list of commonly used record names and types.

This API call requires the domain `ID`. This can be found in the following locations:

- [Create Zone](/api/operations/zones-post#Request)
- [List Zones](/api/operations/zones-get)

Using `jq` with the first option above, modify your script `add-multiple-zones.sh` to extract the domain ID and run a subsequent API call to quick scan DNS records.

```js
  for domain in $(cat domains.txt); do
    printf "Adding ${domain}:\n"

    add_output=`curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "account": {
          "id":"<ACCOUNT_ID>"
        },
        "name": "'"$domain"'",
        "type": "full"
      }'`

    echo $add_output | jq .

    domain_id=`echo $add_output | jq -r .result.id`

    printf "\n\n"
    printf "DNS quick scanning ${domain}:\n"

    scan_output=`curl --request POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$domain_id/dns_records/scan \
      --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
      --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"`

    echo $scan_output | jq .

  done
```

## Update nameservers

For each domain to become active on Cloudflare, it must be activated in either [Full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/) or [Partial setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/). The following script will output a list containing the nameservers associated with each domain.

You can find your zones nameservers in the following locations:

- [Create Zone](/api/operations/zones-post#Request)
- [Zone Details](/api/operations/zones-0-get)

1. Modify your script `add-multiple-zones.sh` to print a CSV with data from the `Create Zone` JSON response.

```js
  for domain in $(cat domains.txt); do
    printf "Adding ${domain}:\n"

    add_output=`curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "account": {
          "id": "<ACCOUNT_ID>"
        },
        "name": "'"$domain"'",
        "type": "full"
      }'`

    # Create csv of nameservers
    echo $add_output | jq -r '[.result.name,.result.id,.result.name_servers[]] | @csv' >> /tmp/domain_nameservers.csv

    domain_id=`echo $add_output | jq -r .result.id`

    printf "\n\n"
    printf "DNS quick scanning ${domain}:\n"

    scan_output=`curl --request POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$domain_id/dns_records/scan \
      --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
      --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"`

    echo $scan_output | jq .

  done

  printf "name_servers are saved in /tmp/domain_nameservers"
  cat /tmp/domain_nameservers.csv
```

| ID         | ZONE          | NAME SERVERS                                      |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \<ZONE_ID> | `example.com` | `arya.ns.cloudflare.com`, `tim.ns.cloudflare.com` |

2. Use the values in the **NAME SERVERS** column to [update the nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#update-your-registrar) at the registrar of each domain.

## Limitations

<Render file="automation-number-limitations" /> <br />

After that, you cannot have more pending sites than active sites associated with your Cloudflare account. We recommend waiting until your pending sites have been [activated](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) before adding additional domains.

## Common issues

If any errors were returned in this process, the domain may not be registered (or only just registered), be a subdomain, or otherwise been invalid. For more details, refer to [Cannot add domain](/dns/zone-setups/troubleshooting/cannot-add-domain/).
