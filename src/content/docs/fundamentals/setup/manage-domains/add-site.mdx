Follow these steps to add your website or application to Cloudflare. Once your domain is [active](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/#active), your web traffic will [proxy through Cloudflare](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-reverse-proxy), which speeds up and protects websites and services on your domain.

Cloudflare will become the primary [DNS provider](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-dns-provider) for your domain, meaning your [DNS records](/dns/concepts/#dns-records) are managed at Cloudflare, and we authoritatively answer all DNS queries.

:::note


These instructions are tailored to customers using a full setup for Cloudflare DNS (the most common configuration). If you are using a [partial setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/) or [secondary setup](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/), your setup process will be different.


:::

## Prerequisites

To use Cloudflare, you need to own a domain (`example.com`).

If you do not already own a domain name and plan to use Cloudflare for your [authoritative DNS](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), we highly recommend purchasing your domain name through [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/get-started/register-domain/).

Using Cloudflare Registrar simplifies your setup process by automatically using Cloudflare for authoritative DNS.

## 2. Update nameservers

<Render file="update-nameservers" product="fundamentals" />

## 3. Complete SSL/TLS setup

To prevent insecure connections and visitor browser errors, [make sure you have SSL/TLS protection](/ssl/get-started/) and go through the **Quick Start Guide** to improve security.

## 4. Go beyond the basics

For suggestions and guidance about getting the most out of your Cloudflare account, refer to our [Fundamental Tasks](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/).
