[Version Management](/version-management/) is available for Enterprise customers and allows you to safely test, deploy, and roll back changes to your zone configurations.


## Enable versioning


<Render file="enable-versioning" product="version-management" />


## (Optional) Create additional environments

<Render file="enable-default-creation" product="version-management" />

These environments each serve a specific purpose and are accessed differently: <Render file="environment-defaults" product="version-management" />

<Render file="create-environment-situation" product="version-management" /> <br/>

For more details, refer to [Create environment](/version-management/how-to/environments/#create-environment).


## Update configurations

<Render file="edit-version" product="version-management" />

## Test version

<Render file="test-version" product="version-management" />

## Promote version


Next, [promote](/version-management/how-to/environments/#change-environment-version) your version through your different environments.

<Render file="promote-version" product="version-management" />

After promoting to each environment, test the new version in your new environment.

## Repeat

For new changes to your zone, [create a new version](/version-management/how-to/versions/#create-version) and repeat this process.
