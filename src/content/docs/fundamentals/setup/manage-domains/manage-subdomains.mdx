Once you have [added your domain to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) and [updated your nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), you also might want to set up a subdomain.

Most subdomains serve a specific purpose within the overall context of your website. For example, `blog.example.com` might be your blog, `support.example.com` could be your customer help portal, and `store.example.com` would be your e-commerce site.

## Create a subdomain

If you have already added a subdomain at your host, create a corresponding [DNS A or CNAME record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) for that subdomain (`blog`, `store`).

## Set up redirects

### Redirect a subdomain to the apex domain

<Render file="redirect-subdomain-to-root" />

### Redirect the apex domain to a subdomain

<Render file="redirect-root-to-subdomain" />

## SSL/TLS for subdomains

<Render file="ssltls-subdomains" product="dns" />

## Customize subdomain behavior

<Render file="subdomain-customization" product="dns" />
