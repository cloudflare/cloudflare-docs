On any Cloudflare account, you can collaborate by adding members to your account and assigning them access via one or several policies.

Every policy has three parts:

1. The actor
2. The role
3. The scope

Refer to the resources below to configure policies to ensure that you can assign only the necessary access permissions to your account members.
