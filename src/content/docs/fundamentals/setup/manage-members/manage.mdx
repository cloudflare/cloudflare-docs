Granting access to others on your account is done with several sets of data principles:

1. Accounts have Account Members.
2. Account Members have policies.
3. Policies are constructed out of actors, roles, and scopes.

When assigning a new user, you can assign a policy to them directly. If multiple policies are needed, they can be added or revoked at a later time.

Learn how to add new account members, edit or revoke their access, and resend verification emails.

## Super Administrator access

If you are a Super Administrator for an account that has existing domains and you decide to leave the account, you can invite a new Super Administrator who will have access to the same account privileges.

You can delete your user as a Super Administrator, but you cannot delete your account. Other Super Administrators will continue to have access to the appropriate privileges to manage the account, including billing information.
