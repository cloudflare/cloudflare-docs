## Review external tools

To avoid blocking Cloudflare IP addresses unintentionally, review your external tools to check that:

* Any security plugins — such as those for WordPress — allow Cloudflare IP addresses.
* The [ModSecurity](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity) plugin is up to date.

### Additional recommendations

#### Further protection

For further recommendations on securing your origin server, refer to our guide on [protecting your origin server](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/protect-your-origin-server/).

### Customize Cloudflare IP addresses

<Render file="customize-cloudflare-ips" product="fundamentals" />

### IP range updates

Cloudflare's IP ranges do not change frequently. When they do change, they are added to our [list of IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/ips/) before being put into production. You can also use the Cloudflare API to programmatically keep your configuration updated.
