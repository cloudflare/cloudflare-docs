title: Preview services

---

Contracted customers can try certain products and features for 30 days.

Once you enable the product or feature, it will not be an officially contracted service until you purchase it. Cloudflare will reach out in case you have any questions or feedback, and provide you with a sales quote if you are enjoying the product.

You may cancel at any time before the 30 days ends by reaching out to your sales team for assistance.

## Available features and products

To enable a preview service, use the **Dashboard link** in the following table. Then, select **Enable**. And that is it. You will have instant access to the product or feature you selected so you can begin determining if it is right for your business’ needs.
