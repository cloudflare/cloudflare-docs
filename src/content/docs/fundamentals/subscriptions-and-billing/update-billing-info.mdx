To avoid potential disruptions in your Cloudflare services, make sure your billing information is current and accurate. It is also important to understand [how Cloudflare plans and add-ons are priced](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/#overview).

If Cloudflare is unable to process your payment, review [Troubleshooting failed payments](/fundamentals/subscriptions-and-billing/troubleshooting-failed-payments/).

## Delete your current payment method

Before removing your payment method from file, you must cancel all Cloudflare paid services.

:::caution


If you currently subscribe to any [add-on services](/support/account-management-billing/billing-add-on-service/), Cloudflare must always have a payment method on file. If you need to remove a payment method, then you must enter a new one to replace it. Otherwise, you will see an error.

You also cannot delete your payment method if a payment fails or if there is an outstanding balance. Until we process payment, you can only add or edit your payment method.

2. On the left sidebar, select **Manage account** > **Billing**.

5. Next to your current payment method, select **Delete**.
