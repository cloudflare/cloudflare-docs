title: Interacting with Cloudflare
---

Once you [set up an account](/fundamentals/setup/account/), you have several ways to interact with Cloudflare.

## Without code

If you prefer working without code, you can manage your account and domain settings through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).

:::note

If your domain was added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.

For those who prefer to interact with Cloudflare programmatically, you can use several methods:
