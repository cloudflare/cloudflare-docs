## Common signs of an attack

Common signs that you are under DDoS attack include:

* Your site is offline or slow to respond to requests.
* There are unexpected spikes in the graph of **Requests Through Cloudflare** or **Bandwidth** in your Cloudflare **Analytics** app.
* There are strange requests in your origin web server logs that do not match normal visitor behavior.

:::note

If you are currently under DDoS attack, refer to our guide on [responding to a DDoS attack](/ddos-protection/best-practices/respond-to-ddos-attacks/).
