## Use Trace in the dashboard

### 1. Configure one or more Cloudflare products

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account.
2. Set configuration settings at the account level, or select a domain and configure settings for one or more Cloudflare products.

### 2. Build a trace

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), go to Account Home > **Trace**.

2. Enter a URL to trace. The URL must include a hostname that belongs to your account.

3. Select an HTTP method. If you select *POST*, *PUT*, or *PATCH*, you should enter a value in **Request body**.

4. (Optional) Define any custom request properties to simulate the conditions of a specific HTTP/S request. You can customize the following request properties:

   * **Protocol** (HTTP protocol version)
   * **Request headers**
   * **Cookies**
   * **Geolocation** (request source [country](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/standard-fields/#ipsrccountry), [region](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/standard-fields/#ipsrcregion), and [city](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/standard-fields/#ipsrccity))
   * [**Bot score**](/bots/concepts/bot-score/)
   * <GlossaryTooltip term="threat score" link="/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/dynamic-fields/#cfthreat_score">**Threat score**</GlossaryTooltip>
   * **Request body** (for `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests)
   * **Skip challenge** (skips a Cloudflare-issued [challenge](/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/), if any, allowing the trace to continue)

5. Select **Send trace**.

### 3. Assess results

The **Trace results** page shows all evaluated and executed configurations from different Cloudflare products, in evaluation order. Any inactive rules are not evaluated.

1. Analyze the different [steps](#steps-in-trace-results) with evaluated and executed configurations for the current trace. Trace results include matches for all active rules and configurations, whether configured at the account level or for a specific domain or subdomain.

   To show all configurations, including the ones that did not match the request, select *All configurations* in the **Results shown** dropdown.

2. (Optional) Update your Cloudflare configuration (at the account or at the domain/subdomain level) and create a new trace to check the impact of your changes.

### 4. (Optional) Save the trace configuration

To run a trace later with the same configuration:

1. Copy the JSON shown in the dashboard with the current trace configuration.
2. When creating a new trace, paste it in the JSON box to define all the settings of the new trace.

## Use Trace via API

Use the [Request Trace](/api/operations/account-request-tracer-request-trace) operation to perform a trace using the Cloudflare API.

***

## Steps in trace results

* Execution of one or more rules of Cloudflare products built on the [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/). Refer to the Ruleset Engine's [Phases list](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) for a list of such products.
* [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/): Execution of one or more rules.
* [Workers](/workers/): Execution of one or more scripts.
