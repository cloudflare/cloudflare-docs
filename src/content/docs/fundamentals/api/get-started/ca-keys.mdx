Origin CA keys are often used as the value of header `X-AUTH-USER-SERVICE-KEY` when interacting with [Origin CA certificates](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/) API. It is also used by [Keyless SSL](/ssl/keyless-ssl/) key server.

:::note
You can also interact with the [Origin CA certificates API](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/#api-calls) using an [API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with **Permissions** that include `Zone`-`SSL and Certificates`-`Edit`.
:::

The key value always starts with `v1.0-`.

## Limitations

* Changing the Origin CA key is not recorded by [Audit Logs](/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/).
* Each time you view the Origin CA key, it will be presented as a different value. All these different values are **simultaneously valid** until you click the `Change` button, which immediately invalidates all previously generated values.
* Origin CA keys have access to every account the user has access to.
