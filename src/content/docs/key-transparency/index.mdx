<Description>

Secure the distribution of public keys in your end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging systems

</Description>

Cloudflare's Key Transparency Auditor aims to secure the distribution of public keys for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging systems like [WhatsApp](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/). It achieves this by building a verifiable append-only data structure called a Log, similar to [Certificate Transparency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency).

Cloudflare acts as an auditor of Key Transparency Logs to ensure the transparency of end-to-end encrypted messaging public keys. Cloudflare provides an API for anyone to monitor the verification work we perform, and verify the state of its associated Logs locally.
