The Auditor is designed to sign epoch information, which includes the time at which the request is received by the Auditor, the epoch number, and the epoch digest. The Auditor serialises these information in binary using protobuf or bincode and checks whether the requested inclusion is valid, as in not seen, and incremental.

If the Log is setup to provide [AKD](https://github.com/facebook/akd) audit proof, the Auditor verifies them asynchronously.
