Once you [add and activate](/learning-paths/get-started-free/onboarding/add-and-activate/) your domain at Cloudflare, check that all your DNS records are set up correctly.

## Can you visit your website?

If your website already existed before adding it to Cloudflare, the easiest way to test DNS resolution is to try and visit your domain (`example.com`) or a subdomain (`www.example.com`).

As long as you [reviewed](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#review-dns-records) your DNS records when adding your domain, everything should work just fine.

### Potential issues

Sometimes, domains added to Cloudflare can experience issues in DNS resolution.

## Does your domain's email still work?

If your domain supported email beforehand, try sending a few emails to your domain's address.

If those emails cannot be delivered, the issue is usually with your domain's `MX` DNS records. For help, refer to the following resources:

* [Vendor-specific DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/vendor-specific-records/)
