Your load balancer should be receiving production traffic (and you can confirm this by reviewing the [analytics](/load-balancing/reference/load-balancing-analytics/)).

Though your product is officially set up, you may want to consider the following suggestions.

## Usage-based notifications

<Render file="ubb-recommendation" product="fundamentals" />

## Additional configuration options

You may want to further customize how your load balancer routes traffic or integrate your load balancer with other Cloudflare products:

<DirectoryListing folder="load-balancing/additional-options" />
