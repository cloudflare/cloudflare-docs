There's more to a load balancer than just distributing traffic, however.

After all, what good would it be if your load balancer and pools send a request to a server that's offline? Or one that's already overloaded with traffic? Ideally, your load balancer should only forward requests that a server can take care of.

That's where another part of the load balancing equation comes in: monitors and health checks.
