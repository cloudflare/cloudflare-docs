Before, we covered how requests move from load balancers to pools and then from pools to individual servers.

What we did not mention, however, was *how* the load balancer and pools make those decisions.

This is a concept known as routing.

## How it works

Generally, there are five questions involved with routing:

1. By default, how does the load balancer distribute requests to pools?
2. By default, how do pools distribute requests to individual servers?
3. Within a pool, which servers are healthy?
4. Within a load balancer, which pools are healthy?
5. Are there any specialized routing rules?

### Distributing requests to pools

A load balancer's [traffic steering policy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) controls how the load balancer distributes requests to pools.

Routing decisions can be based on proximity, pool performance, geography, and more.

### Distributing requests within pools

Once the request reaches a pool, that pool's [endpoint steering policy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/) controls how each pool distributes requests to the servers in the pool.

These decisions can be based on default percentages of traffic sent to individual servers (also known as the **Weight**), aspects of the request (such as source IP address), or both.

### Endpoint health

If an endpoint fails a health check - which would mark it as unhealthy - its pool will adjust routing according to its endpoint steering policy.

Both new and existing requests will go to healthy endpoints in the pool, ignoring the unhealthy endpoint.

### Pool health

With enough unhealthy endpoints, the pool itself may be considered unhealthy as well.

#### Fallback pools

Often, load balancers have a special pool known as the **Fallback Pool**, which receives traffic no matter what.

### Specialized routing

Finally, specific settings can also affect the ways a load balancer distributes traffic, such as:

* Routing based on [specific aspects](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/) of the request.
* Sending all requests from a [specific end user](/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/) to the same server, preserving information about their user session like items in a shopping cart.
