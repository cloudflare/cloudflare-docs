## Customizations

Based on the characteristics of your server pools, you have several customization options that affect how and whether a server is considered unhealthy.

### Pool-level settings

#### Health threshold

<Render file="pool-health-threshold" product="load-balancing" /> <br/>

#### Health monitor regions

<Render file="health-check-regions" product="load-balancing" />

##### Configurations

<Render file="monitor-health-check-regions-options" product="load-balancing" />

### Monitor-level settings

When you [create a monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/), there are several configuration settings you can adjust based on the characteristics of the attached pools:


<Details header="Basic settings">

<Render file="monitor-settings-basic" product="load-balancing" />


</Details>


<Details header="Advanced settings">

<Render file="monitor-settings-advanced" product="load-balancing" />


</Details>

<Render file="monitor-settings-consecutive" product="load-balancing" />
