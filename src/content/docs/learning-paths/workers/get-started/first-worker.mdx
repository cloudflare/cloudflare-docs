## Build and deploy your first Worker

You can deploy your first Worker via the Cloudflare dashboard or programmatically using your terminal.

You must have a Cloudflare account to create a Worker. To get started with Cloudflare and create an account, refer to [Get started with Cloudflare](/learning-paths/get-started/).

### Via the Cloudflare dashboard

<Render file="get-started-dash" product="workers" />

### Via C3 and Wrangler

#### Prerequisites

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

#### Create and deploy your first Worker

<Render file="c3-definition" product="workers" />

To create your Worker project, run:

<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="cloudflare@latest" args={"first-worker"} />

This will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) package, and lead you through setup.

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World Worker",
		lang: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

You will be asked if you would like to deploy the project to Cloudflare.

- If you choose to deploy, you will be asked to authenticate (if not logged in already), and your project will be deployed to the Cloudflare global network and available on your custom [`workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/).

- If you choose not to deploy, go to the newly created project directory to begin writing code. Deploy your project by running the [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) command.

Refer to [How to run Wrangler commands](/workers/wrangler/commands/#how-to-run-wrangler-commands) to learn how to run Wrangler commands according to your package manager.

In your Worker project directory, C3 has generated the following:

1. `wrangler.toml`: Your [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#sample-wranglertoml-configuration) configuration file.
2. `index.js` (in `/src`): A minimal `'Hello World!'` Worker written in [ES module](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) syntax.
3. `package.json`: A minimal Node dependencies configuration file.
4. `package-lock.json`: Refer to [`npm` documentation on `package-lock.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json).
5. `node_modules`: Refer to [`npm` documentation `node_modules`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/folders#node-modules).

To continue building your Worker, open the `index.js` file to write your code. Refer to [Examples](/workers/examples/) to use ready-made code you can experiment with.

## Summary

You have learned how to:

- Create and deploy a Worker project using the Cloudflare dashboard and programmatically, using your terminal.

In the next section, you can follow a video tutorial to create your first Cloudflare Workers application.
