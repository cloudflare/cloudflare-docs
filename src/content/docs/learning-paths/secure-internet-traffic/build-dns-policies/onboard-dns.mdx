The fastest way to start filtering DNS queries is to change your DNS resolver to use a specific Gateway endpoint. You can make this change at the browser, OS, or router level.

Choose this option if:

- You want to try out DNS filtering without installing software.
- You do not need to filter by user identity.
- You want to apply blanket DNS policies to all devices in a physical location, such as a retail store or office.

## Change DNS resolver in browser

To configure your browser to send traffic to Gateway:

1. Obtain your DNS over HTTPS (DoH) address:

   1. Go to **Gateway** > **DNS locations**.
   2. Select **Add a location**.
   3. Enter a name for the location.
   4. Turn on **Set as Default DNS Location**.
   5. Select **Add location**.
   6. Copy your **DNS over HTTPS** hostname: `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`

2. Follow the configuration instructions for your browser:

   <Render file="gateway/doh-instructions" product="cloudflare-one" />

3. Verify that third-party firewall or TLS decryption software does not inspect or block traffic to the DoH endpoint: `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.

DNS filtering is now turned on for this browser.

To configure your router or OS, or to add additional DNS endpoints, refer to [DNS locations](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/).
