Egress policies allow you to determine whether your organization's traffic egresses via the default Cloudflare IP or via a [dedicated egress IP](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/) assigned to your account.

To create a new egress policy:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Egress policies**.

2. Select **Add a policy**.

3. Name the policy.

4. Build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to control egress for. For example, you can add a policy to configure all traffic destined for a thrid-party network to use a static source IP:

   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/egress-destination-ip"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />

5. Select **Create policy**.

For more information, refer to [Egress policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/).
