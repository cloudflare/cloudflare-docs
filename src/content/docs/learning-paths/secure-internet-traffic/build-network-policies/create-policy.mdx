You can control network-level traffic by filtering requests by selectors such as IP addresses and ports. You can also integrate network policies with an [identity provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/) to apply identity-based filtering.

To create a new network policy:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies**.
2. In the **Network** tab, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Under **Traffic**, build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to allow or block.
5. Choose an **Action** to take when traffic matches the logical expression.
   <Render

   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />
6. Select **Create policy**.

For more information, refer to [network policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/).
