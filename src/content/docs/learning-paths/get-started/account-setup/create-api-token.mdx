If you plan to use the [Cloudflare API](/api/) to manage your account programmatically, you need an API token (or API key) to authenticate your requests.

The benefit of an API token - as opposed to an API key - is that you can limit tokens to [specific permissions](/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/), zones, IP addresses, and a specific validity period.

## Create a token
