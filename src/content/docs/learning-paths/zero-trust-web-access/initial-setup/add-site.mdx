In clientless ZTWA deployments, users connect to internal applications via public hostnames. You will need to own a domain, add it to Cloudflare, and configure Cloudflare as the [authoritative DNS provider](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#update-your-nameservers) for that domain. Enterprise customers who cannot change their authoritative DNS provider have the option to configure a [partial (`CNAME`) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).

You only need to add one domain to Cloudflare, since you can create an infinite number of subdomains to manage all of your private applications.

## Add a site to Cloudflare

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select **Add a site**.
3. Enter your websiteâ€™s apex domain (`example.com`).
4. Select a [plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/#compare-features) for this website. Everything you need to do with the domain in Cloudflare Zero Trust is available on the **Free** plan.
5. Select **Continue**. Cloudflare will scan your website for any configured DNS records.

  :::note

  If Cloudflare is unable to identify your domain as a registered domain, make sure you are using an existing [top-level domain](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/top-level-domain/) (`.com`, `.net`, `.biz`, or others).

  Additionally, Cloudflare requires your `apex domain` to be one level below a valid TLD defined in the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/master/public_suffix_list.dat).

5. Review your DNS records and select **Continue**.
6. <Render file="update-nameservers" product="fundamentals" />
7. (Optional) Follow the **Quick Start Guide** to configure security and performance settings.

Registrars can take up to 24 hours to process nameserver changes. Your domain must be in an **Active** status before you can use it for Zero Trust Web Access.
