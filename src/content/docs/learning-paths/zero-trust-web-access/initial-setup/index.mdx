In this guide, you will learn how to deliver Zero Trust Web Access using the Cloudflare Zero Trust suite of products. This guide will focus on browser-based applications that do not require users to install a device client of any kind. It will discuss both common and complex scenarios, and should give you the tools to provide secure user access to internal web applications following a Zero Trust model.

If you need to deliver access to non-browser based applications, refer to our complementary guide for [replacing your VPN](/learning-paths/zero-trust-web-access/).

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Set up a Cloudflare account.
* Add your domain to Cloudflare.
