Cloudflare Tunnel allows you to securely connect your applications to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP â€” instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (`cloudflared`) creates outbound-only connections to Cloudflare's global network.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Create a Cloudflare Tunnel.
* Publish your application via a public hostname.
