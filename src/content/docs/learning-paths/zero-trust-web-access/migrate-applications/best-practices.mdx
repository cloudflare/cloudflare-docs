Most customers have a heterogeneous private application portfolio; some are home-built, some are internal managed services, some have SSO integrations available, and some rely on HTML or other forms of authentication. With that in mind, we recommend that you mix-and-match [onboarding solutions](/learning-paths/zero-trust-web-access/migrate-applications/integrated-sso/#potential-solutions) to fit the needs of each individual application. As shown in the table below, you can bucket applications into a series of stack-ranked categories that prioritize ease of implementation and total organizational impact.
