## Enable the proxy

<Render file="tunnel/enable-gateway-proxy" product="cloudflare-one" />

Cloudflare will now proxy traffic from enrolled devices, except for the traffic excluded in your [split tunnel settings](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp). For more information on how Gateway forwards traffic, refer to [Gateway proxy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/proxy/).
