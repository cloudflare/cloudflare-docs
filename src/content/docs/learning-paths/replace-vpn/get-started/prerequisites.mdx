To make the most of this learning path, make sure that you have the following:

* A device that can run [WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/), Cloudflare's endpoint agent.
* A private network with applications or services that are available locally or via a VPN.
* A [host server](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/system-requirements/#recommendations) on the private network that can run the lightweight Cloudflare Tunnel daemon process.
* (Optional) A [Linux host server](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/#linux) on the private network that can run the Cloudflare WARP Connector. This is only needed for server-initiated traffic flows such as Microsoft SCCM, Active Directory (AD) updates, and DevOps workflows that require server-initiated connections.
