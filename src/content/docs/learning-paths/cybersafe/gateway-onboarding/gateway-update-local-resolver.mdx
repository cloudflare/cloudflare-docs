With a Gateway location created, you have the ability to send traffic to your environment. You can test without risk by changing your DNS resolvers in your browser or network settings.

## Change DNS resolver at the network level

## Change DNS resolver in the browser

To configure your browser to send traffic to Gateway:

1. Obtain your DNS over HTTPS (DoH) address:
   1. Go to **Gateway** > **DNS Locations**.
   2. Select the default location.
   3. Copy your **DNS over HTTPS** hostname: `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`

2. Follow the configuration instructions for your browser:

   <Render file="gateway/doh-instructions" product="cloudflare-one" />

3. Verify that third-party firewall or TLS decryption software does not inspect or block traffic to the DoH endpoint: `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.

## More locations

To configure your router or OS, or to add additional DNS endpoints, refer to [DNS locations](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/).
