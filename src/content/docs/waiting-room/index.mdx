<Description>

A virtual waiting room to manage peak traffic.
</Description>

<Plan type="business" />

Cloudflare Waiting Room allows you to route excess users of your website to a customized waiting room, helping preserve customer experience and protect origin servers from being overwhelmed with requests.

***

## Benefits

Waiting Room protects your origin server by preventing surges in legitimate traffic that may overload your origin.

Waiting Room also benefits your visitors by:

- Keeping your application online and preventing them from reaching error pages.
- Showing estimated wait times that are continuously updated.
- Opening up new spots more quickly by tracking dynamic inflow and [outflow](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/#session-duration).
- Remembering each visitor's status to prevent someone from losing their place in line or having to re-queue if they leave your site.
- Appearing in your own [branding and style](/waiting-room/how-to/customize-waiting-room/), which enhances trust and lets you provide additional information as needed.
