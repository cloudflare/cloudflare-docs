## Additional details

### New users per minute

When you configure `new users per minute`, this value **is not** the number of users added per minute.

Instead, it is the threshold of users allowed per minute (less than or equal to the number of `total active users`). You should set this value at 100% of your expected peak traffic to ensure users are only queued when necessary.

### Session duration

Session duration improves user experience in two ways.

First, it prevents visitors from having to pass through a waiting room twice for the same transaction. For example, a visitor might want to make a purchase at `example.com`. There's a lot of traffic at `example.com`, so they queue in the waiting room before entering the online store. After a period of time, they leave the waiting room and enter the online store. They make a purchase and leave the online store.

However, they forgot to add a note to the order or request a receipt. As long as their [session cookie](/waiting-room/reference/waiting-room-cookie/) is still valid (for the length of time specified by the `session duration`), they can re-enter your application without having to re-queue in the waiting room.

Second, session duration lets your waiting room create a dynamic outflow from your application (in addition to dynamic inflow). A user's session cookie expires after a period of inactivity, meaning that new spots can open up as soon as space becomes available and estimated wait times are lower and more accurate.
