Improve your network visibility and detect DDoS attacks based on traffic flows.

Magic Network Monitoring provides visibility into your network traffic by analyzing network <GlossaryTooltip term="flow data">flow data</GlossaryTooltip> sent from a customer’s routers. Magic Network Monitoring supports NetFlow v5, NetFlow v9, IPFIX, and sFlow.

Magic Network Monitoring is generally available to everyone with a Cloudflare account by default. You can log in to your Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, then go to **Analytics & Logs** > **Magic Monitoring** to get started.

Everyone can use the [free version](/magic-network-monitoring/magic-network-monitoring-free/) of Magic Network Monitoring in a home network, network lab, or business to get end to end visibility across their network traffic. Potential enterprise customers are encouraged to use the free version to run a proof of concept.

Enterprise customers can use Magic Network Monitoring with [Magic Transit on-demand](/magic-transit/on-demand/) to monitor their network, identify volumetric DDoS attacks, and activate Magic Transit on-demand to mitigate those attacks.
