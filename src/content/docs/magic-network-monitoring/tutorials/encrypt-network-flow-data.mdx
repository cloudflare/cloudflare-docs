Customers can encrypt the network flow data sent from their router to Cloudflare by routing their network flow traffic through a device running the WARP client. Then, encrypted network flow traffic can be forwarded from the WARP enabled device to Cloudflare's network flow endpoints.

To learn more about the WARP client, and to install the WARP client on Linux, macOS, or Windows, you can visit the [WARP client documentation](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/).
