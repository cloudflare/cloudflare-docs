You can use Logpush with Magic Firewall IDS to log detected risks:

1. Consult the [Logpush Destination docs](/logs/get-started/api-configuration#destination) to learn about what destinations Logpush supports. The documentation will also instruct you on how to correctly format the destination URL for Logpush.

2. Follow the [Manage Lopush with cURL](/logs/tutorials/examples/example-logpush-curl) tutorial to validate your Logpush destination and define a Logpush job.

## Notes on using Logpush with IDS

* Magic IDS is an account-scoped dataset. This means the string `/zone/<ZONE_ID>` in the Cloudflare API URLs in the tutorial should be replaced with `/account/<ACCOUNT_ID>`.

* Consult the [Magic IDS Detection fields doc](/logs/reference/log-fields/account/magic_ids_detections/) to know what fields you want configured for the job.

* When creating the Logpush job, the dataset field should equal `magic_ids_detections`.

* Timestamps by default are unixnano. Consult the [Logpush Options docs](/logs/get-started/api-configuration#options) to learn what format you can choose that will be compatible with your destination and/or expectations. Note that all options must be added *after* all fields you want from the Logpush job, akin to URL parameters.
