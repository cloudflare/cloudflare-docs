Review the content below to learn more about concepts related to Magic Firewall.

:::caution[Important]


When using Magic Firewall alongside other Cloudflare services that proxy traffic (for example, CDN and Spectrum), be aware of the following:

* Firewall rules that block traffic based on source IP address may not work as intended because rules are evaluated after Cloudflare terminates the incoming TCP connections.
* You must allow [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).
* When using Magic Firewall, fragmented <GlossaryTooltip term="data packet">packets</GlossaryTooltip> are reassembled into complete packets before they are inspected. As a result, you cannot create firewall rules for fragments.
