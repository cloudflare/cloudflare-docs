Magic Firewall supports [Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2543) to inspect traffic validity and enforce a positive security model.

You can use the `sip` field when creating a rule to determine if packets are valid SIP Layer 7 (L7) protocol. Refer to [Magic Firewall fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#magic-firewall-fields), specifically the `sip` field, for more information on this topic.

Contact your account manager if you need Magic Firewall to support additional protocols.
