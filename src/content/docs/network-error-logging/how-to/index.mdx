Use NEL reports to view information such as:

* Why a request failed
* The country a request failed from
* The last mile network a request failed from
* The Cloudflare data center the request was most likely meant for

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Analytics & Logs** > **Edge Reachability**.

Click a tab under **Reachability summary** to view specific information related to your Origin ASN, Origin, IP, or data center. Hover over a location on the map to view the number of reachable requests.

Under **Reachability by data center**, click a location under Data Centers to filter reachability by a specific location.
