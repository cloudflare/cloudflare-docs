[Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) is a command-line tool for building with Cloudflare developer products.

Use Wrangler to deploy projects that use the Workers Browser Rendering API.

## Install

To install Wrangler, refer to [Install and Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## Bindings

[Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Cloudflare developer platform. A browser binding will provide your Worker with an authenticated endpoint to interact with a dedicated Chromium browser instance.

To deploy a Browser Rendering Worker, you must declare a [browser binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your Worker's [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file.

:::note[Wrangler configuration]

If you are using [Puppeteer](/browser-rendering/platform/puppeteer/) in your Worker code, then you also need to add "nodejs_compat_v2" to the compatibility_flags in your Worker's [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration). More information [here](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/#enable-nodejs-with-workers), including for [pages functions](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/#enable-nodejs-with-pages-functions).
:::

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
# Top-level configuration
name = "browser-rendering"
main = "src/index.ts"
workers_dev = true
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat_v2"]

browser = { binding = "MYBROWSER" }
```

</WranglerConfig>

After the binding is declared, access the DevTools endpoint using `env.MYBROWSER` in your Worker code:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch(env.MYBROWSER);
```

Run [`npx wrangler dev --remote`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) to test your Worker remotely before deploying to Cloudflare's global network. Local mode support does not exist for Browser Rendering so `--remote` is required. To deploy, run [`npx wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy).
