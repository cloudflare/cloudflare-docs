You can initialize and customize the Turnstile widget on your web page via implicit or explicit rendering.

:::caution

`api.js` must be fetched from the exact URL stated below. Proxying or caching this file will result in Turnstile failing when future updates are released.
:::

## Implicitly render the Turnstile widget

:::note

Refer to the [demo](https://demo.turnstile.workers.dev/) and its [source code](https://github.com/cloudflare/turnstile-demo-workers/blob/main/src/implicit.html).
:::

The HTML is scanned for elements that have a `cf-turnstile` class name:

<div>

```html
<div
	class="cf-turnstile"
	data-sitekey="yourSitekey"
	data-callback="javascriptCallback"
></div>
```

</div>

Once a challenge has been solved, a token is passed to the success callback. This token must be validated against our siteverify endpoint. A token can only be validated once and cannot be consumed twice.

<Render file="siteverify-warning" />

:::note

Once a token has been issued, it can be validated within the next 300 seconds. After 300 seconds, the token is no longer valid and another challenge needs to be solved.
:::

To configure the challenge, refer to [Configurations](/turnstile/get-started/client-side-rendering/#configurations) containing data attributes and render parameters.

### Protect forms

Turnstile is often used to protect forms on websites such as login forms, contact forms, and more. After inserting the JavaScript script tag, you can embed `<div class="cf-turnstile"></div>` into your site to protect your forms.

<div>

```html title="Example" {4}
<form action="/login" method="POST">
	<input type="text" placeholder="username" />
	<input type="password" placeholder="password" />
	<div class="cf-turnstile" data-sitekey="<YOUR_SITE_KEY>"></div>
	<button type="submit" value="Submit">Log in</button>
</form>
```

</div>

An invisible input with the name `cf-turnstile-response` is added and will be sent to the server with the other fields.

:::note

A form is not protected by having a widget rendered. The corresponding token that is a result of a widget being rendered also needs to be verified using the siteverify API.
:::

### Disable implicit rendering

You can disable implicit rendering by replacing the script from:

```txt
https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js
```

To:

```txt
https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?render=explicit
```

When using `render=explicit`, HTML elements with the `cf-turnstile` class will not show a challenge. The `turnstile.render` function must be invoked using the following steps. To combine both options, pass a query string of `?render=explicit&onload=onloadTurnstileCallback`:

`https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?render=explicit&onload=onloadTurnstileCallback`

## Explicitly render the Turnstile widget

:::note

Refer to the [demo](https://demo.turnstile.workers.dev/explicit) and its [source code](https://github.com/cloudflare/turnstile-demo-workers/blob/main/src/explicit.html).
:::

1. Insert the JavaScript tag and the related code below. Ensure that you have renamed the class name of `.cf-turnstile` to `#example-container` (if you do not set the `render=explicit` query string option as shown above, it will still render otherwise). Once the script is embedded, you will have access to a global function with multiple callback options you can customize. For the following function to work properly, the page must contain an HTML element with ID `example-container`.

<div>

```html title="JavaScript tag"
<script
	src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?onload=onloadTurnstileCallback"
	defer
></script>
```

</div>

<div>

```javascript title="Related code"
window.onloadTurnstileCallback = function () {
	turnstile.render("#example-container", {
		sitekey: "<YOUR_SITE_KEY>",
		callback: function (token) {
			console.log(`Challenge Success ${token}`);
		},
	});
};
```

</div>

Or:

<div>

```html title="JavaScript tag"
<script src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js?render=explicit"></script>
```

</div>

<div>

```javascript title="Related code"
// if using synchronous loading, will be called once the DOM is ready
turnstile.ready(function () {
	turnstile.render("#example-container", {
		sitekey: "<YOUR_SITE_KEY>",
		callback: function (token) {
			console.log(`Challenge Success ${token}`);
		},
	});
});
```

</div>

Turnstile can be programmatically loaded by invoking the `turnstile.render()` function in the global `window` object.

The `turnstile.render: function (container: string | HTMLElement, params: RenderParameters)` render takes an argument to a HTML widget.

If the invocation is successful, the function returns a `widgetId (string)`. If the invocation is unsuccessful, the function returns `undefined`.

## Access a widget's state

In addition to the `render()` function, Turnstile supports obtaining the widget's response from a `widgetId` via the `turnstile.getResponse(widgetId: string)` function. If you omit the `widgetId`, `turnstile.getResponse()` returns the response from the last created widget.

After some time, a widget may become expired and needs to be refreshed (by calling `turnstile.reset(widgetId: string)`). If a widget has expired, `turnstile.getResponse()` will still return the last response, but the response will no longer be valid because it has expired.

You can check if a widget has expired by either subscribing to the `expired-callback` or using the `turnstile.isExpired(widgetId: string)` function, which returns `true` if the widget is expired. If you omit `widgetId`, `turnstile.isExpired()` returns whether the last created widget is expired or not.

## Reset a widget

If a given widget has timed out, expired or needs to be reloaded, you can use the `turnstile.reset(widgetId: string)` function to reset the widget.

## Remove a widget

Once a widget is no longer needed, it can be removed from the page using `turnstile.remove(widgetId: string)`. This will not call any callback and will remove all related DOM elements.

To unmount Turnstile, `turnstile.render()` will return an ID which you can pass to `turnstile.remove()`.

## Refresh an expired token

A few seconds before a token expires, the `expired-callback` is invoked.

The `refresh-expired` or `data-refresh-expired` parameter defines the behavior when the token of a Turnstile widget has expired.

By default, the parameter is set to `auto`, which will automatically instruct Turnstile to obtain a new token by rerunning the challenge. After the challenge is solved again, the `callback`, if specified, is invoked with the new token.

The visitor can also be instructed to manually obtain a new token by setting the `refresh-expired` parameter to `manual`.

Additionally, specifying `never` will not result in a regeneration of a token, and the application using Turnstile will be responsible for obtaining a novel Turnstile token.

## Refresh a timed-out widget

When managed mode is chosen, Turnstile may present the visitor with an interactive challenge at times. If this interactive challenge is presented but was not solved within a given time period, it will time out and Turnstile's challenge process will need to be restarted.

The `refresh-timeout` or `data-refresh-timeout` parameter defines the behavior when the interactive challenge encounters a timeout. By default, the widget automatically refreshes (`auto`). However, the widget can also be configured such that the visitor needs to manually refresh a timed-out widget (`manual`), or the widget can only refreshed externally (`refresh-timeout="never"`) by the application (e.g. by calling Turnstile's `reset()` function).

When a widget is encountering the interactivity timeout the `timeout-callback` is invoked.

## Execution modes

By default, Turnstile tokens are obtained for a visitor upon the rendering of a widget (even in invisible mode). However, in some scenarios, an application may want to embed Turnstile, but defer running the challenge until a certain point in time. This is where execution mode can be used to control when a challenge runs and a token is being generated.

There are two options:

- The challenge runs automatically after calling the `render()` function.
- The challenge runs after the `render()` function has been called, by invoking the `turnstile.execute(container: string | HTMLElement, jsParams?: RenderParameters)` function separately.

  This detaches the appearance and rendering of a widget from its execution.

## Appearance modes

If a widget is visible, its appearance can be controlled via the `appearance` parameter.

By default, `appearance` is set to `always` for visible widget types. However, if `appearance` is set to `execute`, the widget will only become visible after the challenge begins. This is helpful in situations where `execute()` is called after `render()`. If `appearance` is set to `interaction-only`, the widget will become only visible in cases where an interaction is required.

Refer to [Widget types](/turnstile/concepts/widget/) to see widgets by type and state.

## Widget size

The Turnstile widget can have two different fixed sizes or a flexible width size when using the Managed or Non-interactive modes:

<Render file="widget-size" />

```html title="Flexible width example"
<div style="display: block; flex-flow: row;">
	<div
		class="cf-turnstile"
		data-sitekey="1x00000000000000000000AA"
		data-size="flexible"
	></div>
</div>
```

```html title="Compact mode example"
<div style="display: block; flex-flow: row;">
	<div
		class="cf-turnstile"
		data-sitekey="1x00000000000000000000AA"
		data-size="compact"
	></div>
</div>
```
