Follow the steps below to enable SSL/TLS protection for your application.


## Before you begin


* [Create an account and register an application](/fundamentals/setup/)



## Choose an edge certificate

As explained in the [concepts page](/ssl/concepts/#ssltls-certificate), edge certificates are the SSL/TLS certificates that Cloudflare presents to your visitors.

Cloudflare offers a variety of options for your application's edge certificates:

* [**Universal certificates**](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/): <GlossaryDefinition term="Universal SSL certificate" />
* [**Advanced certificates**](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/): <Render file="acm-definition" />
* [**Custom certificates**](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/): <Render file="custom-certificates-definition" />
* [**Keyless certificates**](/ssl/keyless-ssl/) (Enterprise only): <Render file="keyless-ssl-definition" />

Refer to [Edge certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/) for more information on how different certificate types can respond to common use cases.

For more details, refer to [Cloudflare for SaaS (managed hostnames)](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/).

## Choose your encryption mode


Once you have chosen your edge certificate, [choose an encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/).

Encryption modes specify how Cloudflare encrypts connections between (a) visitors and Cloudflare, and (b) Cloudflare and your origin server. For more context about this two-part process refer to the [concepts page](/ssl/concepts/#ssltls-certificate).

Note that some encryption modes will require you to have a valid [origin certificate](/ssl/concepts/#origin-certificate), which is managed on your origin server. Each encryption mode setup page lists out this and other requirements and you can also [consider other Cloudflare options to use with your origin server](/ssl/origin-configuration/), such as [Origin CA certificates](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/).
