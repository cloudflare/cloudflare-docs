## Features

<Feature header="Total TLS" href="/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/total-tls/">
Extending the protection offered by Universal SSL, Total TLS is an easy way to automatically issue certificates for all levels of subdomains that you have.
</Feature>

<Feature header="Delegated DCV" href="/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/">
Even if you use a different provider for authoritative DNS, you can delegate domain control validation (DCV) to Cloudflare, reducing the need of manual intervention.
</Feature>

<Feature header="Custom TLS settings" href="/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/minimum-tls/">
Cloudflare also allows you to specify the minimum TLS version that visitors must use to connect to your website or application, and restrict cipher suites according to your security requirements.
