Setting your encryption mode to **Off (not recommended)** redirects any HTTPS request to plaintext HTTP.

        accTitle: No SSL/TLS Encryption
        accDescr: With an encryption mode of Off, your application does not encrypt traffic between the visitor and Cloudflare or between Cloudflare and your server.
        A[Browser] <--Unencrypted--> B((Cloudflare))<--Unencrypted--> C[(Origin server)]
```

## Use when

Cloudflare does not recommend setting your encryption mode to **Off**.

## Required setup

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="change-encryption-mode-dash" />

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="change-encryption-mode-api" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Limitations

When you set your encryption mode to **Off**, your application:

* Leaves your visitors and your application [vulnerable to attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-use-https/).
* Will be marked as "not secure" by Chrome and other browsers, reducing visitor trust.
* Will be penalized in [SEO rankings](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html).

### Incompatible settings

When you set your SSL/TLS encryption mode to **Off**, you will not see the options for [**Always Use HTTPS**](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https/) or [**Onion Routing**](/network/onion-routing/).
