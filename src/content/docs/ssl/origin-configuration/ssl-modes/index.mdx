  your origin web server and how certificates presented by your origin are
  validated.

If possible, Cloudflare strongly recommends using [**Full**](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [**Full (strict)**](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) modes to prevent malicious connections to your origin.

For more details on how encryption modes fit into the bigger picture of Cloudflare SSL/TLS protection, refer to [Concepts](/ssl/concepts/#ssltls-certificate).

## Available encryption modes

[Automatic SSL/TLS](#automatic-ssltls-default) uses the SSL/TLS Recommender to make the determination as to what encryption mode is the most secure and safest for a website to be set to. If there is a more secure option for your website (based on your origin certification or capabilities), Automatic SSL/TLS will find it and apply it for your domain. The other option, [Custom SSL/TLS](#custom-ssltls), will work exactly like the setting the encryption mode does today.

:::note
We are gradually rolling out the new [Automated SSL/TLS feature](#automatic-ssltls-default).

If your zone has not been migrated yet, you will only have [Custom SSL/TLS](#custom-ssltls) options in your dashboard.
:::

To understand how the various encryption modes affect your cache, refer to the section on [Impact of SSL setting on cache behavior](/cache/how-to/cache-keys/#impact-of-ssl-settings-on-cache-behavior).

### Automatic SSL/TLS (default)

Automatic SSL/TLS uses the [SSL/TLS Recommender](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-tls-recommender/) to identify and apply the most secure encryption mode for your website. It continuously assesses your traffic to determine if a more secure option is needed based on your origin certification or capabilities, and updates your settings automatically to ensure the highest level of security for your domain.

:::note
Automatic SSL/TLS will not change your setting to a less secure encryption mode. For example, if your origin certificate expires, the encryption mode will not change from **Full (strict)** to **Full**. You must ensure the validity of your origin SSL configuration at all times.

Cloudflare is enabling Automatic SSL/TLS on the following dates:

| Plan           | Using SSL/TLS recommender? | Grace period ends |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Non-Enterprise | Yes                        | September 9th, 2024 |
| Enterprise     | Yes                        | October 7th, 2024   |
| All plans      | No                         | October 21st, 2024  |

#### Opt out single zone

If you want to opt a zone out via the API, you can make this API call on or before the grace period expiration date.

```bash
 curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/settings/ssl_automatic_mode \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <CF_API_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"value":"custom"}'
```

#### Opt out multiple zones

If you wanted to opt out multiple zones:

1. Create an API token with the following permissions:
   - `Zone - Zone - Read`
   - `Zone - Zone Settings - Read`
   - `Zone - Zone Settings - Edit`
2. Make a [`GET` request](/api/operations/zones-get) to get a list of zones (you can filter this list by `account.id`).

   ```bash "account.id=<ACCOUNT_ID>"
   curl 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?account.id=<ACCOUNT_ID>' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <CF_API_TOKEN>' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

3. Create a list of zone IDs you want to opt-out with each zone ID on a separate line (newline separate), stored in a file such as `zones.txt`.
4. Create a bash script for `opt-out-multiple-zones.sh` and add the following. Add `zones.txt` to the same directory or update the path accordingly.

   ```bash title="opt-out-multiple-zones.sh"
   for zoneID in $(cat zone.txt); do
     printf "Opting out ${zoneID}:\n"

     curl --request PATCH \
   		--url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$zoneID/settings/ssl_automatic_mode \
   		--header 'Authorization: Bearer <CF_API_TOKEN>' \
   		--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   		--data '{"value":"custom"}'

     printf "\n\n"
   done
   ```

5. Open your command line and run:

   ```bash
   bash opt-out-multiple-zones.sh
   ```

### Custom SSL/TLS

To use Custom SSL/TLS, select the custom option (if you prefer to manually set the encryption mode instead of using [Automatic SSL/TLS](#automatic-ssltls-default)):
