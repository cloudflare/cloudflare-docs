import { Render, TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components"

Setting your encryption mode to **Flexible** makes your site partially secure. Cloudflare allows HTTPS connections between your visitor and Cloudflare, but all connections between Cloudflare and your origin are made through HTTP. As a result, an SSL certificate is not required on your origin.

    accTitle: Flexible SSL/TLS Encryption
    accDescr: With an encryption mode of Flexible, your application encrypts traffic between the visitor and Cloudflare, but not between Cloudflare and your server.
    A[Browser] <--Encrypted--> B((Cloudflare))<--Unencrypted--> C[(Origin server)]
```

## Use when

Choose this option when you cannot set up an SSL certificate on your origin or your origin does not support SSL/TLS.

## Required setup

### Prerequisites

<Render file="ssl-mode-errors" />

### Process

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="change-encryption-mode-dash" />

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="change-encryption-mode-api" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Limitations

Flexible mode is only supported for HTTPS connections on port 443 (default port). Other ports using HTTPS will fall back to [**Full** mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/).

If your application contains sensitive information (personalized data, user login), use [**Full**](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [**Full (Strict)**](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) modes instead.
