description: Learn how to set up Cloudflare Authenticated Origin Pulls with the
  AWS Application Load Balancer.

---

This guide will walk you through how to set up [per-hostname](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/) authenticated origin pulls to securely connect to an AWS Application Load Balancer using [mutual TLS verify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/mutual-authentication.html).

You can also find instructions on how to [rollback](#rollback-the-cloudflare-configuration) this setup in Cloudflare.

## Before you begin

* You should already have your AWS account and [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?icmpid=docs_homepage_featuredsvcs) configured.
* Note that this tutorial uses command-line interface (CLI) to generate a custom certificate, and [API calls](/fundamentals/api/get-started/) to configure Cloudflare Authenticated Origin Pulls.
* For the most up-to-date documentation on how to set up AWS, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).

## 1. Generate a custom certificate

1. Run the following command to generate a 4096-bit RSA private key, using AES-256 encryption. Enter a passphrase when prompted.

```bash
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out rootca.key 4096
```

2. Create the CA root certificate. When prompted, fill in the information to be included in the certificate. For the `Common Name` field, use the domain name as value, not the hostname.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootca.key -sha256 -days 1826 -out rootca.crt
```

3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). When prompted, fill in the information to be included in the request. For the `Common Name` field, use the hostname as value.

```bash
openssl req -new -nodes -out cert.csr -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout cert.key
```

4. Sign the certificate using the `rootca.key` and `rootca.crt` created in previous steps.

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in cert.csr -CA rootca.crt -CAkey rootca.key -CAcreateserial -out cert.crt -days 730 -sha256 -extfile ./cert.v3.ext
```

5. Make sure the certificate extensions file `cert.v3.ext` specifies the following:

```
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
```

## 2. Configure AWS Application Load Balancer

1. Upload the `rootca.cert` to an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html).
2. [Create a trust store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/mutual-authentication.html#create-trust-store) at your EC2 console, indicating the **S3 URI** where you uploaded the certificate.
3. Create an EC2 instance and install an HTTPD daemon. Choose an [instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) according to your needs - it can be a minimal instance eligible to [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). This tutorial was based on an example using t2.micro and [Amazon Linux 2023](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/ug/what-is-amazon-linux.html).

```bash
sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

4. Create a [target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html#configure-target-group) for your Application Load Balancer.
   * Choose **Instances** as target type.
   * Specify port `HTTP/80`.
5. After you finish configuring the target group, confirm that the target group is [healthy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html).
6. [Configure a load balancer and a listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-application-load-balancer.html#configure-load-balancer).
   * Choose the **Internet-facing** scheme.
   * Switch the listener to port `443` so that the **mTLS** option is available, and select the target group created in previous steps.
   * For **Default SSL/TLS server certificate**, choose **Import certificate** > **Import to ACM**, and add the certificate private key and body.
   * Under **Client certificate handling**, select **Verify with trust store**.
7. Save your settings.
8. (Optional) Run the following commands to confirm that the Application Load Balancing is asking for the client certificate.

```bash
openssl s_client -verify 5 -connect <your-application-load-balancer>:443 -quiet -state
```

Since you have not yet uploaded the certificate to Cloudflare, the connection should fail (`read:errno=54`, for example).

You can also run `curl --verbose` and confirm `Request CERT (13)` is present within the SSL/TLS handshake:

```bash
curl --verbose https://<your-application-load-balancer>
...
* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS handshake, Request CERT (13):
...
```

## 3. Configure Cloudflare

1. [Upload the certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate) you created in [Step 1](#1-generate-a-custom-certificate) to Cloudflare. You should use the leaf certificate, not the root CA.

```bash
MYCERT="$(cat cert.crt|perl -pe 's/\r?\n/\\n/'|sed -e 's/..$//')"
MYKEY="$(cat cert.key|perl -pe 's/\r?\n/\\n/'|sed -e's/..$//')"

request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
"certificate": "$MYCERT",
"private_key": "$MYKEY",
"bundle_method":"ubiquitous"
}
EOF
))

# Push the certificate

curl --silent \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONEID/origin_tls_client_auth/hostnames/certificates" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: $MYAUTHEMAIL" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: $MYAUTHKEY" \
--data "$request_body"
```

2.[Associate the certificate with the hostname](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-enable-or-disable-a-hostname-for-client-authentication) that should use it.

```bash
curl --silent --request PUT \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONEID/origin_tls_client_auth/hostnames" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: $MYAUTHEMAIL" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: $MYAUTHKEY" \
--data '{
  "config": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "cert_id": "<CERT_ID>",
      "hostname": "<YOUR_HOSTNAME>"
    }
  ]
}'
```

3. [Enable the Authenticated Origin Pulls](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/#3-enable-authenticated-origin-pulls-globally) feature on your zone.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONEID/settings/tls_client_auth" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: $MYAUTHEMAIL" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: $MYAUTHKEY" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "value": "on"
}'
```

:::note

Make sure your [encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) is set to **Full** or higher. If you only want to adjust this setting for a specific hostname, use [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/settings/#ssl).

## Rollback the Cloudflare configuration

1. Use a [`PUT` request](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-enable-or-disable-a-hostname-for-client-authentication) to disable Authenticated Origin Pulls on the hostname.

```bash
curl -s --request PUT \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONEID/origin_tls_client_auth/hostnames" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: $MYAUTHEMAIL" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: $MYAUTHKEY" \
--data '{
  "config": [
    {
      "enabled": false,
      "cert_id": "<CERT_ID>",
      "hostname": "<YOUR_HOSTNAME>"
    }
  ]
}'
```

2. (Optional) Use a [`GET` request](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-list-certificates) to obtain a list of the client certificate IDs. You will need the ID of the certificate you want to remove for the following step.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONEID/origin_tls_client_auth/hostnames/certificates" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: $MYAUTHEMAIL" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: $MYAUTHKEY"
```

3. Use the [Delete hostname client certificate](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-delete-hostname-client-certificate) endpoint to remove the certificate you had uploaded.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONEID/origin_tls_client_auth/hostnames/certificates/$CERTID" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: $MYAUTHEMAIL" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: $MYAUTHKEY"
```
