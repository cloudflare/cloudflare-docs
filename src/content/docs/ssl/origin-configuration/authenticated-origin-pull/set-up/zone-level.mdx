import { AvailableNotifications, Render } from "~/components"

When you enable Authenticated Origin Pulls (AOP) for a zone, all proxied traffic to your zone is authenticated at the origin web server.

## Before you begin

Make sure your zone is using an [SSL/TLS encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) of **Full** or higher.

:::caution

Zone-level AOP certificates are also applied to [custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/) configured on a Cloudflare for SaaS zone.
If you need a different AOP certificate to apply to different custom hostnames, use [Per-hostname AOP](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/).

:::

## 1. Upload certificate to origin

First, upload a certificate to your origin.

To use a Cloudflare certificate (which uses a specific CA), [download the .PEM file](/ssl/static/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem) and upload it to your origin. This certificate is **not** the same as the Cloudflare Origin CA certificate and will not appear on your Dashboard.

To use a custom certificate, follow the API instructions to [upload a custom certificate to Cloudflare](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate), but use the [`origin_tls_client_auth` endpoint](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-upload-certificate). Then, upload the certificate to your origin.

:::caution


Although Cloudflare provides you a certificate to easily configure zone-level authenticated origin pulls, this certificate is not exclusive to your account and only guarantees that a request is coming from the Cloudflare network. If you want more strict security, you should upload your own certificate.

Using a custom certificate is required if you need your domain to be [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) compliant.

## 2. Configure origin to accept client certificates

<Render file="aop-configure-origin" params={{ one: "To use the Cloudflare certificate, download it from step 1 above, rename the .PEM file, and then upload it to `/path/to/origin-pull-ca.pem` before applying the settings.", two: " To use the Cloudflare certificate, download it from step 1 above, rename the .PEM file, and then upload it to `/etc/nginx/certs/cloudflare.crt` before applying the settings." }} />

## 3. Configure Cloudflare to use client certificate

<Render file="aop-enable-feature" />

## 4. Enable Authenticated Origin Pulls for all hostnames in a zone

Use the Cloudflare API to send a [`PUT`](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-set-enablement-for-zone) request to enable zone-level authenticated origin pulls.

If you had set up logging on your origin during [step 2](#2-configure-origin-to-accept-client-certificates), test and confirm that Authenticated Origin Pulls is working.

## 5. Enforce validation check on your origin

<Render file="aop-enforce-validation" />

## 6. (Optional) Set up alerts for zone-level Authenticated Origin Pulls certificates

You can configure alerts to receive notifications before your AOP certificates expire.

<AvailableNotifications product="SSL/TLS" notificationFilter="Zone-level Authenticated Origin Pulls Certificate Expiration Alert" />

<Render file="get-started" product="notifications" />
