    content: Set up Authenticated Origin Pulls

---

Refer to the following sections to learn how to manage certificates used with the different Authenticated Origin Pulls setups.

## Use specialized certificates

To apply different client certificates simultaneously at both the zone and hostname level, you can combine zone-level and per-hostname custom certificates.

First set up [zone-level pulls](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/zone-level/) using a certificate. Then, upload multiple, specialized certificates for [individual hostnames](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/).

:::note[Note]


Since per-hostname certificates are more specific, they take precedence over zone certificates.

## Delete a certificate

Client certificates are not deleted from Cloudflare upon expiration unless a [delete](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-delete-certificate) or [replace](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-upload-certificate) request is sent to the Cloudflare API.

However, requests are dropped at your origin if your origin only accepts a valid client certificate.

## Replace a client cert (without downtime)

For hostname:

1. [Upload the new certificate](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-upload-a-hostname-client-certificate).

2. [Enable Authenticated Origin Pulls for that specific hostname](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-enable-or-disable-a-hostname-for-client-authentication).

For global:

1. [Upload the new certificate](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-upload-certificate).

2. [Check whether new certificate is Active](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-get-certificate-details).

3. Once certificate is active, [delete the previous certificate](/api/operations/zone-level-authenticated-origin-pulls-delete-certificate).
