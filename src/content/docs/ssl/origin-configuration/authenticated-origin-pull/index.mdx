Authenticated Origin Pulls (AOP) helps ensure requests to your origin server come from the Cloudflare network, which provides an additional layer of security on top of [Full](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [Full (strict)](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) encryption modes.

This authentication becomes particularly important with the [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/waf/). Together with the WAF, you can make sure that **all traffic** is evaluated before receiving a response from your origin server.

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="ssl.authenticated_origin_pulls" />

## Aspects to consider

Although Cloudflare provides you a certificate to easily [configure zone-level authenticated origin pulls](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/zone-level/), this certificate is not exclusive to your account and only guarantees that a request is coming from the Cloudflare network. If you want more strict security, you should consider [additional security measures for your origin](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/protect-your-origin-server/) and upload your own certificate when setting up Authenticated Origin Pulls.

Using a custom certificate is possible with both [zone-level](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/zone-level/) and [per-hostname](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/) authenticated origin pulls and is required if you need your domain to be [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) compliant.

## Limitations

Authenticated Origin Pulls does not apply when your [SSL/TLS encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) is set to **Off** or **Flexible**.
