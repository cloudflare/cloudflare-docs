import { Render, TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components"

:::note


Geo Key Manager v2 is only available through the Cloudflare API.


:::

Geo Key Manager v2 gives customers flexibility when choosing the geographical boundaries of where their keys are stored.

Using the `policy` field, customers can define policies containing allow and block lists of countries or regions where the private key should be stored.

To use Geo Key Manager v2 with the API, generally, follow the steps to [upload a custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate).

When sending the [`POST`](/api/operations/custom-ssl-for-a-zone-create-ssl-configuration) request, include the `policy` parameter to define policies containing allow and block lists of countries or regions where the private key should be stored.

:::note


You also have access to the `geo_restrictions` parameter, which is mutually exclusive with the `policy` parameter and is part of [Geo Key Manager v1](#geo-key-manager-v1).


:::

### Examples

```bash title="Store private keys in the E.U. and the U.S."
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/custom_certificates" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "certificate":"certificate",
  "private_key":"<PRIVATE_KEY>",
  "policy":"(country: US) and (region: EU)",
  "type": "sni_custom"
}'
```

```bash title="Store private keys in the E.U., but not in France"
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/custom_certificates" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "certificate":"certificate",
  "private_key":"<PRIVATE_KEY>",
  "policy":"(region: EU) and (not country: FR)",
  "type": "sni_custom"
}'
```

:::note


For more information on the `policy` field, refer to [Supported options](/ssl/edge-certificates/geokey-manager/supported-options/).
