title: Opportunistic Encryption

Opportunistic Encryption allows browsers to access HTTP URIs over an encrypted TLS channel. It's not a substitute for HTTPS, but provides additional security for otherwise vulnerable requests.

Use HTTPS when both strong encryption and authentication are required. HTTP Opportunistic Encryption provides a means of enabling TLS when needed for other protocols such as HTTP/2. It does not provide the same indications of security as HTTPS (the green lock icon in most browser address bars).

## Enable Opportunistic Encryption

You do not need to configure your origin web server to support Opportunistic Encryption. All it requires is updating your settings in the Cloudflare dashboard.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="dashboard">

To enable Opportunistic Encryption in the dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and go to a specific domain.
2. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
3. For **Opportunistic Encryption**, switch the toggle to **On**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

To adjust your Opportunistic Encryption settings with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) request with `opportunistic_encryption` as the setting name in the URI path, and specify the `value` parameter with your desired setting (`"on"` or `"off"`).
