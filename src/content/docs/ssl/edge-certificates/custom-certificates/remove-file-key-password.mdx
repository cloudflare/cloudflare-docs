You cannot upload a custom certificate with a password-protected key file.

The process for removing the password depends on your operating system. The following examples remove the password from `example.com.key`.

1. Open a command console.

2. Go to the directory containing the `example.com.key` file.

3. Copy the original key.

   ```sh
   cp example.com.key temp.key
   ```

4. Run the following command (if using an ECDSA certificate, replace `rsa` with `ec`).

   ```sh
   openssl rsa -in temp.key -out example.com.key
   ```

5. When prompted in the console window, enter the original key password.
