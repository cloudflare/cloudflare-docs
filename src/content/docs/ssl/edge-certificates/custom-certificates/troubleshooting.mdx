## Generic troubleshooting

### Make sure your key and certificate match

You can use an external tool such as the [SSLShopper Certificate Key Matcher](https://www.sslshopper.com/certificate-key-matcher.html) to check your certificate and make sure the key matches.

### Check the certificate details

You can use `openssl` to check all the details of your certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -noout -text
```

Then, make sure all the information is correct before uploading.

## Let's Encrypt chain update

As Let's Encrypt - one of the [certificate authorities (CAs)](/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/) used by Cloudflare - has announced changes in its [chain of trust](/ssl/concepts/#chain-of-trust), you may face issues.

If you are using a Let's Encrypt certificate uploaded by yourself as a custom certificate, consider the following:

- If you use **compatible** or **modern** [bundle method](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/bundling-methodologies/) and have uploaded your certificate before September 9, 2024, [update your custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#update-an-existing-custom-certificate) so that it can be bundled with the new chain.
- If you use **user-defined** bundle method, make sure that your certificates uploaded after September 30, 2024, do not use the Let's Encrypt cross-signed chain. For details, refer to the [full migration guide](/ssl/reference/migration-guides/lets-encrypt-chain/).

## Error codes

### Invalid certificate. (Code: 1002)

**Root cause**

The certificate you are trying to upload is invalid. For example, there might be extra lines, or the BEGIN/END text is not correct, or extra characters are added following a copy/paste.

**Solution**

Carefully check the content of the certificate. You may use `openssl` to check all the details of your certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -noout -text
```

### You have reached the maximum number of custom certificates. (Code: 1212)

**Root cause**

You have used up your custom certificate quota.

**Solution**

Delete some existing certificates to add a new one. If you are an Enterprise customer, you can contact your account team to acquire more custom certificates.

### This certificate has already been submitted. (Code: 1220)

**Root cause**

You are trying to upload a custom certificate that you have already uploaded.

**Solution**

Delete the existing one and try again.

### The SSL attribute is invalid. Please refer to the API documentation, check your input and try again. (Code: 1434)

**Root cause**

You are trying to upload a custom certificate that does not support any cipher that is needed by Chromium-based browsers.

**Solution**

Modify the certificate so that it supports chromium-supported ciphers and try again.

### You have reached your quota for the requested resource. (Code: 2005)

**Root cause**

The quota for custom certificates depends on the **type** of certificate (**Custom Legacy** vs **Custom Modern**).

If you try to upload a certificate **type** but have already reached your quota, you will receive this error.

**Solution**

First, check your custom certificate entitlements at **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.

Then, when actually uploading or editing the certificate, make sure you select the appropriate option for **Legacy Client Support**.

### The certificate chain you uploaded cannot be bundled using Cloudflare's trust store. Please check your input and try again. (Code: 2100)

**Root cause**

You are trying to upload a custom certificate that contains the root and leaf certificate at the same time.

**Solution**

Upload the leaf certificate only.

### The certificate chain you uploaded has no leaf certificates. Please check your input and try again. (Code: 2101)

**Root cause**

You are trying to upload a root + intermediate + intermediate `.crt` file, but the actual leaf certificate is in a separate file.

**Solution**

Add the leaf to the `.crt` file, or just use the leaf by itself since the Certificate Authority has a public chain of trust in our trust store.

### The certificate chain you uploaded does not include any hostnames from your zone. Please check your input and try again. (Code: 2103)

**Root cause**

Cloudflare verifies that uploaded custom certificates include a hostname for the associated zone. Moreover, this hostname must be included as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This is following the standard set by the [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/BRv1.2.5.pdf#page=16).

**Solution**

Make sure your certificate contains a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) specifying a hostname in your zone. You can use the `openssl` command below and look for `Subject Alternative Name` in the output.

```bash
openssl x509 -in certificateFile.pem -noout -text
```

If it does not exist, you will need to request a new certificate.

### The private key you uploaded is invalid. Please check your input and try again. (Code: 2106)

**Root cause**

Cloudflare requires separate, pem-encoded files for the SSL private key and certificate.

**Solution**

Contact your Certificate Authority (CA) to confirm whether your current certificate meets this requirement or request your CA to assist with certificate format conversion.

Make sure your certificate complies with these [requirements](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#certificate-requirements).

Check that the certificate and private keys match before uploading the certificate in the Cloudflare dashboard. This [external resource](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html) might help.
