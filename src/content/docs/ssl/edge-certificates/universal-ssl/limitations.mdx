import { GlossaryTooltip } from "~/components"

Universal SSL certificates are limited by the hostnames they cover and the browsers they support.

## Hostname coverage

### Full setup

Universal SSL certificates only support SSL for the root or first-level subdomains such as `example.com` and `www.example.com`. To enable SSL support on second, third, and fourth-level subdomains such as `dev.www.example.com` or `app3.dev.www.example.com`, you can:

* Purchase [Advanced Certificate Manager](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) to order advanced certificates.
* Upgrade to a Business or Enterprise plan to [upload custom certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/).

### CNAME setup

On a CNAME setup zone, each subdomain has its own Universal SSL certificate and does not require additional features or purchases.

## Browser support

For more on browser support, see [Browser compatibility](/ssl/reference/browser-compatibility/).

## Spectrum

Universal SSL is not compatible with [Cloudflare Spectrum](/spectrum/). If you are trying to use Spectrum, use either [an advanced certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) or [a custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/).

## Load balancing

Due to internal limitations, Universal SSL certificates do not cover [load balancing hostnames](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/) by default. This behavior will be corrected in the future.

## Certificate authority

For Universal SSL certificates, Cloudflare chooses the <GlossaryTooltip term="Certificate Authority (CA)">certificate authority (CA)</GlossaryTooltip> used for your certificate.

Cloudflare can change the [certificate authority](/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/) without prior notification, and will not send any notification as the change happens.

If you want to choose the issuing certificate authority, [order an advanced certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/).
