## Who should create CAA records?

You should [create CAA records](#create-caa-records) in Cloudflare if each of the following is true:

* You uploaded your own custom origin server certificate (not provisioned by Cloudflare).
* That certificate was issued by a CA (not self-signed).
* Your domain is on a full setup (not a [CNAME setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup)).
* When adding new [Custom Hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/) and your customer has existing CAA records. In this case, ask your customer to remove the existing CAA records or add the missing CAA record.
