:::note


With the [upcoming change](/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/advanced-certificates/) to certificates issued by DigiCert, email DCV will soon be unsupported.


:::

## Limitations

Based on your chosen Certificate Authority, you may not be able to use email verification with [advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/).

## Setup

### Specify DCV method

<Render file="generic-validation-process" />

### View DCV values

Once you specify your chosen validation method, you can access the validation values by:

<Render file="generic-view-validation-status" />

Once you locate your certificate, find the following values:

* API: `emails`
* Dashboard: **Certificate validation email recipients**.

### Complete DCV

<Render file="email-validation-process" />

## Renewal

<Render file="dcv-certificate-renewal" />

If any one of the conditions is not met, the certificate renewal falls back to your chosen method and you will need to repeat the DCV process manually.
