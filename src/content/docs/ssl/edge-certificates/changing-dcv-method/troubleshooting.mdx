Taking into account the [steps involved in DCV](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/dcv-flow/), some situations may interfere with certificate issuance and renewal.

[Blocked validation URLs](#blocked-validation-url) or [misconfigured DNS settings](#dns-settings-and-records) might interfere with the <GlossaryTooltip term="Certificate Authority (CA)">certificate authority's</GlossaryTooltip> ability to finish the validation process. In these situations, you may need to update your configuration at Cloudflare or at your authoritative DNS provider. Additionally, there can also be [errors on the CA side](#ca-errors).

:::note

If you are using the Cloudflare API, error messages are presented under the `validation_errors` parameter. 
:::

## Blocked validation URL

If you have issues while HTTP DCV is in place, review the following settings:

* **Anything affecting `/.well-known/*`**: Review [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/), [IP Access Rules](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/), and other [configuration rules](/rules/configuration-rules/) to make sure that your rules *do not* enable interactive challenge on the validation URL.

* **Cloudflare Account Settings** and **Page Rules**: Review your [account settings](/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/), [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/), and [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/) to ensure you have not enabled **I'm Under Attack Mode** on the validation URL.

## Redirection

Enabling [Always Use HTTPS](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https/) does not impact the validation process.

In a [Partial (CNAME) setup](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/#partial-dns-setup---action-sometimes-required) where you are managing the token on the origin side, please ensure that no redirection from HTTP to HTTPS occurs on the `/.well-known/*` path.

When using [Redirect Rules](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/) the `/.well-known/*` path should be excluded from redirections.


## DNS settings and records

The errors below refer to situations that have to be addressed at the authoritative DNS provider:

* `the Certificate Authority had trouble performing a DNS lookup: dns problem: looking up caa for nsheiapp.codeacloud.com: dnssec: bogus`
* `Certificate authority encountered a SERVFAIL during DNS lookup, please check your DNS reachability.`

Consider the following when troubleshooting:

* [DNSSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-security/) must be configured correctly. You can use [DNSViz](https://dnsviz.net/) to understand and troubleshoot the deployment of DNSSEC.
* Your [CAA records](/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/) should allow Cloudflare's partner [certificate authorities (CAs)](/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/) to issue certificates on your behalf.
* The HTTP verification process is done preferably over **IPv6**, so if any `AAAA` record exists and does not point to the same dual-stack location as the `A` record, the validation will fail.

## CA errors

### Rate limiting

<Render file="error-rate-limiting" />

### Internal errors

When the certificate authority finds an issue during the CA check portion of the [DCV flow](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/dcv-flow/), you may see a `Internal error with Certificate Authority` message. In this case, either wait or try a different certificate authority.

When the error states that the `certificate authority will not issue for this domain`, you can try a different certificate authority or contact the CA directly.
