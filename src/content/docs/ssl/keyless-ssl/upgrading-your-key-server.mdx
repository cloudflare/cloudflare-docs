Periodically, you may need to update your key server when using Cloudflare's Keyless SSL.

To upgrade your key server:

1. Back up the contents of `/etc/keyless`.
2. Update your OS’ package listings, for example, `apt-get update` or `yum update`.
3. Upgrade the gokeyless server:
4. Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get upgrade gokeyless`
5. RHEL/CentOS: `yum install gokeyless`
6. Restart the keyless instance:
7. systemd: `service gokeyless restart`
8. upstart/sysvinit: `/etc/init.d/gokeyless restart`
9. Confirm that HTTPS connections are working as expected.

:::caution


If you are running a [high availability configuration](/ssl/keyless-ssl/reference/high-availability/), upgrade one server at a time as new TLS connections will fail to terminate at Cloudflare's global network without a functioning key server.
