title: Google Cloud HSM
---

This tutorial uses [Google Cloud HSM](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/hsm) — a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified implementation.

---

## Before you start

Make sure that you have:

- Set up your [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/quickstart#before-you-begin)

---

## 1. Create a key ring

To set up the Google Cloud HSM, [create a key ring](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/hsm#kms-create-key-hsm-web) and indicate its location.

:::note[Note:]

Only [certain locations](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations#hsm-regions) support Google Cloud HSM.

## 2. Create a key

Create a key, including the following information:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th width="25%">Field</th>
			<th width="25%">Value</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Key ring</td>
			<td>
				The key ring you created in <b>Step 2</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Protection level</td>
			<td>HSM</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Purpose</td>
			<td>Asymmetric Encrypt</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

---

## 3. Import the private key

After creating a key ring and key, [import the private key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/importing-a-key).

:::note[Note:]

You need to [convert your key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/formatting-keys-for-import#formatting_asymmetric_keys) from a PEM to DER format.

:::

---

## 4. Modify your gokeyless config file and restart the service

Once you’ve imported the key, copy the **Resource name** from the UI. Then, add this value to the `gokeyless` YAML file under `private_key_stores`.

With the config file saved, restart `gokeyless` and verify it started successfully.

```sh
sudo systemctl restart gokeyless.service
sudo systemctl status gokeyless.service -l
```
