You can use Cloudfare Keyless SSL with [Fortanix Data Security Manager (DSM)](https://www.fortanix.com/platform/data-security-manager), a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified implementation.

You must have a [Data Security Manager Enterprise Tier](https://www.fortanix.com/start-your-free-trial) and set up a group and an application assigned to the group.

For detailed guidance, follow the tutorial in the [Fortanix documentation](https://support.fortanix.com/docs/fortanix-data-security-manager-with-cloudflare-integration#50-configure-fortanix-dsm). This guide is based on the Keyless SSL [public DNS](/ssl/keyless-ssl/configuration/public-dns/) option and has been tested using a virtual machine (VM) deployed to Azure running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.
