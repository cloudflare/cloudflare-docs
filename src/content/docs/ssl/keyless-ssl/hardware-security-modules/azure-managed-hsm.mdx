title: Azure Managed HSM
---

This tutorial uses [Microsoft Azure’s Managed HSM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/akv-managed-hsm-public-preview/) — a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified implementation — to deploy a VM with the Keyless SSL daemon.

---

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- Followed Microsoft's [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/quick-create-cli) for provisioning and activating the managed HSM
- Set up a VM for your key server

---

## 1. Create a VM

Create a VM where you will deploy the keyless daemon.

---

## 2. Deploy the keyless server

Follow [these instructions](/ssl/keyless-ssl/configuration/cloudflare-tunnel/#4-set-up-and-activate-key-server) to deploy your keyless server.

---

## 3. Set up the Azure CLI

Set up the Azure CLI (used to access the private key).

For example, if you were using macOS:

```
brew install azure-cli
```

---

## 4. Set up the Managed HSM

1. Log in through the Azure CLI and create a resource group for the Managed HSM in one of the supported regions:

   ```sh
   az login
   az group create --name HSMgroup --location southcentralus
   ```

   :::note
   For a list of supported regions, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=key-vault).
   :::

2. [Create, provision, and activate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/quick-create-cli) the HSM.

3. Add your private key to the `keyvault`, which returns the URI you need for **Step 4**:

   ```
   az keyvault key import --hsm-name "KeylessHSM" --name "hsm-pub-keyless" --pem-file server.key
   ```

4. If the key server is running in an Azure VM in the same account, use **Managed services** for authorization:

   1. Enable managed services on the VM in the UI.
   2. Give your service user (associated with your VM) HSM sign permissions

      ```
      az keyvault role assignment create  --hsm-name KeylessHSM --assignee $(az vm identity show --name "hsmtestvm" --resource-group "HSMgroup" --query principalId -o tsv) --scope / --role "Managed HSM Crypto User"
      ```

5. In the `gokeyless` YAML file, add the URI from **Step 2** under `private_key_stores`. See our [README](https://github.com/cloudflare/gokeyless/blob/master/README.md) for an example.

## 5. Restart gokeyless

Once you save the config file, restart `gokeyless` and verify that it started successfully:

```
sudo systemctl restart gokeyless.service
sudo systemctl status gokeyless.service -l
```
