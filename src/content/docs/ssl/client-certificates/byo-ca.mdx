  Cloudflare mTLS.

This page explains how you can manage mTLS using client certificates that have not been issued by Cloudflare CA.

This is especially useful if you already have mTLS implemented and client certificates are already installed on devices.

## Availability

* Currently, you can only manage your uploaded CA via API, and the hostname associations are **not** reflected on the [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/client-certificates/).
* This process is only available on Enterprise accounts.
* Each Enterprise account can upload up to five CAs. This quota does not apply to CAs uploaded through [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/).

## CA certificate requirements

<Render file="byo-ca-mtls-cert-requirements" /><br />

## Set up mTLS with your CA

1. Use the [Upload mTLS certificate endpoint](/api/operations/m-tls-certificate-management-upload-m-tls-certificate) to upload the CA root certificate.



* `ca` boolean required

  * Set to `true` to indicate that the certificate is a CA certificate.

* `certificates` string required

  * Insert content from the `.pem` file associated with the CA certificate, formatted as a single string with `\n` replacing the line breaks.

* `name` string optional
  * Indicate a unique name for your CA certificate.



2. Take note of the certificate ID (`id`) that is returned in the API response.
3. Use the [Replace Hostname Associations endpoint](/api/operations/client-certificate-for-a-zone-put-hostname-associations) to enable mTLS in each hostname that should use the CA for mTLS validation. Use the following parameters:



* `hostnames` array required

  * List the hostnames that will be using the CA for client certificate validation.

    :::caution

    Submitting an empty array will remove all hostnames associations.
    :::

* `mtls_certificate_id` string required

  * Indicate the certificate ID obtained from the previous step.

    :::caution

    If no `mtls_certificate_id` is provided, the action will be performed against a Cloudflare Managed CA.
    :::



4. (Optional) Since this process is API-only, and hostnames that use your uploaded CA certificate **are not** listed on the dashboard, you can make a [GET request](/api/operations/client-certificate-for-a-zone-list-hostname-associations) with the `mtls_certificate_id` as a query parameter to confirm the hostname association.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/zone_id/certificate_authorities/hostname_associations?mtls_certificate_id={id_from_step_2}"  \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

5. Create a custom rule to enforce client certificate validation.
   You can do this [via the dashboard](/api-shield/security/mtls/configure/) or [via API](/waf/custom-rules/create-api/).

```txt
  "expression": "(http.host in {\"<HOSTNAME_1>\" \"<HOSTNAME_2>\"} and not cf.tls_client_auth.cert_verified)",
  "action": "block"
```

## Delete an uploaded CA

If you want to remove a CA that you have previously uploaded, you must first remove any hostname associations that it has.

1. Make a request to the [Replace Hostname Associations endpoint](/api/operations/client-certificate-for-a-zone-put-hostname-associations), with an empty array for `hostnames` and specifying your CA certificate ID in `mtls_certificate_id`:

```txt
  "hostnames": [],
  "mtls_certificate_id": "<CERTIFICATE_ID>"
```

2. Use the [Delete mTLS certificate endpoint](/api/operations/m-tls-certificate-management-delete-m-tls-certificate) to delete the certificate.
