You can enable mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) for any hostname.

## Enable mTLS

To enable mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) for a host from the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and application.
2. Go to **SSL** > **Client Certificates**.
3. To enable mTLS for a host, select **Edit** in the **Hosts** section of the **Client Certificates** card.
4. Enter the name of a host in your current application and press `Enter`.
5. Select **Save**.

After enabling mTLS for your host, you can enforce mTLS with [API Shield](/api-shield/security/mtls/configure/). While API Shield is **not required** to use mTLS, many teams may use mTLS to protect their APIs.
