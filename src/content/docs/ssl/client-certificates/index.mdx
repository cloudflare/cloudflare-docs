  certificates and enforce mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) encryption.

import { Render } from "~/components"

Use Cloudflare public key infrastructure (PKI) to create client certificates. Use these certificates with Cloudflare [API Shield](/api-shield/) or [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/mtls/) to enforce mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) encryption.

## API Shield

To use API Shield to protect your API or web application, you must do the following:

1. Use Cloudflare’s fully hosted public key infrastructure (PKI) to [create a client certificate](/ssl/client-certificates/create-a-client-certificate/).

2. [Configure your mobile app or IoT device](/ssl/client-certificates/configure-your-mobile-app-or-iot-device/) to use your Cloudflare-issued client certificate.

3. [Enable mTLS](/ssl/client-certificates/enable-mtls/) for the hosts you wish to protect with API Shield.

4. Create WAF custom rules that [require API requests to present a valid client certificate](/api-shield/security/mtls/configure/).

## Workers

To authenticate Workers requests using mTLS:

1. Use Cloudflare’s fully hosted public key infrastructure (PKI) to [create a client certificate](/ssl/client-certificates/create-a-client-certificate/).
2. Create and use an [mTLS binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/mtls/) to authenticate Workers connections.
