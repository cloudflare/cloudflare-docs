To create a client certificate in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and application.
2. Go to **SSL** > **Client Certificates**.
3. Select **Create Certificate**.

    :::caution

    By default, client certificates are issued by a Cloudflare Managed CA. Cloudflare generates a unique CA for each account.

    If you need to use certificates issued by another CA, use the API to [bring your own CA for mTLS](/ssl/client-certificates/byo-ca/). 
    :::

4. For **Private key type**, select a value.

5. For **Certificate Validity**, select a value. The default value is 10 years.

6. Select **Create**.

7. To copy the certificate or private key to your clipboard, use the **click to copy** link.

8. To close the dialog, select **OK**.

## Next steps

You can now use the client certificate for multiple things, including:

* Adding an mTLS certificate binding to your [Worker](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/mtls/).
* Embedding a certificate in your [mobile app or IoT device](/ssl/client-certificates/configure-your-mobile-app-or-iot-device/).
