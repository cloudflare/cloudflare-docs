Learn how the location of data stored in D1 is determined, including where the leader is placed and how you optimize that location based on your needs.

## Automatic (recommended)

By default, D1 will automatically create your database in a location close to where you issued the request to create a database. In most cases this allows D1 to choose the optimal location for your database on your behalf.

## Provide a location hint

Location hint is an optional parameter you can provide to indicate your desired geographical location for your database.

You may want to explicitly provide a location hint in cases where the majority of your writes to a specific database come from a different location than where you are creating the database from. location hints can be useful when:

- Working in a distributed team.
- Creating databases specific to users in specific locations.
- Using continuous deployment (CD) or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) systems to programmatically create your databases.

Provide a location hint when creating a D1 database when:

- Using [`wrangler d1`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#d1) to create a database.
- Creating a database [via the Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/d1).

:::caution
Providing a location hint does not guarantee that D1 runs in your preferred location. Instead, it will run in the nearest possible location (by latency) to your preference.

### Use Wrangler

:::note

To install Wrangler, the command-line interface for D1 and Workers, refer to [Install and Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

:::

To provide a location hint when creating a new database, pass the `--location` flag with a valid location hint:

```sh
wrangler d1 create new-database --location=weur
```

### Use the dashboard

To provide a location hint when creating a database via the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to [**Workers & Pages** > **D1**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/d1).
3. Select **Create database**.
4. Provide a database name and an optional **Location**.
5. Select **Create** to create your database.

## Available location hints

D1 supports the following location hints:

| Hint | Hint description      |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| wnam | Western North America |
| enam | Eastern North America |
| weur | Western Europe        |
| eeur | Eastern Europe        |
| apac | Asia-Pacific          |
| oc   | Oceania               |

:::caution
D1 location hints are not currently supported for South America (`sam`), Africa (`afr`), and the Middle East (`me`). D1 databases do not run in these locations.
