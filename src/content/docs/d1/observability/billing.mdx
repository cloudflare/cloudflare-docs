D1 exposes analytics to track billing metrics (rows read, rows written, and total storage) across all databases in your account.

The metrics displayed in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are sourced from Cloudflareâ€™s [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.
