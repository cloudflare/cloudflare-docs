:::note


If you would like to explore other storage solutions for your application, Cloudflare also offers [Workers KV](/kv/api/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), and [R2](/r2/get-started/).

Refer to the [Choose a data or storage product](/workers/platform/storage-options/) to review which storage option is right for your use case.


:::

[^1]: The maximum storage per account can be increased by request on Workers Paid and Enterprise plans. See the guidance on limit increases on this page to request an increase.

[^2]: A single Worker script can have up to 1 MB of script metadata. A binding is defined as a binding to a resource, such as a D1 database, KV namespace, environmental variable or secret. Each resource binding is approximately 150-bytes, however environmental variables and secrets are controlled by the size of the value you provide. Excluding environmental variables, you can bind up to \~5,000 D1 databases to a single Worker script.

[^3]: The imported file is uploaded to R2. See [R2 upload limit](/r2/platform/limits).
