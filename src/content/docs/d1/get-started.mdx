This guide instructs you through:

- Creating your first database using D1, Cloudflare’s native serverless SQL database.
- Creating a schema and querying your database via the command-line.
- Connecting a [Cloudflare Worker](/workers/) to your D1 database to query your D1 database programmatically.

## Prerequisites

To continue:

<Steps>
1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.
2. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
3. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.
</Steps>

## 1. Create a Worker

Create a new Worker as the means to query your database.

<Steps>
1. Create a new project named `d1-tutorial` by running:

	<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="cloudflare@latest" args={"d1-tutorial"} />

	<Render
		file="c3-post-run-steps"
		product="workers"
		params={{
			one: "Hello World example",
			two: "Hello World Worker",
			three: "TypeScript",
		}}
	/>

	This creates a new `d1-tutorial` directory as illustrated below.

	<FileTree>
	- d1-tutorial
		- node_modules/
		- test/
		- src
			- **index.ts**
		- package-lock.json
		- package.json
		- testconfig.json
		- vitest.config.mts
		- worker-configuration.d.ts
		- **wrangler.toml**
	</FileTree>

	Your new `d1-tutorial` directory includes:

	- A `"Hello World"` [Worker](/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) in `index.ts`.
	- A [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file. `wrangler.toml` is how your `d1-tutorial` Worker accesses your D1 database.
</Steps>

:::note

If you are familiar with Cloudflare Workers, or initializing projects in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, initialize a new project non-interactively by setting `CI=true` as an environmental variable when running `create cloudflare@latest`.

For example: `CI=true npm create cloudflare@latest d1-tutorial --type=simple --git --ts --deploy=false` creates a basic "Hello World" project ready to build on.

:::

## 2. Create a database

A D1 database is conceptually similar to many other databases: a database may contain one or more tables, the ability to query those tables, and optional indexes. D1 uses the familiar [SQL query language](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) (as used by SQLite).

To create your first D1 database:

<Steps>
1. Change into the directory you just created for your Workers project:

	```sh
	cd d1-tutorial
	```

2. Run the following `wrangler d1` command and give your database a name. In this tutorial, the database is named `prod-d1-tutorial`:

	```sh
	npx wrangler d1 create prod-d1-tutorial
	```

	```sh output

	✅ Successfully created DB 'prod-d1-tutorial'

	[[d1_databases]]
	binding = "DB" # available in your Worker on env.DB
	database_name = "prod-d1-tutorial"
	database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
	```

</Steps>

This creates a new D1 database and outputs the [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) configuration needed in the next step.

:::note

The `wrangler` command-line interface is Cloudflare's tool for managing and deploying Workers applications and D1 databases in your terminal. It was installed when you used `npm create cloudflare@latest` to initialize your new project.

:::

:::note

For reference, a good database name is:

- A combination of ASCII characters, shorter than 32 characters, and uses dashes (-) instead of spaces.
- Descriptive of the use-case and environment. For example, "staging-db-web" or "production-db-backend".
- Only describes the database, and is not directly referenced in code.

:::

## 3. Bind your Worker to your D1 database

You must create a binding for your Worker to connect to your D1 database. [Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to access resources, like D1, on the Cloudflare developer platform. You create bindings by updating your `wrangler.toml` file.

To bind your D1 database to your Worker:

<Steps>
1. Copy the lines obtained from [step 2](/d1/get-started/#2-create-a-database) from your terminal.
2. Add them to the end of your `wrangler.toml` file.

	```toml
	[[d1_databases]]
	binding = "DB" # available in your Worker on env.DB
	database_name = "prod-d1-tutorial"
	database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
	```

	Specifically:

	- The value (string) you set for `binding` is the **binding name**, and is used to reference this database in your Worker. In this tutorial, name your binding `DB`.
	- The binding name must be [a valid JavaScript variable name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variables). For example, `binding = "MY_DB"` or `binding = "productionDB"` would both be valid names for the binding.
	- Your binding is available in your Worker at `env.<BINDING_NAME>` and the D1 [client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) is exposed on this binding.

</Steps>

:::note

When you execute the `wrangler d1 create` command, the client API package (which implements the D1 API and database class) is automatically installed. For more information on the D1 Client API, refer to [D1 Client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/).

:::

You can also bind your D1 database to a [Pages Function](/pages/functions/). For more information, refer to [Functions Bindings for D1](/pages/functions/bindings/#d1-databases).

## 4. Run a query against your D1 database

### Configure your D1 database

With `wrangler.toml` configured properly, set up your database. Use the example `schema.sql` file below to initialize your database.

<Steps>
1. Copy the following code and save it as a `schema.sql` file in the `d1-tutorial` Worker directory you created in step 1:

	```sql
	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Customers;
	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Customers (CustomerId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CompanyName TEXT, ContactName TEXT);
	INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CompanyName, ContactName) VALUES (1, 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders'), (4, 'Around the Horn', 'Thomas Hardy'), (11, 'Bs Beverages', 'Victoria Ashworth'), (13, 'Bs Beverages', 'Random Name');
	```

2. Initialize your database to run and test locally first. Bootstrap your new D1 database by running:

	```sh
	npx wrangler d1 execute prod-d1-tutorial --local --file=./schema.sql
	```

3. Validate your data is in your database by running:

	```sh
	npx wrangler d1 execute prod-d1-tutorial --local --command="SELECT * FROM Customers"
	```

	```sh output
	🌀 Mapping SQL input into an array of statements
	🌀 Executing on local database production-db-backend (5f092302-3fbd-4247-a873-bf1afc5150b) from .wrangler/state/v3/d1:
	┌────────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────────┐
	│ CustomerId │ CompanyName         │ ContactName       │
	├────────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────────┤
	│ 1          │ Alfreds Futterkiste │ Maria Anders      │
	├────────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────────┤
	│ 4          │ Around the Horn     │ Thomas Hardy      │
	├────────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────────┤
	│ 11         │ Bs Beverages        │ Victoria Ashworth │
	├────────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────────┤
	│ 13         │ Bs Beverages        │ Random Name       │
	└────────────┴─────────────────────┴───────────────────┘
	```

</Steps>

### Write queries within your Worker

After you have set up your database, run an SQL query from within your Worker.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your `d1-tutorial` Worker and open the `index.ts` file. The `index.ts` file is where you configure your Worker's interactions with D1.
2. Clear the content of `index.ts`.
3. Paste the following code snippet into your `index.ts` file:

	```typescript
	export interface Env {
		// If you set another name in wrangler.toml as the value for 'binding',
		// replace "DB" with the variable name you defined.
		DB: D1Database;
	}

	export default {
		async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
			const { pathname } = new URL(request.url);

			if (pathname === "/api/beverages") {
				// If you did not use `DB` as your binding name, change it here
				const { results } = await env.DB.prepare(
					"SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CompanyName = ?",
				)
					.bind("Bs Beverages")
					.all();
				return Response.json(results);
			}

			return new Response(
				"Call /api/beverages to see everyone who works at Bs Beverages",
			);
		},
	} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
	```

	In the code above, you:

	1. Define a binding to your D1 database in your TypeScript code. This binding matches the `binding` value you set in `wrangler.toml` under `[[d1_databases]]`.
	2. Query your database using `env.DB.prepare` to issue a [prepared query](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) with a placeholder (the `?` in the query).
	3. Call `bind()` to safely and securely bind a value to that placeholder. In a real application, you would allow a user to define the `CompanyName` they want to list results for. Using `bind()` prevents users from executing arbitrary SQL (known as "SQL injection") against your application and deleting or otherwise modifying your database.
	4. Execute the query by calling `all()` to return all rows (or none, if the query returns none).
	5. Return your query results, if any, in JSON format with `Response.json(results)`.

</Steps>

After configuring your Worker, you can test your project locally before you deploy globally.

## 5. Develop locally with Wrangler

While in your project directory, test your database locally.

<Steps>
1. Run `wrangler dev`:

	```sh
	npx wrangler dev
	```

	When you run `wrangler dev`, Wrangler provides a URL (most likely `localhost:8787`) to review your Worker.

2. Navigate to the URL.

	The page displays `Call /api/beverages to see everyone who works at Bs Beverages`.

3. Test your database is running successfully. Add `/api/beverages` to the provided Wrangler URL. For example, `localhost:8787/api/beverages`.
</Steps>

If successful, the browser displays your data.

## 6. Deploy your database

To deploy your Worker to production, you must first repeat the [database bootstrapping](/d1/get-started/#configure-your-d1-database) steps after replacing the `--local` flag with the `--remote` flag to give your Worker data to read. This creates the database tables and imports the data into the production version of your database, running on Cloudflare's global network.

<Steps>
1. Bootstrap your database with the `schema.sql` file you created in step 4:

	```sh
	npx wrangler d1 execute prod-d1-tutorial --remote --file=./schema.sql
	```

2. Validate the data is in production by running:

	```sh
	npx wrangler d1 execute prod-d1-tutorial --remote --command="SELECT * FROM Customers"
	```

3. Deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. Run:

	```sh
	npx wrangler deploy
	```

	```sh output
	Outputs: https://d1-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
	```
</Steps>

You can now visit the URL for your newly created project to query your live database.

For example, if the URL of your new Worker is `d1-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, accessing `https://d1-tutorial.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/api/beverages` sends a request to your Worker that queries your live database directly.

## 7. (Optional) Delete your database

To delete your database, run:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 delete prod-d1-tutorial
```

If you want to delete your Worker, run:

```sh
npx wrangler delete d1-tutorial
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, you have:

- Created a D1 database
- Created a Worker to access that database
- Deployed your project globally
