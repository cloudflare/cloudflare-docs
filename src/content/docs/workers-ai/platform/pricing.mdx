:::note


Workers AI has deprecated the usage of neurons in favor of unit-based pricing. The Cloudflare dashboards will be migrated this unit-based pricing soon so you can track your usage. Individual model pages will soon document the price for each model. We also made pricing cheaper! 

We will begin billing for all models under this new pricing structure beginning November 1, 2024.


:::

Workers AI is included in both the [Free and Paid Workers plans](/workers/platform/pricing/) and is priced based on model task, model size, and units.

Individual model pages will have the pricing listed on them, but the general pricing structure across our models is laid out below.

These docs will be updated as we add new pricing for new task types in our model catalog.

## Pricing Structure

### Text Generation LLMs (incl Vision models)
Model size is measured in parameters.
Pricing is based on blended tokens (input + output).
Vision models will convert the image input into tokens for billing. Depending on size an aspect ratio, images will be charged for between 1,601 and 6,404 tokens. Most images that are more that 224 pixels wide or tall will be charged as 6,404 tokens each.

| Model Size       | Pricing                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| \<= 3B           | $0.10 per Million Tokens |
| 3.1B - 8B        | $0.15 per Million Tokens |
| 8.1B - 20B       | $0.20 per Million Tokens |
| 20.1B - 40B      | $0.50 per Million Tokens |
| 40.1B+           | $0.75 per Million Tokens |

### Embeddings
Model size is measured in parameters.
Pricing is based on input tokens.

| Model Size          | Pricing                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| \<= 150M parameters | $0.008 per Million Tokens |
| 151M+ parameters    | $0.015 per Million Tokens |

## Image Generation
Standard models are large image models such as `@cf/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`
Fast models are usually smaller image models that require fewer steps to generate an image, such as `@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-1-schnell` and `@cf/bytedance/stable-diffusion-xl-lightning`
We take the maximum of the image height and width to calculate pricing. For example, and image of 1024x768 would fall under 1024x1024 pricing.

| Image Size   | Model Type | Price                 |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| \<=256x256   | Standard   | $0.00125 per 25 steps |
| \<=256x256   | Fast       | $0.00025 per 5 steps  |
| \<=512x512   | Standard   | $0.0025 per 25 steps  |
| \<=512x512   | Fast       | $0.0005 per 5 steps   |
| \<=1024x1024 | Standard   | $0.005 per 25 steps   |
| \<=1024x1024 | Fast       | $0.001 per 5 steps    |
| \<=2048x2048 | Standard   | $0.01 per 25 steps    |
| \<=2048x2048 | Fast       | $0.002 per 5 steps    |

## Speech-to-text
Speech-to-text models like `@cf/openai/whisper` are billed on minutes of audio input.

| Price                             |
| --------------------------------- |
| $0.0039 per minute of audio input |


## Free Allocation

Our free allocation allows anyone to use Workers AI up to a certain limit per day. To use more than the free allocation, upgrade to the Workers Paid plan, where you will be charged on any usage above the free tier based on the pricing structure above.


| Model                 | Free tier size                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Text Generation - LLM | 10,000 tokens a day across any model size    |
| Embeddings            | 10,000 tokens a day across any model size    |
| Images                | Sum of 250 steps, up to 1024x1024 resolution |
| Speech-to-text        | 10 minutes of audio a day                    |

All limits reset daily at 00:00 UTC. If you exceed any one of the above limits, further operations will fail with an error.


## Archived Pricing

Workers AI was previously metered by Neurons. We deprecated this in favor of unit-based pricing on September 26, 2024. We wanted to make it simple for people to compare and contrast Workers AI with other providers, and we also generally updated pricing to be cheaper with these new units.
