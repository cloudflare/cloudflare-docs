## Workers

[Workers](/workers/) provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create new applications or augment existing ones.

To use Workers AI with Workers, you must create a Workers AI [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. You create bindings on the Cloudflare dashboard or by updating your [[Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file:

```toml
[ai]
binding = "AI" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.AI
```

## Pages Functions

[Pages Functions](/pages/functions/) allow you to build full-stack applications with Cloudflare Pages by executing code on the Cloudflare network. Functions are Workers under the hood.

To configure a Workers AI binding in your Pages Function, you must use the Cloudflare dashboard. Refer to [Workers AI bindings](/pages/functions/bindings/#workers-ai) for instructions.

## Methods

### async env.AI.run()

`async env.AI.run()` runs a model. Takes a model as the first parameter, and an object as the second parameter.

```javascript
const answer = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
	prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'",
});
```

**Parameters**

- `model` <Type text="string" /> <MetaInfo text="required" />

  - The model to run.

  **Supported options**

  - `stream` <Type text="boolean" /> <MetaInfo text="optional" />
    - Returns a stream of results as they are available.

```javascript
const answer = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
	prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'",
	stream: true,
});

return new Response(answer, {
	headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
});
```
