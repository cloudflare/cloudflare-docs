description: Deploy your first Cloudflare Workers AI project using the CLI.
---

import { Render, PackageManagers } from "~/components";

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying your first Workers AI project. You will use [Workers](/workers/), a Workers AI binding, and a large language model (LLM) to deploy your first AI-powered application on the Cloudflare global network.

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

## 1. Create a Worker project

You will create a new Worker project using the `create-cloudflare` CLI (C3). [C3](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

Create a new project named `hello-ai` by running:

<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="cloudflare@latest" args={"hello-ai"} />

Running `npm create cloudflare@latest` will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare), and lead you through setup. C3 will also install [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI.

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World Worker",
		lang: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

This will create a new `hello-ai` directory. Your new `hello-ai` directory will include:

- A `"Hello World"` [Worker](/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) at `src/index.ts`.
- A [[Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file.

Go to your application directory:

```sh
cd hello-ai
```

## 2. Connect your Worker to Workers AI

You must create an AI binding for your Worker to connect to Workers AI. [Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform.

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file:

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

</WranglerConfig>

Your binding is [available in your Worker code](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/#bindings-in-es-modules-format) on [`env.AI`](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).

{/* <!-- TODO update this once we know if we'll have it --> */}

You can also bind Workers AI to a Pages Function. For more information, refer to [Functions Bindings](/pages/functions/bindings/#workers-ai).

## 3. Run an inference task in your Worker

You are now ready to run an inference task in your Worker. In this case, you will use an LLM, [`llama-3.1-8b-instruct`](/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/), to answer a question.

Update the `index.ts` file in your `hello-ai` application directory with the following code:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
export interface Env {
	// If you set another name in wrangler.toml as the value for 'binding',
	// replace "AI" with the variable name you defined.
	AI: Ai;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
			prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
		});

		return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Up to this point, you have created an AI binding for your Worker and configured your Worker to be able to execute the Llama 2 model. You can now test your project locally before you deploy globally.

## 4. Develop locally with Wrangler

While in your project directory, test Workers AI locally by running [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev):

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

<Render file="ai-local-usage-charges" product="workers" />

You will be prompted to log in after you run the `wrangler dev`. When you run `npx wrangler dev`, Wrangler will give you a URL (most likely `localhost:8787`) to review your Worker. After you go to the URL Wrangler provides, a message will render that resembles the following example:

```json
{
	"response": "Ah, a most excellent question, my dear human friend! *adjusts glasses*\n\nThe origin of the phrase \"Hello, World\" is a fascinating tale that spans several decades and multiple disciplines. It all began in the early days of computer programming, when a young man named Brian Kernighan was tasked with writing a simple program to demonstrate the basics of a new programming language called C.\nKernighan, a renowned computer scientist and author, was working at Bell Labs in the late 1970s when he created the program. He wanted to showcase the language's simplicity and versatility, so he wrote a basic \"Hello, World!\" program that printed the familiar greeting to the console.\nThe program was included in Kernighan and Ritchie's influential book \"The C Programming Language,\" published in 1978. The book became a standard reference for C programmers, and the \"Hello, World!\" program became a sort of \"Hello, World!\" for the programming community.\nOver time, the phrase \"Hello, World!\" became a shorthand for any simple program that demonstrated the basics"
}
```

## 5. Deploy your AI Worker

Before deploying your AI Worker globally, log in with your Cloudflare account by running:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

You will be directed to a web page asking you to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard. After you have logged in, you will be asked if Wrangler can make changes to your Cloudflare account. Scroll down and select **Allow** to continue.

Finally, deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. To deploy your Worker, run:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

```sh output
https://hello-ai.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

Your Worker will be deployed to your custom [`workers.dev`](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) subdomain. You can now visit the URL to run your AI Worker.

By finishing this tutorial, you have created a Worker, connected it to Workers AI through an AI binding, and ran an inference task from the Llama 3 model.
