A handy way to explore all of the models available on [Workers AI](/workers-ai) is to use a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

You can [download the DeepSeek Coder notebook](/workers-ai/static/documentation/notebooks/deepseek-coder-exploration.ipynb) or view the embedded notebook below.

## Exploring Code Generation Using DeepSeek Coder

AI Models being able to generate code unlocks all sorts of use cases. The [DeepSeek Coder](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder) models `@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base-awq` and `@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq` are now available on [Workers AI](/workers-ai).

Let's explore them using the API!

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install requests python-dotenv
```

```
Requirement already satisfied: requests in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (2.31.0)
Requirement already satisfied: python-dotenv in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (1.0.1)
Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (3.3.2)
Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (3.6)
Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (2.1.0)
Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (2023.11.17)
```

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

from IPython.display import display, Image, Markdown, Audio

import requests
```

```python
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv
```

### Configuring your environment

To use the API you'll need your [Cloudflare Account ID](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (head to Workers & Pages > Overview > Account details > Account ID) and a [Workers AI enabled API Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

If you want to add these files to your environment, you can create a new file named `.env`

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" in os.environ:
    api_token = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"]
else:
    api_token = getpass("Enter you Cloudflare API Token")
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" in os.environ:
    account_id = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"]
else:
    account_id = getpass("Enter your account id")
```

### Generate code from a comment

A common use case is to complete the code for the user after they provide a descriptive comment.

````python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base-awq"

prompt = "# A function that checks if a given word is a palindrome"

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
code = inference["result"]["response"]

display(Markdown(f"""
    ```python
    {prompt}
    {code.strip()}
    ```
"""))
````

```python
# A function that checks if a given word is a palindrome
def is_palindrome(word):
    # Convert the word to lowercase
    word = word.lower()

    # Reverse the word
    reversed_word = word[::-1]

    # Check if the reversed word is the same as the original word
    if word == reversed_word:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test the function
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
```

### Assist in debugging

We've all been there, bugs happen. Sometimes those stacktraces can be very intimidating, and a great use case of using Code Generation is to assist in explaining the problem.

```python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq"

system_message = "The user is going to give you code that isn't working. Explain to the user what might be wrong"

code = """# Welcomes our user
def hello_world(first_name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
"""

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": code},
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
response = inference["result"]["response"]
display(Markdown(response))
```

The error in your code is that you are trying to use a variable `name` which is not defined anywhere in your function. The correct variable to use is `first_name`. So, you should change `f"Hello, {name}!"` to `f"Hello, {first_name}!"`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Welcomes our user
def hello_world(first_name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {first_name}")
```

Now, when you call `hello_world()`, it will print "Hello, World" by default. If you call `hello_world("John")`, it will print "Hello, John".

### Write tests!

Writing unit tests is a common best practice. With the enough context, it's possible to write unit tests.

```python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq"

system_message = "The user is going to give you code and would like to have tests written in the Python unittest module."

code = """
class User:

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name=None):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        if last_name is None:
            self.last_name = "Mc" + self.first_name

    def full_name(self):
        return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
"""

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": code},
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
response = inference["result"]["response"]
display(Markdown(response))
```

Here is a simple unittest test case for the User class:

```python
import unittest

class TestUser(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_full_name(self):
        user = User("John", "Doe")
        self.assertEqual(user.full_name(), "John Doe")

    def test_default_last_name(self):
        user = User("Jane")
        self.assertEqual(user.full_name(), "Jane McJane")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test case, we have two tests:

* `test_full_name` tests the `full_name` method when the user has both a first name and a last name.
* `test_default_last_name` tests the `full_name` method when the user only has a first name and the last name is set to "Mc" + first name.

If all these tests pass, it means that the `full_name` method is working as expected. If any of these tests fail, it

### Fill-in-the-middle Code Completion

A common use case in Developer Tools is to autocomplete based on context. DeepSeek Coder provides the ability to submit existing code with a placeholder, so that the model can complete in context.

Warning: The tokens are prefixed with `<｜` and suffixed with `｜>` make sure to copy and paste them.

````python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base-awq"

code = """
<｜fim▁begin｜>import re

from jklol import email_service

def send_email(email_address, body):
    <｜fim▁hole｜>
    if not is_valid_email:
        raise InvalidEmailAddress(email_address)
    return email_service.send(email_address, body)<｜fim▁end｜>
"""

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": code}
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
response = inference["result"]["response"]
display(Markdown(f"""
    ```python
    {response.strip()}
    ```
"""))

````

```python
is_valid_email = re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email_address)
```

### Experimental: Extract data into JSON

No need to threaten the model or bring grandma into the prompt. Get back JSON in the format you want.

````python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq"

# Learn more at https://json-schema.org/
json_schema = """

  "title": "User",

      "description": "The user's first name",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {

      "type": "string"
    },
    "numKids": {

      "type": "integer"
    },

      "type": "array",
      "items": {

system_prompt = f"""
