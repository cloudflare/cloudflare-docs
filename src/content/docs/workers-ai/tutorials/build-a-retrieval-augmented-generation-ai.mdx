This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying your first application with Cloudflare AI. You will build a fully-featured AI-powered application, using tools like Workers AI, Vectorize, D1, and Cloudflare Workers.

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built an AI tool that allows you to store information and query it using a Large Language Model. This pattern, known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a useful project you can build by combining multiple aspects of Cloudflare's AI toolkit. You do not need to have experience working with AI tools to build this application.

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

You will also need access to [Vectorize](/vectorize/platform/pricing/).

## 1. Create a new Worker project

C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`) is a command-line tool designed to help you setup and deploy Workers to Cloudflare as fast as possible.

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"rag-ai-tutorial"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Worker",
		three: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

In your project directory, C3 has generated several files.

<Details header="What files did C3 create?">

1. `wrangler.toml`: Your [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#sample-wranglertoml-configuration) configuration file.
2. `worker.js` (in `/src`): A minimal `'Hello World!'` Worker written in [ES module](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) syntax.
3. `package.json`: A minimal Node dependencies configuration file.
4. `package-lock.json`: Refer to [`npm` documentation on `package-lock.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json).
5. `node_modules`: Refer to [`npm` documentation `node_modules`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/folders#node-modules).

</Details>

Now, move into your newly created directory:

```sh
cd rag-ai-tutorial
```

## 2. Develop with Wrangler CLI

The Workers command-line interface, [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), allows you to [create](/workers/wrangler/commands/#init), [test](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev), and [deploy](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) your Workers projects. C3 will install Wrangler in projects by default.

After you have created your first Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to test your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev --remote
```

:::note

If you have not used Wrangler before, it will try to open your web browser to login with your Cloudflare account.

If you have issues with this step or you do not have access to a browser interface, refer to the [`wrangler login`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#login) documentation for more information.

:::

You will now be able to go to [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) to see your Worker running. Any changes you make to your code will trigger a rebuild, and reloading the page will show you the up-to-date output of your Worker.

## 3. Adding the AI binding

To begin using Cloudflare's AI products, you can add the `ai` block to `wrangler.toml`. This will set up a binding to Cloudflare's AI models in your code that you can use to interact with the available AI models on the platform.

This example features the [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct` model](/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/), which generates text.

```toml
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

Now, find the `src/index.js` file. Inside the `fetch` handler, you can query the `AI` binding:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		const answer = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct", {
			messages: [{ role: "user", content: `What is the square root of 9?` }],
		});

		return new Response(JSON.stringify(answer));
	},
};
```

By querying the LLM through the `AI` binding, we can interact directly with Cloudflare AI's large language models directly in our code. In this example, we are using the [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct` model](/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/), which generates text.

You can deploy your Worker using `wrangler`:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Making a request to your Worker will now generate a text response from the LLM, and return it as a JSON object.

```sh
curl https://example.username.workers.dev
```

```sh output
{"response":"Answer: The square root of 9 is 3."}
```

## 4. Adding embeddings using Cloudflare D1 and Vectorize

Embeddings allow you to add additional capabilities to the language models you can use in your Cloudflare AI projects. This is done via **Vectorize**, Cloudflare's vector database.

To begin using Vectorize, create a new embeddings index using `wrangler`. This index will store vectors with 768 dimensions, and will use cosine similarity to determine which vectors are most similar to each other:

```sh
npx wrangler vectorize create vector-index --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
```

Then, add the configuration details for your new Vectorize index to `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# ... existing wrangler configuration

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTOR_INDEX"
index_name = "vector-index"
```

A vector index allows you to store a collection of dimensions, which are floating point numbers used to represent your data. When you want to query the vector database, you can also convert your query into dimensions. **Vectorize** is designed to efficiently determine which stored vectors are most similar to your query.

To implement the searching feature, you must set up a D1 database from Cloudflare. In D1, you can store your app's data. Then, you change this data into a vector format. When someone searches and it matches the vector, you can show them the matching data.

Create a new D1 database using `wrangler`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create database
```

Then, paste the configuration details output from the previous command into `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# ... existing wrangler configuration

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "database"
database_id = "abc-def-geh" # replace this with a real database_id (UUID)
```

In this application, we'll create a `notes` table in D1, which will allow us to store notes and later retrieve them in Vectorize. To create this table, run a SQL command using `wrangler d1 execute`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute database --remote --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, text TEXT NOT NULL)"
```

Now, we can add a new note to our database using `wrangler d1 execute`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute database --remote --command "INSERT INTO notes (text) VALUES ('The best pizza topping is pepperoni')"
```

## 5. Creating notes and adding them to Vectorize

To expand on your Workers function in order to handle multiple routes, we will add `hono`, a routing library for Workers. This will allow us to create a new route for adding notes to our database. Install `hono` using `npm`:

```sh
npm install hono
```

Then, import `hono` into your `src/index.js` file. You should also update the `fetch` handler to use `hono`:

```js
import { Hono } from "hono";
const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", async (c) => {
	const answer = await c.env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct", {
		messages: [{ role: "user", content: `What is the square root of 9?` }],
	});

	return c.json(answer);
});

export default app;
```

This will establish a route at the root path `/` that is functionally equivalent to the previous version of your application. Now, we can add a new route for adding notes to our database.

This example features the [`@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` model](/workers-ai/models/bge-base-en-v1.5/), which can be used to create an embedding. Embeddings are stored and retrieved inside [Vectorize](/vectorize/), Cloudflare's vector database. The user query is also turned into an embedding so that it can be used for searching within Vectorize.

```js
app.post("/notes", async (c) => {
	const { text } = await c.req.json();
	if (!text) {
		return c.text("Missing text", 400);
	}

	const { results } = await c.env.DB.prepare(
		"INSERT INTO notes (text) VALUES (?) RETURNING *",
	)
		.bind(text)
		.run();

	const record = results.length ? results[0] : null;

	if (!record) {
		return c.text("Failed to create note", 500);
	}

	const { data } = await c.env.AI.run("@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5", {
		text: [text],
	});
	const values = data[0];

	if (!values) {
		return c.text("Failed to generate vector embedding", 500);
	}

	const { id } = record;
	const inserted = await c.env.VECTOR_INDEX.upsert([
		{
			id: id.toString(),
			values,
		},
	]);

	return c.json({ id, text, inserted });
});
```

This function does the following things:

1. Parse the JSON body of the request to get the `text` field.
2. Insert a new row into the `notes` table in D1, and retrieve the `id` of the new row.
3. Convert the `text` into a vector using the `embeddings` model of the LLM binding.
4. Upsert the `id` and `vectors` into the `vector-index` index in Vectorize.
5. Return the `id` and `text` of the new note as JSON.

By doing this, you will create a new vector representation of the note, which can be used to retrieve the note later.

## 6. Querying Vectorize to retrieve notes

To complete your code, you can update the root path (`/`) to query Vectorize. You will convert the query into a vector, and then use the `vector-index` index to find the most similar vectors.

The `topK` parameter limits the number of vectors returned by the function. For instance, providing a `topK` of 1 will only return the *most similar* vector based on the query. Setting `topK` to 5 will return the 5 most similar vectors.


Given a list of similar vectors, you can retrieve the notes that match the record IDs stored alongside those vectors. In this case, we are only retrieving a single note - but you may customize this as needed.

You can insert the text of those notes as context into the prompt for the LLM binding. This is the basis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG: providing additional context from data outside of the LLM to enhance the text generated by the LLM.

We'll update the prompt to include the context, and to ask the LLM to use the context when responding:

```js
import { Hono } from "hono";
const app = new Hono();

// Existing post route...
// app.post('/notes', async (c) => { ... })

app.get('/', async (c) => {
  const question = c.req.query('text') || "What is the square root of 9?"

  const embeddings = await c.env.AI.run('@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5', { text: question })
  const vectors = embeddings.data[0]

  const vectorQuery = await c.env.VECTOR_INDEX.query(vectors, { topK: 1 });
  const vecId = vectorQuery.matches[0].id

  let notes = []
  if (vecId) {
    const query = `SELECT * FROM notes WHERE id = ?`
    const { results } = await c.env.DB.prepare(query).bind(vecId).all()
    if (results) notes = results.map(vec => vec.text)
  }

  const contextMessage = notes.length
    ? `Context:\n${notes.map(note => `- ${note}`).join("\n")}`
    : ""

  const systemPrompt = `When answering the question or responding, use the context provided, if it is provided and relevant.`

  const { response: answer } = await c.env.AI.run(
    '@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct',
    {
      messages: [
        ...(notes.length ? [{ role: 'system', content: contextMessage }] : []),
        { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
        { role: 'user', content: question }
      ]
    }
  )

  return c.text(answer);
});

app.onError((err, c) => {
	return c.text(err);
});

export default app;
```

## 7. Deleting notes and vectors

If you no longer need a note, you can delete it from the database. Any time that you delete a note, you will also need to delete the corresponding vector from Vectorize. You can implement this by building a `DELETE /notes/:id` route in your `src/index.js` file:

```js
app.delete('/notes/:id', async (c) => {
  const { id } = c.req.param();

  const query = `DELETE FROM notes WHERE id = ?`
  await c.env.DATABASE.prepare(query).bind(id).run()

  await c.env.VECTOR_INDEX.deleteByIds([id])

  return c.status(204)
})
```

## 8. Deploy your project

If you did not deploy your Worker during [step 1](/workers/get-started/guide/#1-create-a-new-worker-project), deploy your Worker via Wrangler, to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain, or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), if you have one configured. If you have not configured any subdomain or domain, Wrangler will prompt you during the publish process to set one up.

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Preview your Worker at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

:::note[Note]

When pushing to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain for the first time, you may see [`523` errors](/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-5xx-errors/#error-523-origin-is-unreachable) while DNS is propagating. These errors should resolve themselves after a minute or so.
