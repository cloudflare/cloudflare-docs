:::note

Workflows is in **public beta**, and any developer with a [free or paid Workers plan](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) can start using Workflows immediately.

To learn more about Workflows and how it works, read [the beta announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-workflows-durable-execution-on-workers).

:::

Workflows allow you to build durable, multi-step applications using the Workers platform. A Workflow can automatically retry, persist state, run for hours or days, and coordinate between third-party APIs.

You can build Workflows to post-process file uploads to [R2 object storage](/r2/), automate generation of [Workers AI](/workers-ai/) embeddings into a [Vectorize](/vectorize/) vector database, or to trigger user lifecycle emails using your favorite email API.

## Prerequisites

:::caution

This guide is for users who are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers the [durable execution](/workflows/reference/glossary/) programming model it enables.

If you are new to either, we recommend the [introduction to Workflows](/workflows/get-started/guide/) guide, which walks you through how a Workflow is defined, how to persist state, and how to deploy and run your first Workflow.

## 1. Create a Workflow

Workflows are defined as part of a Worker script.

To create a Workflow, use the `create cloudflare` (C3) CLI tool, specifying the Workflows starter template:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest workflows-starter -- --template "cloudflare/workflows-starter"
```

This will create a new folder called `workflows-tutorial`, which contains two files:

* `src/index.ts` - this is where your Worker script, including your Workflows definition, is defined.
* `wrangler.toml` - the configuration for your Workers project and your Workflow.

Open the `src/index.ts` file in your text editor. This file contains the following code, which is the most basic instance of a Workflow definition:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkflowStep, WorkflowEvent } from 'cloudflare:workers';

type Env = {
	// Add your bindings here, e.g. Workers KV, D1, Workers AI, etc.
	MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
};

// User-defined params passed to your workflow
type Params = {
	email: string;
	metadata: Record<string, string>;
};

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// Can access bindings on `this.env`
		// Can access params on `event.params`

		const files = await step.do('my first step', async () => {
			// Fetch a list of files from $SOME_SERVICE
			return {
				inputParams: event,
				files: [
					'doc_7392_rev3.pdf',
					'report_x29_final.pdf',
					'memo_2024_05_12.pdf',
					'file_089_update.pdf',
					'proj_alpha_v2.pdf',
					'data_analysis_q2.pdf',
					'notes_meeting_52.pdf',
					'summary_fy24_draft.pdf',
				],
			};
		});

		const apiResponse = await step.do('some other step', async () => {
			let resp = await fetch('https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/ips');
			return await resp.json<any>();
		});

		await step.sleep('wait on something', '1 minute');

		await step.do(
			'make a call to write that could maybe, just might, fail',
			// Define a retry strategy
			{
				retries: {
					limit: 5,
					delay: '5 second',
					backoff: 'exponential',
				},
				timeout: '15 minutes',
			},
			async () => {
				// Do stuff here, with access to the state from our previous steps
				if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
					throw new Error('API call to $STORAGE_SYSTEM failed');
				}
			},
		);
	}
}

export default {
	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		let id = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get('instanceId');

		// Get the status of an existing instance, if provided
		if (id) {
			let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(id);
			return Response.json({
				status: await instance.status(),
			});
		}

		// Spawn a new instance and return the ID and status
		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create();
		return Response.json({
			id: instance.id,
			details: await instance.status(),
		});
	},
};
```

Specifically, the code above:

1. Extends the Workflows base class (`WorkflowsEntrypoint`) and defines a `run` method for our Workflow.
2. Passes in our `Params` type as a [type parameter](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) so that events that trigger our Workflow are typed.
3. Defines several steps that return state.
4. Defines a custom retry configuration for a step.
5. Binds to the Workflow from a Worker's `fetch` handler so that we can create (trigger) instances of our Workflow via a HTTP call.

You can edit this Workflow by adding (or removing) additional `step` calls, changing the retry configuration, and/or making your own API calls. This Workflow template is designed to illustrate some of Workflows APIs.

## 2. Deploy a Workflow

Workflows are deployed via [`wrangler`](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), which is installed when you first ran `npm create cloudflare` above. Workflows are Worker scripts, and are deployed the same way:

```sh
npx wrangler@latest deploy
```

## 3. Run a Workflow

You can run a Workflow via the `wrangler` CLI, via a Worker binding, or via the Workflows [REST API](/api/operations/wor-list-workflows).

### `wrangler` CLI

```sh
# Trigger a Workflow from the CLI, and pass (optional) parameters as an event to the Workflow.
npx wrangler@latest workflows trigger workflows-tutorial --params={"email": "user@example.com", "metadata": {"id": "1"}}
```

Refer to the [events and parameters documentation](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) to understand how events are passed to Workflows.

### Worker binding

You can [bind to a Workflow](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#what-is-a-binding) from any handler in a Workers script, allowing you to programatically trigger and pass parameters to a Workflow instance from your own application code.

To bind a Workflow to a Worker, you need to define a `[[workflows]]` binding in your `wrangler.toml` configuration:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
[[workflows]]
# name of your workflow
name = "workflows-starter"
# binding name env.MYWORKFLOW
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
# this is class that extends the Workflow class in src/index.ts
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
```

You can then invoke the methods on this binding directly from your Worker script's `env` parameter. The `Workflow` type has methods for:

* `create()` - creating (triggering) a new instance of the Workflow, returning the ID.
* `get()`- retrieve a Workflow instance by its ID.
* `status()` - get the current status of a unique Workflow instance.

For example, the following Worker will fetch the status of an existing Workflow instance by ID (if supplied), else it will create a new Workflow instance and return its ID:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
// Import the Workflow definition
import { WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkflowStep, WorkflowEvent} from 'cloudflare:workers';

interface Env {
  // Matches the binding definition in your wrangler.toml
  MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
}

export default {
	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		let id = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get('instanceId');

		// Get the status of an existing instance, if provided
		if (id) {
			let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(id);
			return Response.json({
				status: await instance.status(),
			});
		}

		// Spawn a new instance and return the ID and status
		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create();
		return Response.json({
			id: instance.id,
			details: await instance.status(),
		});
	},
};
```

Refer to the [triggering Workflows](/workflows/build/trigger-workflows/) documentation for how to trigger a Workflow from other Workers' handler functions.

## 4. Manage Workflows

:::note

The `wrangler workflows` command requires Wrangler version `3.83.0` or greater. Use `npx wrangler@latest` to always use the latest Wrangler version when invoking commands.

:::

The `wrangler workflows` command group has several sub-commands for managing and inspecting Workflows and their instances:

* List Workflows: `wrangler workflows list`
* Inspect the instances of a Workflow: `wrangler workflows instances list YOUR_WORKFLOW_NAME`
* View the state of a running Workflow instance by its ID: `wrangler workflows instances describe YOUR_WORKFLOW_NAME WORKFLOW_ID`

You can also view the state of the latest instance of a Workflow by using the `latest` keyword instead of an ID:

```sh
npx wrangler@latest workflows instances describe workflows-starter latest
# Or by ID:
# npx wrangler@latest workflows instances describe workflows-starter 12dc179f-9f77-4a37-b973-709dca4189ba
```

The output of `instances describe` shows:

* The status (success, failure, running) of each step
* Any state emitted by the step
* Any `sleep` state, including when the Workflow will wake up
* Retries associated with each step
* Errors, including exception messages

:::note

You do not have to wait for a Workflow instance to finish executing to inspect its current status. The `wrangler workflows instances describe` sub-command will show the status of an in-progress instance, including any persisted state, if it is sleeping, and any errors or retries. This can be especially useful when debugging a Workflow during development.
