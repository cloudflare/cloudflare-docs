:::note

Workflows is in **public beta**, and any developer with a [free or paid Workers plan](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) can start using Workflows immediately.

To learn more about Workflows, read [the beta announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/THE-BLOG-SLUG-WILL-GO-HERE) and the [How Workflows Works](/workflows/build/how-workflows-works/) developer documentation.

:::

Workflows allow you to build durable, multi-step applications using the Workers platform. A Workflow can automatically retry, persist state, run for hours or days, and coordinate between third-party APIs.

You can build Workflows to post-process file uploads to [R2 object storage](/r2/), automate generation of [Workers AI](/workers-ai/) embeddings into a [Vectorize](/vectorize/) vector database, or to trigger [user lifecycle emails](TODO) using your favorite email API.

## Prerequisites

:::note

This guide is for users who are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers and [durable execution](/workflows/how-workflows-works/) programming models.

If you're new to either, we recommend the [introduction to Workflows](/workflows/get-started/guide/) guide, which steps through how a Workflow is defined, how to persist state, deploy and manage Workflows.

:::

Before you continue, ensure you:

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.
2. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
3. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

## 1. Create a Workflow

Workflows are defined as part of a Worker script.

To create a Workflow, use the `create cloudflare` (C3) CLI tool, specifying the Workflows starter template:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest workflows-tutorial -- --template "cloudflare:workflows-tutorial"
```

This will create a new folder called `workflows-tutorial`, which contains two files:

* `src/index.ts` - this is where your Worker script, including your Workflows definition, is defined.
* `wrangler.toml` - the configuration for your Workers project and your Workflow.

Open the `src/index.ts` file in your text editor. This file contains the following code, which is the most basic instance of a Workflow definition:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
// Import the Workflow definition
import { Workflow, WorkflowEvent, WorkflowStep } from "cloudflare:workflows"

// Create your own class that implements a Workflow
export class MyFirstWorkflow implements Workflow {
    // Define a run() method
    async run(event: WorkflowEvent, step: WorkflowStep) {
        // Define one or more steps that optionally return state.
        let state = step.do("my first step", async () => {
          
        })

        step.do("my second step", async () => {

        })
    }
}
```

Specifically:

1. TODO - describe the Workflow class
2. TODO - how params are injected
3. TODO - how state is persisted
4. TODO - retries and config
5. TODO - triggering from a fetch handler
 
```ts title="src/index.ts"


```

## 2. Deploy a Workflow

Workflows are deployed via [`wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), which is installed when you first ran `npm create cloudflare`, above. Workflows are Workers scripts, and deployed the same way.

```sh
npx wrangler@latest deploy
```
```sh output
TODO
```

## 3. Running a Workflow

TODO - basic trigger steps
```sh
npx wrangler@latest workflows trigger workflows-tutorial --params={"hello":"world"}
```

TODO - trigger from a Worker

## 4. Managing Workflows

TODO - managing via the CLI

* Listing
* Showing running instances
* Inspecting an instances state

## Next steps

* TODO
* ALSO TODO
* ALSO ALSO TODO
