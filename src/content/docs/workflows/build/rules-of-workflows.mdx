A Workflow contains one or more steps. Each step is a self-contained, individually retriable component of a Workflow. Steps may emit (optional) state that allows a Workflow to persist and continue from that step, even if a Workflow fails due to a network or infrastructure issue.

This is a small guidebook on how to build more resilient and correct Workflows.

### Ensure API/Binding calls are idempotent

Because a step might be retried multiple times, your steps should (ideally) be idempotent. For context, idempotency is a logical property where the operation (in this case a step),
can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

As an example, let us assume you have a Workflow that charges your customers, and you really do not want to charge them twice by accident. Before charging them, you should
check if they were already charged:

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		const customer_id = 123456;
		// âœ… Good: Non-idempotent API/Binding calls are always done **after** checking if the operation is
		// still needed.
		await step.do(
			`charge ${customer_id} for it's montly subscription`,
			async () => {
				// API call to check if customer was already charged
				const subscription = await fetch(
					`https://payment.processor/subscriptions/${customer_id}`,
				).then((res) => res.json());

				// return early if the customer was already charged, this can happen if the destination service dies
				// in the middle of the request but still commits it, or if the Workflows Engine restarts.
				if (subscription.charged) {
					return;
				}

				// non-idempotent call, this operation can fail and retry but still commit in the payment
				// processor - which means that, on retry, it would mischarge the customer again if the above checks
				// were not in place.
				return await fetch(
					`https://payment.processor/subscriptions/${customer_id}`,
					{
						method: "POST",
						body: JSON.stringify({ amount: 10.0 }),
					},
				);
			},
		);
	}
}
```

:::note

Guaranteeing idempotency might be optional in your specific use-case and implementation, but we recommend that you always try to guarantee it.

### Make your steps granular

Steps should be as self-contained as possible. This allows your own logic to be more durable in case of failures in third-party APIs, network errors, and so on.

You can also think of it as a transaction, or a unit of work.

- âœ… Minimize the number of API/binding calls per step (unless you need multiple calls to prove idempotency).

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// âœ… Good: Unrelated API/Binding calls are self-contained, so that in case one of them fails
		// it can retry them individually. It also has an extra advantage: you can control retry or
		// timeout policies for each granular step - you might not to want to overload http.cat in
		// case of it being down.
		const httpCat = await step.do("get cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			return await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat");
		});

		const image = await step.do("fetch cat image from http.cat", async () => {
			return await fetch(`https://http.cat/${httpCat}`);
		});
	}
}
```

Otherwise, your entire Workflow might not be as durable as you might think, and you may encounter some undefined behaviour. You can avoid them by following the rules below:

- ðŸ”´ Do not encapsulate your entire logic in one single step.
- ðŸ”´ Do not call separate services in the same step (unless you need it to prove idempotency).
- ðŸ”´ Do not make too many service calls in the same step (unless you need it to prove idempotency).
- ðŸ”´ Do not do too much CPU-intensive work inside a single step - sometimes the engine may have to restart, and it will start over from the beginning of that step.

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// ðŸ”´ Bad: you're calling two seperate services from within the same step. This might cause
		// some extra calls to the first service in case the second one fails, and in some cases, makes
		// the step non-idempotent altogether
		const image = await step.do("get cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			const httpCat = await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat");
			return fetch(`https://http.cat/${httpCat}`);
		});
	}
}
```

### Do not rely on state outside of a step

Workflows may hibernate and lose all in-memory state. This will happen when engine detects that there is no pending work and can hibernate until it needs to wake-up (because of a sleep, retry, or event).

This means that you should not store state outside of a step:

```ts
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
	const minCeiled = Math.ceil(min);
	const maxFloored = Math.floor(max);
	return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxFloored - minCeiled) + minCeiled); // The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// ðŸ”´ Bad: `imageList` will be not persisted across engine's lifetimes. Which means that after hibernation,
		// `imageList` will be empty again, even though the following two steps have already ran.
		const imageList: string[] = [];

		await step.do("get first cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			const httpCat = await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-1");

			imageList.append(httpCat);
		});

		await step.do("get second cutest cat from KV", async () => {
			const httpCat = await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-2");

			imageList.append(httpCat);
		});

		// A long sleep can (and probably will) hibernate the engine which means that the first engine lifetime ends here
		await step.sleep("ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤", "3 hours");

		// When this runs, it will be on the second engine lifetime - which means `imageList` will be empty.
		await step.do(
			"choose a random cat from the list and download it",
			async () => {
				const randomCat = imageList.at(getRandomInt(0, imageList.length));
				// this will fail since `randomCat` is undefined because `imageList` is empty
				return await fetch(`https://http.cat/${randomCat}`);
			},
		);
	}
}
```

Instead, you should build top-level state exclusively comprised of `step.do` returns:

```ts
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
	const minCeiled = Math.ceil(min);
	const maxFloored = Math.floor(max);
	return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxFloored - minCeiled) + minCeiled); // The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// âœ… Good: imageList state is exclusively comprised of step returns - this means that in the event of
		// multiple engine lifetimes, imageList will be built accordingly
		const imageList: string[] = await Promise.all([
			step.do("get first cutest cat from KV", async () => {
				return await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-1");
			}),

			step.do("get second cutest cat from KV", async () => {
				return await env.KV.get("cutest-http-cat-2");
			}),
		]);

		// A long sleep can (and probably will) hibernate the engine which means that the first engine lifetime ends here
		await step.sleep("ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤", "3 hours");

		// When this runs, it will be on the second engine lifetime - but this time, imageList will contain
		// the two most cutest cats
		await step.do(
			"choose a random cat from the list and download it",
			async () => {
				const randomCat = imageList.at(getRandomInt(0, imageList.length));
				// this will eventually succeed since `randomCat` is defined
				return await fetch(`https://http.cat/${randomCat}`);
			},
		);
	}
}
```

### Do not mutate your incoming events

The `event` passed to your Workflow's `run` method is immutable: changes you make to the event are not persisted across steps and/or Workflow restarts.

```ts
interface MyEvent {
  user: string;
  data: string;
}

export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<MyEvent>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// ðŸ”´ Bad: Mutating the event
		// This will not be persisted across steps and `event.data` will
		// take on its original value.
		await step.do("bad step that mutates the incoming event", async () => {
		    let userData = await env.KV.get(event.user)
				event.data = userData
		})

		// âœ… Good: persist data by returning it as state from your step
		// Use that state in subsequent steps
		let userData = await step.do("good step that returns state", async () => {
		  return await env.KV.get(event.user)
		})

		let someOtherData await step.do("following step that uses that state", async () => {
		  // Access to userData here
			// Will always be the same if this step is retried
		})
```

### Name steps deterministically

Dynamically naming a step will prevent it from being cached, and cause the step to be re-run unnecessarily. Step names act as the "cache key" in your Workflow.

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
		// ðŸ”´ Bad: Dynamically naming the step prevents it from being cached
		// This will cause the step to be re-run if subsequent steps fail.
		await step.do(`step #1 running at: ${Date.now}`, async () => {
		    let userData = await env.KV.get(event.user)
				event.data = userData
		})

		// âœ… Good: give steps a deterministic name.
		// Return dynamic values in your state, or log them instead.
		let state = await step.do("fetch user data from KV", async () => {
		    let userData = await env.KV.get(event.user)
				console.log(`fetched at ${Date.now})
				return userData
		})
```
