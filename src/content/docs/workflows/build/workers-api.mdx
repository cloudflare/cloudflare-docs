This guide details the Workflows API within Cloudflare Workers, including methods, types, and usage examples.

## WorkflowEntrypoint

The `WorkflowEntrypoint` class is the core element of a Workflow definition. A Workflow must extend this class and define a `run` method with at least one `step` call to be considered a valid Workflow.

```ts
export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
	  // Steps here
	}
};
```

* <code>run(event: WorkflowEvent&lt;T&gt;, step: WorkflowStep): Promise&lt;T&gt;</code>

  * `event` - the event passed to the Workflow, including an optional `payload` containing data (parameters)
  * `step` - the `WorkflowStep` type that provides the step methods for your Workflow

The `WorkflowEvent` type accepts an optional [type parameter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#working-with-generic-type-variables) that allows you to provide a type for the `payload` property within the `WorkflowEvent`.

Refer to the [events and parameters](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) documentation for how to handle events within yur Workflow code.

## WorkflowEvent

```ts
export type WorkflowEvent<T> = {
  payload: Readonly<T>;
  timestamp: Date;
};
```

* The `WorkflowEvent` is the first argument to a Workflow's `run` method, and includes an optional `payload` parameter and a `timestamp` property.

  * `payload` - a default type of `any` or type `T` if a type parameter is provided.
  * `timestamp` - a `Date` object set to the time the Workflow instance was created (triggered).

Refer to the [events and parameters](/workflows/build/events-and-parameters/) documentation for how to handle events within yur Workflow code.

## WorkflowStep

### step

* <code>step.do(name: string, callback: (): RpcSerializable): Promise&lt;T&gt;</code>
* <code>step.do(name: string, config?: WorkflowStepConfig, callback: (): RpcSerializable): Promise&lt;T&gt;</code>

  * `name` - the name of the step.
  * `config` (optional) - an optional `WorkflowStepConfig` for configuring [step specific retry behaviour](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/).
  * `callback` - an asynchronous function that optionally returns serializable state for the Workflow to persist.

* <code>step.sleep(name: string, duration: WorkflowDuration): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

  * `name` - the name of the step.
  * `duration` - the duration to sleep until, in either seconds or as a `WorkflowDuration` compatible string.
  * Refer to the [documentation on sleeping and retrying](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/) to learn more about how how Workflows are retried.

* <code>step.sleepUntil(name: string, timestamp: Date | number): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

  * `name` - the name of the step.
  * `timestamp` - a JavaScript `Date` object or seconds from the Unix epoch to sleep the Workflow instance until.

## WorkflowStepConfig

```ts
export type WorkflowStepConfig = {
  retries?: {
    limit: number;
    delay: string | number;
    backoff?: WorkflowBackoff;
  };
  timeout?: string | number;
};
```

* A `WorkflowStepConfig` is an optional argument to the `do` method of a `WorkflowStep` and defines properties that allow you to configure the retry behaviour of that step.

Refer to the [documentation on sleeping and retrying](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/) to learn more about how how Workflows are retried.

## NonRetryableError

* <code>throw new NonRetryableError(message: <Type text='string' />, name <Type text='string' /> <MetaInfo text='optional' />)</code>: <Type text='NonRetryableError' />

  * Throws an error that forces the current Workflow instance to fail and not be retried.
  * Refer to the [documentation on sleeping and retrying](/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/) to learn more about how how Workflows are retried.

## Call Workflows from Workers

:::note[Workflows beta]

Workflows currently requires you to bind to a Workflow via `wrangler.toml` and does not yet support bindings via the Workers dashboard.

:::

Workflows exposes an API directly to your Workers scripts via the [bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#what-is-a-binding) concept. Bindings allow you to securely call a Workflow without having to manage API keys or clients.

You can bind to a Workflow by defining a `[[workflows]]` binding within your `wrangler.toml` configuration.

For example, to bind to a Workflow called `workflows-starter` and to make it available on the `MY_WORKFLOW` variable to your Worker script, you would configure the following fields within the `[[workflows]]` binding definition:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
#:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
name = "workflows-starter"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-22"

[[workflows]]
# name of your workflow
name = "workflows-starter"
# binding name env.MYWORKFLOW
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
# this is class that extends the Workflow class in src/index.ts
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
# script_name is required during for the beta.
# Must match the "name" of your Worker at the top of wrangler.toml
script_name = "workflows-starter"
```

## Workflow

:::note

Ensure you have `@cloudflare/workers-types` version `4.20241022.0` or later installed when binding to Workflows from within a Workers project.

:::

The `Workflow` type provides methods that allow you to create, inspect the status, and manage running Workflow instances from within a Worker script.

```ts
interface Env {
  // The 'MY_WORKFLOW' variable should match the "binding" value set in wrangler.toml
  MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
}
```

The `Workflow` type exports the following methods:

### create

Create (trigger) a new instance of the given Workflow.

* <code>create(options?: WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions): Promise&lt;WorkflowInstance&gt;</code>

  * `options` - optional properties to pass when creating an instance.

An ID is automatically generated, but a user-provided ID can be specified. This can be useful when mapping Workflows to users, merchants or other identifiers in your system.

```ts
// Create a new Workflow instance with your own ID:
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({ id: myIdDefinedFromOtherSystem })
return Response.json({
	id: instance.id,
	details: await instance.status(),
});
```

Returns a `WorkflowInstance`.

### get

Get a specific Workflow instance by ID.

* <code>get(id: string): Promise&lt;WorkflowInstance&gt;</code>

  * `id` - the ID of the Workflow instance.

Returns a `WorkflowInstance`.

## WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions

Optional properties to pass when creating an instance.

```ts
interface WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions {
  /**
   * An id for your Workflow instance. Must be unique within the Workflow.
   */
  id?: string;
  /**
   * The event payload the Workflow instance is triggered with
   */
  params?: unknown;
}
```

## WorkflowInstance

Represents a specific instance of a Workflow, and provides methods to manage the instance.

```ts
declare abstract class WorkflowInstance {
  public id: string;
  /**
   * Pause the instance.
   */
  public pause(): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Resume the instance. If it is already running, an error will be thrown.
   */
  public resume(): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Terminate the instance. If it is errored, terminated or complete, an error will be thrown.
   */
  public terminate(): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Restart the instance.
   */
  public restart(): Promise<void>;
  /**
   * Returns the current status of the instance.
   */
  public status(): Promise<InstanceStatus>;
}
```

### id

Return the id of a Workflow.

* <code>id: string</code>

### status

Return the status of a running Workflow instance.

* <code>status(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### pause

Pause a running Workflow instance.

* <code>pause(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### restart

Restart a Workflow instance.

* <code>restart(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### terminate

Terminate a Workflow instance.

* <code>terminate(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>

### InstanceStatus

Details the status of a Workflow instance.

```ts
type InstanceStatus = {
  status:
    | "queued" // means that instance is waiting to be started (see concurrency limits)
    | "running"
    | "paused"
    | "errored"
    | "terminated" // user terminated the instance while it was running
    | "complete"
    | "waiting" // instance is hibernating and waiting for sleep or event to finish
    | "waitingForPause" // instance is finishing the current work to pause
    | "unknown";
  error?: string;
  output?: object;
};
```
