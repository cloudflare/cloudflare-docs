You can trigger Workflows both programmatically and via the Workflows APIs, including:

1. With [Workers](/workers) via HTTP requests in a `fetch` handler, or bindings from a `queue` or `scheduled` handler
2. Using the [Workflows REST API](/api/operations/wor-list-workflows)
2. Via the [wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/commands/#workflows) in your terminal

## Workers API (Bindings)

You can interact with Workflows programmatically from any Worker script by creating a binding to a Workflow. A Worker can bind to multiple Workflows, including Workflows defined in other Workers projects (scripts) within your account.

You can interact with a Workflow:

* Directly over HTTP via the [`fetch`](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/) handler
* From a [Queue consumer](/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#consumer) inside a `queue` handler
* From a [Cron Trigger](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/) inside a `scheduled` handler
* Within a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/)

New to Workflows? Start with the [Workflows tutorial](/workflows/get-started/guide/) to deploy your first Workflow and familiarize yourself with Workflows concepts.

:::

To bind to a Workflow from your Workers code, you need to define a [binding](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to a specific Workflow. For example, to bind to the Workflow defined in the [get started guide](/workflows/get-started/guide/), you would configure a `wrangler.toml` with the below:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "workflows-tutorial"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-10-22"

[[workflows]]
# The name of the Workflow
name = "workflows-tutorial"
# The binding name, which must be a valid JavaScript variable name.  This will
# be how you call (run) your Workflow from your other Workers handlers or
# scripts.
binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
 # script_name is required during for the beta.
 # Must match the "name" of your Worker at the top of wrangler.toml
script_name = "workflows-tutorial"
# Must match the class defined in your code that extends the Workflow class
class_name = "MyWorkflow"
```

The `binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"` line defines the JavaScript variable that our Workflow methods are accessible on, including `create` (which triggers a new instance) or `get` (which returns the status of an existing instance).

The following example shows how you can manage Workflows from within a Worker, including:

* Retrieving the status of an existing Workflow instance by its ID
* Creating (triggering) a new Workflow instance
* Returning the status of a given instance ID

```ts title="src/index.ts"
interface Env {
	MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
}

export default {
	async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
        //
        const instanceId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("instanceId")

        // If an ?instanceId=<id> query parameter is provided, fetch the status
        // of an existing Workflow by its ID.
        if (instanceId) {
            let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(id);
			return Response.json({
				status: await instance.status(),
			});
        }

        // Else, create a new instance of our Workflow, passing in any (optional) params
        // and return the ID.
		const newId = await crypto.randomUUID();
		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create(newId, {});
		return Response.json({
			id: instance.id,
			details: await instance.status(),
		});

		return Response.json({ result });
	},
};
```

### Inspect a Workflow's status

You can inspect the status of any running Workflow instance by calling `status` against a specific instance ID. This allows you to programmatically inspect whether an instance is queued (waiting to be scheduled), actively running, paused, or errored.

```ts
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")
let status = await instance.status() // Returns an InstanceStatus
```

The possible values of status are as follows:

```ts
  status:
    | "queued" // means that instance is waiting to be started (see concurrency limits)
    | "running"
    | "paused"
    | "errored"
    | "terminated" // user terminated the instance while it was running
    | "complete"
    | "waiting" // instance is hibernating and waiting for sleep or event to finish
    | "waitingForPause" // instance is finishing the current work to pause
    | "unknown";
  error?: string;
  output?: object;
};
```

### Explicitly pause a Workflow

You can explicitly pause a Workflow instance (and later resume it) by calling `pause` against a specific instance ID.

```ts
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")
await instance.pause() // Returns Promise<void>
```

### Resume a Workflow

You can resume a paused Workflow instance by calling `resume` against a specific instance ID.

```ts
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")
await instance.resume() // Returns Promise<void>
```

Calling `resume` on an instance that is not currently paused will have no effect.

### Stop a Workflow

You can stop a Workflow instance by calling `abort` against a specific instance ID.

```ts
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")
await instance.abort() // Returns Promise<void>
```

Once stopped, the Workflow instance *cannot* be resumed.

### Restart a Workflow

:::caution

**Known issue**: Restarting a Workflow via the `restart()` method is not currently supported and will throw an exception (error).

:::

```ts
let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")
await instance.restart() // Returns Promise<void>
```

Restarting an instance will immediately cancel any in-progress steps, erase any intermediate state, and treat the Workflow as if it was run for the first time.

## REST API (HTTP)

Refer to the [Workflows REST API documentation](/api/operations/wor-create-new-workflow-instance).

## Command line (CLI)

Refer to the [CLI quick start](/workflows/get-started/cli-quick-start/) to learn more about how to manage and trigger Workflows via the command-line.
