Bot Management for Enterprise is a paid add-on that provides sophisticated bot protection for your domain. Customers can identify automated traffic, take appropriate action, and view detailed analytics within the dashboard.

This Enterprise product provides the most flexibility to customers by:

- Generating a [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) of 1-99 for every request. Scores below 30 are commonly associated with bot traffic.
- Allowing customers to take action on this score with [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) or [`Workers`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties).
- Allowing customers to view this score in Bot Analytics or Logs.
