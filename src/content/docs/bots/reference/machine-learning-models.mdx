## Enable Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Models

Cloudflare allows Enterprise customers to enable Auto-updates to its Machine Learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.

To enable Auto-updates:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Bots**.
3. Select **Configure Bot Management**.
4. Enable **Auto-updates to the Machine Learning Model**.

### What will change

If you are on an older Machine Learning model, you will see a score change to requests scored by the **Machine Learning** source instantly. If you are already on the latest model, you will see changes only after a new Machine Learning model becomes the global default.

Customers will be notified via email and dashboard prior to a new Machine Learning model becoming the global default.

### Risks of not updating

By not updating to the latest version, you will be using a Machine Learning model no longer maintained or monitored by our engineering team. As Internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, scoring accuracy by older versions may degrade.

### Model versions and release notes
