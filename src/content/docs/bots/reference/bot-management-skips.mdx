There are instances in which Bot Management does not run and certain fields, such as the [JA3/JA4 field](/bots/concepts/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/), are not populated because it has been determined that running Bot Management would not be necessary.

Refer to <GlossaryTooltip term="bot score" link="/bots/concepts/bot-score/#not-computed">bot scores</GlossaryTooltip> for more information about why a request is not scored.

## Common reasons for Bot Management to not score a request

### Requests to internal endpoints

Requests such as `/cdn-cgi/` are handled individually and will never receive a Bot Management score. Email Obfuscation, Web Analytics, Trace Requests, Challenge Pages, and JavaScript Detections do not receive bot scores. Refer to the table below for some examples of internal endpoints.

| Route                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/cdn-cgi/rum`                                                    |
| `/cdn-cgi/script_monitor/report`                                  |
| `/cdn-cgi/trace`                                                  |
| `/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/â€¦`                                   |
| `/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js` |
