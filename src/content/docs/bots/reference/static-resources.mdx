import { GlossaryTooltip, Render } from "~/components"

Pro, Business, and Enterprise customers can use Cloudflare's bot solutions to protect their <GlossaryTooltip term="static content">static resources</GlossaryTooltip> from bots.

:::caution[Warning]

If you enable static resource protection, you may block good bots — like mail clients — that routinely fetch static resources. Make sure you understand your existing infrastructure before enabling this feature. 
:::

## Super Bot Fight Mode

To enable this feature as a Pro or Business customer or an Enterprise customer without Bot Management:

1. Go to **Security** > **Bots**.
2. Select **Configure Super Bot Fight Mode**.
3. For **Static resource protection**, select **On**.

## Bot Management for Enterprise

<Render file="static-resources-bm" /> <br/>

To exclude static resources, you would need to include `not (cf.bot_management.static_resource)` as part of your custom rule.

## Which files are protected?

<Render file="static-resources-list" />
