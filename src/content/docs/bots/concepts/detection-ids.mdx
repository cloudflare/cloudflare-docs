<Render file="detection-ids" />

If you are having an issue with one of our heuristics, detection IDs allow you to decide which heuristics to enforce on your zones using customer configurable heuristics. You can choose unique actions for different bots, detected through Cloudflare’s heuristics engine. You can block, allow, or serve alternate content to specific bots to meet the unique needs of your site’s traffic.

:::note

A request can trigger multiple detection IDs. 
:::

You can use `cf.bot_management.detection_ids` fields in tools such as:

- [Custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/)
- [Advanced Rate Limiting](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/)
- [Transform Rules](/rules/transform/)
- [Workers](/workers/) (as `request.cf.botManagement.detectionIds`)

Bot Detection IDs and tags are also available in [Bot Analytics](/bots/bot-analytics/) and [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).

## Detection tags

Detection tags refer to the category associated with the detection ID at the time that Cloudflare has fingerprinted a bot. For example, if a detection tag is `go`, this means that Cloudflare has observed traffic from that detection ID from a Go programming language bot.

:::note

Detection tags are available in Security Analytics, but not in the Security Events.

## Bot Detection IDs via Logpush

You can create or edit their existing Logpush jobs to include the new Bot Detection IDs field which will provide an array of IDs for each request that has heuristics match on it. The `BotDetectionIDs` field is available as part of the HTTP Requests dataset and you can add it to new or existing jobs via the Logpush API or on the Cloudflare dashboard. This is the primary method to discover Detection IDs.

### Via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Analytics & Logs** > **Logs**.
3. Select **Add Logpush Job**.
4. Select **HTTP Requests** as the dataset.
5. Select **BotDetectionIDs** under the General data field category.
6. Select and enter the destination information.
7. Prove the ownership.
8. Select **Save**.

### Via the API

[Update your logpush job](/logs/reference/log-output-options/) by adding `BotDetectionIDs` to the  `output_options:`  parameters.

## Create or edit an expression

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Bots**, apply filters and select **Create custom rule** to create a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/) based on those filters. 
   - Alternatively, if you already created a custom rule, go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Custom rules** and edit the expression of an existing custom rule.
3. Use the `cf.bot_management.detection_ids` field in the rule expression.
4. Select **Save**.

## Use cases

### Block requests that match a specific detection ID

```js
any(cf.bot_management.detection_ids[*] eq 3355446)
and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot
and http.request.uri.path eq "/login"
and http.request.method eq "POST"
```

### Run Bot Management without specific detection IDs

```js
cf.bot_management.score lt 30
and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot
and http.request.uri.path eq "/login"
and http.request.method eq "POST"
and not any(cf.bot_management.detection_ids[*] in {3355446 12577893})
```

## Account takeover detections

<Render file="account-takeover-detections" />

### Challenges for account takeover detections

Cloudflare's [Managed Challenge](/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/) can limit brute-force attacks on your login endpoints.

To access account takeover detections:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **WAF**.
3. Under **Custom Rules**, select **Create rule**.
4. Fill out the form using **Bot Detection IDs** along with other necessary information.
5. Select **Save as draft** to return to it later, or **Deploy** to deploy the rule.

```js title="Rule example"

(any(cf.bot_management.detection_ids[*] eq 201326593))
```

### Limit logins with account takeover detections

Rate limiting rules can limit the number of logins from a particular IP, JA4 Fingerprint, or country.

To use rate limiting rules with account takeover detections:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to ***Security** > **WAF**.
3. Under **Rate limiting rules**, select **Create rule**.
4. Fill out the form using the **Custom expression builder** and `cf.bot_management_detection_ids` along with other necessary information.
5. Select **Save as draft** to return to it later, or **Deploy** to deploy the rule.

:::note
The rule can be enhanced with Leaked Credential Checks. Refer to the [WAF documentation](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) for more information on how to include leaked credentials and account takeover detections in a rate limiting rule.
