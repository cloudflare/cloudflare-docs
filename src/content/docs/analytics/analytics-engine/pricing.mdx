### Data points written

Every time you call [`writeDataPoint()`](/analytics/analytics-engine/get-started/#2-write-data-points-from-your-worker) in a Worker, this counts as one data point written.

Each data point written costs the same amount. There is no extra cost to add dimensions or cardinality, and no additional cost for writing more data in a single data point.

### Read queries

Every time you post to Workers Analytics Engine's [SQL API](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/), this counts as one read query.

Each read query costs the same amount. There is no extra cost for more or less complex queries, and no extra cost for reading only a few rows of data versus many rows of data.
