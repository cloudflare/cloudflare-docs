Cloudflare Network Analytics (version 2) provides near real-time visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Network Analytics visualizes packet and bit-level data, the same data available via the Network Analytics dataset of the GraphQL Analytics API.

For a technical deep-dive into Network Analytics, refer to our [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-network-analytics-v2/).

## Remarks

* The Network Analytics logs refer to IP traffic of Magic Transit customer prefixes/leased IP addresses or Spectrum applications. These logs are not directly associated with the [zones](/fundamentals/setup/accounts-and-zones/#zones) in your Cloudflare account.

* The data retention for Network Analytics is 16 weeks. Additionally, data older than eight weeks might have lower resolution when using narrow time frames.
