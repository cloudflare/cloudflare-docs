In early 2020, Cloudflare released the first version of the Network Analytics dashboard and its corresponding API. The second version (Network Analytics v2) was made available on 2021-09-13.

:::note[Note]


The `attackId` field value may be different between NAv1 and NAv2 for the same attack.


:::

## Node comparison

NAv2 uses the same API endpoint but makes use of new nodes. While NAv1 has three nodes for aggregated roll-ups for all traffic and attacks, and one node for attacks, NAv2 has one node for all traffic and attacks, and four separate nodes for attacks that vary based on the mitigation system.



| Node type      | NAv1                                                          | NAv2 for Magic Transit                                                                                                                                                   | NAv2 for Spectrum                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main node(s)   | `ipFlows1mGroups`<br/>`ipFlows1hGroups`<br/>`ipFlows1dGroups` | `magicTransitNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`                                                                                                                             | `spectrumNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`                              |
| Attack node(s) | `ipFlows1mAttacksGroups`                                      | `dosdNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`<br/> `dosdAttackAnalyticsGroups`<br/> `flowtrackdNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`<br/> `magicFirewallNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups` | `dosdNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`<br/> `dosdAttackAnalyticsGroups` |



Each row represents one packet sample. The data is sampled at Cloudflare’s edge at [various rates](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/network-analytics-v2/node-reference/). You can also query the sample rate from the nodes using the `sample_interval` field.

For reference information on NAv2 nodes, refer to the [NAv2 node reference](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/network-analytics-v2/node-reference/).

:::note[Obtaining data for ingress traffic only]

All the NAv2 `*AnalyticsAdaptiveGroups` nodes include data for ingress and egress traffic. To obtain data about ingress traffic only, include `direction: "ingress"` in your [GraphQL query filter](/analytics/graphql-api/features/filtering/). 
:::

## Schema comparison

Refer to [NAv1 to NAv2 schema map](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/network-analytics-v2/schema-map/) for a mapping of schema fields from NAv1 nodes to NAv2 nodes. Follow this recommended mapping when migrating to NAv2.

## Example

The following example queries the top 20 logs of traffic dropped by mitigation systems different from Magic Firewall within a given time range, ordered by destination IP address.

```graphql
{
  viewer
  {
    accounts(filter: {accountTag: "<REDACTED>"})
    {
      magicTransitNetworkAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups(
        filter: {
          datetime_gt: "2021-10-01T00:00:00Z",
          datetime_lt: "2021-10-05T00:00:00Z",
          outcome_like: "drop",
          mitigationSystem_neq: "magic-firewall"
        },
        limit: 20,
        orderBy: [ipDestinationAddress_ASC])
      {
        dimensions {
          outcome
          mitigationSystem
          ipSourceAddress
          ipDestinationAddress
          ipProtocol
          destinationPort
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Final remarks

The `mitigationSystem` field can take one the following values:

* `dosd` for [DDoS managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/) (Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection or HTTP DDoS Attack Protection).
* `flowtrackd` for [Advanced TCP Protection](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-tcp-protection/).
* `magic-firewall` for [Magic Firewall](/magic-firewall/).
* Empty string for unmitigated traffic.
