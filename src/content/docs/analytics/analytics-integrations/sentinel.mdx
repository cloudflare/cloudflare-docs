Microsoft has developed a Cloudflare connector that allows their customers to integrate [Cloudflare Logs](/logs/) with Microsoft Sentinel.

## How it works

[Logpush](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/azure/) sends logs from Cloudflare to Azure Blob Storage. From there, the Cloudflare connector, a Microsoft function, ingests these logs into Azure Log Analytics Workspace, making them available for monitoring and analysis in Microsoft Sentinel.
