Cloudflare account analytics lets you access a wide range of aggregated metrics from all the sites under a specific Cloudflare account.

## View your account analytics

To view metrics for your site:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

2. Select the appropriate Cloudflare account.

3. Go to **Analytics & Logs** > **Account Analytics**.

Once it loads, the Account Analytics app displays a collection of categorized charts with aggregated metrics for your account. To understand the various metrics available, refer to *Review your account metrics* below.

***

## Review your account metrics

This section outlines the aggregated metrics under each category.  Before reviewing your metrics, let’s define a couple of concepts used in some panels:

* *Rate* -  Reflects the ratio between the amount for a specific data category and the total.
* *Bandwidth* - Refers to the number of bytes sent from the Cloudflare edge network to the requesting client.

Also, note that:

* To filter metrics for a specific time period, use the dropdown in the top right.
* Most metrics are grouped into panels representing different aspects of the underlying data.

### Summary of metrics

Below is a brief description of the major elements comprising the metrics available.

#### HTTP Traffic

These charts aggregate data for HTTP traffic, and include:
