:::note

Status Codes analytics by data center is exclusive to the [enterprise level of service](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/). 
:::

Status Codes metrics in the Cloudflare dashboard **Analytics** app provide customers with a deeper insight into the distribution of errors that are occurring on their website per data center. A data center facility is where Cloudflare runs its servers that make up our edge network ([current locations](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/)).

HTTP status codes that appear in a response passing through our edge are displayed in analytics. 

The `Origin Status Code` can help you investigate issues on your origin. If your origin returns a `5xx` error, Cloudflare's edge will forward this error to the end user. Comparing the `Edge Status Code` and `Origin Status Code` can help determine whether the issue is occurring on your origin or on the Cloudflare edge.

Errors that originate from our edge servers (blank `502`, `503`, or `504` error page with just `Cloudflare`) are not reported as part of the error analytics.

You can filter out specific error(s) by selecting one or more in the legend. You can also exclude a particular error and it will no longer display as part of the graph.

:::note

Users may also see `100x` errors which are not reported. These will be displayed as either `403` or `409` (edge) errors.

## Common edge status codes

- `400` - Bad Request intercepted at the Cloudflare Edge (for example, missing or bad HTTP header)
- `403` - Security functionality (for example, Web Application Firewall, Browser Integrity Check, [Cloudflare challenges](/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/), and most 1xxx error codes)
- `409` - DNS errors typically in the form of 1000 or 1001 error code
- `413` - File size upload exceeded the maximum size allowed (configured in the dashboard under **Network** > **Maximum Upload Size**.)
- `444` - Used by Nginx to indicate that the server has returned no information to the client, and closed the connection. This error code is internal to Nginx and is **not** returned to the client.
- `499` - Used by Nginx to indicate when a connection has been closed by the client while the server is still processing its request, making the server unable to send a status code back.

For more information, refer to [4xx Client Error](/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/4xx-client-error/).

***

## Common origin status codes

- `400` - Origin rejected the request due to bad, or unsupported syntax sent by the application.
- `404` - Only if the origin triggered a 404 response for a request.
- `4xx`
- `50x`

For more information, refer to [4xx Client Error](/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/4xx-client-error/) and [Troubleshooting Cloudflare 5XX errors](/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-5xx-errors/).

***

## 52x errors

- `520` - This is essentially a "catch-all" response for when the origin server returns something unexpected, or something that is not tolerated/cannot be interpreted by our edge (that is, protocol violation or empty response).
- `522` - Our edge could not establish a TCP connection to the origin server.
- `523` - Origin server is unreachable (for example, the origin IP changed but DNS was not updated, or due to network issues between our edge and the origin).
- `524` - Our edge established a TCP connection, but the origin did not reply with a HTTP response before the connection timed out.
- `525` - This error indicates that the SSL handshake between Cloudflare and the origin web server failed, either due to a network issue or a certificare issue at the origin.
- `526` - The certificate configured at the origin is not valid.
