]
```

</WranglerConfig>

## Types of bindings

There are three types of bindings:

- **No attribute defined**: When you do not define an attribute, the binding has no restrictions in place. You can use it to send emails to any verified email address [through Email Routing](/email-routing/setup/email-routing-addresses/#destination-addresses).
- **`destination_address`**: When you define the `destination_address` attribute, you create a targeted binding. This means you can only send emails to the chosen email address. For example, `{type = "send_email", name = "<NAME_FOR_BINDING>", destination_address = "<YOUR_EMAIL>@example.com"}`. <br/> For this particular binding, when you call the `send_email` function you can pass `null` or `undefined` to your Worker and it will assume the email address specified in the binding.
- **`allowed_destination_addresses`**: When you specify this attribute, you create an allowlist, and can send emails to any email address on the list.

## Example Worker

Refer to the example below to learn how to construct a Worker capable of sending emails. This example uses [MIMEText](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mimetext):

:::note
The sender has to be an email from the domain where you have Email Routing active.
:::

```js
import { EmailMessage } from "cloudflare:email";
import { createMimeMessage } from "mimetext";

export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const msg = createMimeMessage();
		msg.setSender({ name: "GPT-4", addr: "<SENDER>@example.com" });
		msg.setRecipient("<RECIPIENT>@example.com");
		msg.setSubject("An email generated in a worker");
		msg.addMessage({
			contentType: "text/plain",
			data: `Congratulations, you just sent an email from a worker.`,
		});

		var message = new EmailMessage(
			"<SENDER>@example.com",
			"<RECIPIENT>@example.com",
			msg.asRaw(),
		);
		try {
			await env.SEB.send(message);
		} catch (e) {
			return new Response(e.message);
		}

		return new Response("Hello Send Email World!");
	},
};
```
