Email Routing provides two options for disabling the service:

* **Delete and Disable**: This option will immediately disable Email Routing and remove its `MX` records. Your custom email addresses will stop working, and your email will not be routed to its final destination.
* **Unlock and keep DNS records**: (Advanced) This option is recommended if you plan to migrate to another provider. It allows you to add new `MX` records before disabling the service. Email Routing will stop working when you change your `MX` records.

## Delete and disable Email Routing

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **Email Routing** > **Settings**.
3. Select **Start disabling** > **Delete and Disable**. Email Routing will show you the list of records associated with your account that will be deleted.
4. Select **Delete records**.

Email Routing is now disabled for your account and will stop forwarding email. To enable the service again, select **Enable Email Routing** and follow the wizard.

## Unlock and keep DNS records

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **Email Routing** > **Settings**.
3. Select **Start disabling** > **Unlock records and continue**.
4. Select **Edit records on DNS**.

You now have the option to edit your DNS records to migrate your service to another provider.
