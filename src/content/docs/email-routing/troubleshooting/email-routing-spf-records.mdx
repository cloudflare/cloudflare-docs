Having multiple [sender policy framework (SPF) records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/) on your account is not allowed, and will prevent Email Routing from working properly. If your account has multiple SPF records, follow these steps to solve the issue:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **Email Routing**. Email Routing will warn you that you have multiple SPF records.
3. Under **View DNS records**, select **Fix records**.
4. Delete the incorrect SPF record.

You should now have your SPF records correctly configured. If you are unsure of which SPF record to delete:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **Email Routing**. Email Routing will warn you that you have multiple SPF records.
3. Under **View DNS records**, select **Fix records**.
4. Delete all SPF records.
5. Select **Add records and enable**.
