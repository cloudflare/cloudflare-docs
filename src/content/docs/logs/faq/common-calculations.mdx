## How can I calculate bytes served by the origin from Cloudflare Logs?




The best way to calculate bytes served by the origin is to use the `CacheResponseBytes` field in Cloudflare Logs, and to filter only requests that come from the origin. Make sure to filter out `OriginResponseStatus` values `0` and `304`, which indicate a revalidated response.



## How do I calculate bandwidth usage for my zone?

Bandwidth (or data transfer) can be calculated by adding the `EdgeResponseBytes` field in HTTP request logs. There are some types of requests that are not factored into bandwidth calculations. In order to only include relevant requests in calculations, add the filter `ClientRequestSource = 'eyeball'`.
