The following table represents the comparison operators that are supported and example values. Filters are added as escaped JSON strings formatted as `{"key":"<field>","operator":"<comparison_operator>","value":"<value>"}`.

* Refer to the [Log fields](/logs/reference/log-fields/) page for a list of fields related to each dataset.

* Comparison operators define how values must relate to fields in the log line for an expression to return true.

* Values represent the data associated with fields.



The filter field has limits of approximately 30 operators and 1000 bytes. Anything exceeding this value will return an error.

## Logical Operators

* Filters can be connected using `AND`, `OR` logical operators.

* Logical operators can be nested.

Here are some examples of how the logical operators can be implemented. `X`, `Y` and `Z` are used to represent filter criteria:

* X AND Y AND Z - `{"where":{"and":[{X},{Y},{Z}]}}`

* X OR Y OR Z - `{"where":{"or":[{X},{Y},{Z}]}}`

* X AND (Y OR Z) - `{"where":{"and":[{X}, {"or":[{Y},{Z}]}]}}`

* (X AND Y) OR Z - `{"where":{"or":[{"and": [{X},{Y}]},{Z}]}}`

## Set filters via API or dashboard

Filters can be set via API or the Cloudflare dashboard. Note that using a filter is optional, but if used, it must contain the `where` key.

### API

Here is an example request using cURL via API:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logpush/jobs \
-H 'X-Auth-Key: <KEY>' \
-H 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"name":"static-assets",
"output_options": {
    "field_names": ["ClientIP", "EdgeStartTimestamp", "RayID"],
    "sample_rate": 0.1,
    "timestamp_format": "rfc3339"
    "CVE-2021-44228": "true"
},
"dataset": "http_requests",
"filter":"{\"where\":{\"and\":[{\"key\":\"ClientRequestPath\",\"operator\":\"contains\",\"value\":\"/static\"},{\"key\":\"ClientRequestHost\",\"operator\":\"eq\",\"value\":\"example.com\"}]}}",
"destination_conf": "s3://<BUCKET_PATH>?region=us-west-2/"
}' | jq .
```

### Dashboard

To set filters through the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select the domain you want to use.
2. Go to **Analytics & Logs** > **Logs**.
3. Select **Add Logpush job**. A modal window will open.
4. Select the dataset you want to push to a storage service.
5. Below **Select data fields**, in the **Filter** section, you can set up your filters.
6. You need to select  a [Field](/logs/reference/log-fields/), an [Operator](/logs/reference/filters/#logical-operators), and a **Value**.
7. You can connect more filters using `AND` and `OR` logical operators.
8. Select **Next** to continue the setting up of your Logpush job.
