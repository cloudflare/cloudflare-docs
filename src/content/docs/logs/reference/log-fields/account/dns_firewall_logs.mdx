## ClientResponseCode

Type: int

Integer value of the response code Cloudflare presents to the client. Response code follows [IANA parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-6).

## ClusterID

Type: string

The ID of the cluster which handled this request.

## ColoCode

Type: string

IATA airport code of data center that received the request.

## EDNSSubnet

## EDNSSubnetLength

Type: int

Size of the [EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)](/glossary/?term=ecs) in bits. For example, if the last octet of an IPv4 address is omitted (`192.0.2.x.`), the subnet length will be 24.

## QueryDO

Type: bool

Indicates if the client is capable of handling a signed response (DNSSEC answer OK).

## QueryName

Type: string

Name of the query that was sent.

## QueryRD

Type: bool

## UpstreamResponseCode

Type: int

Integer value of the response code from the upstream nameserver. Response code follows [IANA parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-6)

## UpstreamResponseTimeMs

Type: int

Upstream response time in milliseconds.
