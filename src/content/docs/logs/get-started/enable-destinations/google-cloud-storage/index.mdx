Cloudflare Logpush supports pushing logs directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) via the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.

## Manage via the Cloudflare dashboard

<Render file="enable-logpush-job" />

5. In **Select a destination**, choose **Google Cloud Storage**.

6. Enter or select the following destination details:
   * **Bucket** - GCS bucket name
   * **Path** - bucket location within the storage container
   * **Organize logs into daily subfolders** (recommended)
   * For **Grant Cloudflare access to upload files to your bucket**, make sure your bucket has added Cloudflareâ€™s IAM as a user with a [Storage Object Admin role](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles).

When you are done entering the destination details, select **Continue**.

7. To prove ownership, Cloudflare will send a file to your designated destination. To find the token, select the **Open** button in the **Overview** tab of the ownership challenge file, then paste it into the Cloudflare dashboard to verify your access to the bucket. Enter the **Ownership Token** and select **Continue**.

8. Select the dataset to push to the storage service.

9. In the next step, you need to configure your logpush job:
   * Enter the **Job name**.
   * Under **If logs match**, you can select the events to include and/or remove from your logs. Refer to [Filters](/logs/reference/filters/) for more information. Not all datasets have this option available.
   * In **Send the following fields**, you can choose to either push all logs to your storage destination or selectively choose which logs you want to push.

10. In **Advanced Options**, you can:
    * Choose the format of timestamp fields in your logs (`RFC3339`(default),`Unix`, or `UnixNano`).
    * Select a [sampling rate](/logs/get-started/api-configuration/#sampling-rate) for your logs or push a randomly-sampled percentage of logs.
    * Enable redaction for `CVE-2021-44228`. This option will replace every occurrence of `${` with `x{`.

11. Select **Submit** once you are done configuring your logpush job.

## Create and get access to a GCS bucket

Cloudflare uses Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to gain access to your bucket. The Cloudflare IAM service account needs admin permission for the bucket.

<Render file="enable-read-permissions" /> <br/>

To enable Logpush to GCS:

1. Create a GCS bucket. Refer to [instructions from GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-console).

2. In **Storage** > **Browser** > **Bucket** > **Permissions**, add the member `logpush@cloudflare-data.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with `Storage Object Admin` permission.
