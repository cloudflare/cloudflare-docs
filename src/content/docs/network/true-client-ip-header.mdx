Enabling the True-Client-IP Header adds the [`True-Client-IP` header](/fundamentals/reference/http-request-headers/#true-client-ip-enterprise-plan-only) to all requests to your origin server, which includes the end userâ€™s IP address.

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="network.true_client_ip_header" />

## Add True-Client-IP Header

The recommended procedure to access client IP information is to [enable the **Add "True-Client-IP" header** Managed Transform](/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/#add-true-client-ip-header).

:::note


In order to use this data, you will need to then retrieve it from the [`True-Client-IP` header](/fundamentals/reference/http-request-headers/#cf-ipcountry).
