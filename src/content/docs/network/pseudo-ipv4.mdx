title: Pseudo IPv4

import { FeatureTable, Render, TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components"

Cloudflare customers can use **Pseudo IPv4** if their origin web server only understands IPv4 formatted IP addresses (meaning it would not support Cloudflare's default [IPv6 compatibility](/network/ipv6-compatibility/)).

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="network.pseudo_ipv4" />

## Background

Some older origin server analytics and fraud detection software expect IP addresses in an IPv4 format and do not support IPv6 addresses.

**Pseudo IPv4** uses the [Class E IPv4 address space](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112#section-4) to provide as many unique IPv4 addresses corresponding to IPv6 addresses as possible.

* Example Class E IPv4 address: `240.16.0.1`
* Example IPv6 address: `2400:cb00:f00d:dead:beef:1111:2222:3333`

:::note

Class E IPv4 addresses are designated as experimental and are not used
for production Internet traffic. 
:::

## Configure Pseudo IPv4

Cloudflare offers three options for configuring **Pseudo IPv4**:

* **Off**: Default value.
* **Add Header**: Cloudflare automatically adds the `Cf-Pseudo-IPv4` header with a Class E IPv4 address hashed from the original IPv6 address.
* **Overwrite Headers**: <Render file="pseudo-ipv4-warning" product="fundamentals" />

:::note

When using *Overwrite Headers*, no software changes are necessary in
your origin web server.

To configure **Pseudo IPv4**:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To change the **Pseudo IPv4** setting in the dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and go to a specific domain.
2. Go to **Network**.
3. For **Pseudo IPv4**, choose your desired setting.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To change **Pseudo IPv4** with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) request with `pseudo_ipv4` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to your desired value: `"off"`, `"add_header"`, or `"overwrite_header"`.

</TabItem> </Tabs>
