Cloudflare supports proxied WebSocket connections without additional configuration.

## Background

WebSockets are open connections sustained between the client and the origin server. Inside a WebSockets connection, the client and the origin can pass data back and forth without having to reestablish sessions. This makes exchanging data within a WebSockets connection fast. WebSockets are often used for real-time applications such as live chat and gaming.

## Enable WebSockets

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To enable **WebSockets** connections to your origin server in the dashboard:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and go to a specific domain.
2. Go to **Network**.
3. For **WebSockets**, switch the toggle to **On**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To enable **WebSockets** connections to your origin server with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) request with `websockets` as the setting name in the URI path, and the `value` parameter set to `"on"`.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::note

Cloudflare also supports [ASP.NET SignalR](http://signalr.net/), which helps negotiate which transport method to use (long polling or WebSockets).

## Availability

WebSockets are supported on all Cloudflare plans.

## Requests and Bandwidth measurement
Based on the understanding of WebSocket nature of connections, you may be aware that it looks a bit different from the usual HTTP traffic in terms of requests and bandwidth. If you’re the Enterprise customer, you will have to take how Cloudflare measures its usage as the requests and bandwidth into account to estimate your usage correctly.

Cloudflare measures a single WebSocket connection as your usage in the following way:

- **Requests**: Cloudflare recognize only the initial upgrade request per WebSocket connection as a HTTP request. Even though you can send the bidirectional message stream through the established WebSocket connection, it’ll be recognized as the single long-lived HTTP request.

- **Bandwidth**: Cloudflare measures the data transfer sent from Cloudflare to the eyeball. This usually means that the message from WebSocket server behind Cloudflare to WebSocket client is subject to be measured as bandwidth.

Once each WebSocket connection is closed, you can see your aggregated usage about WebSocket via [Traffic Analytics](/analytics/account-and-zone-analytics/zone-analytics//#traffic), [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) and [HTTP requests logs](/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/http_requests/).

## Technical note

When Cloudflare releases new code to its global network, we may restart servers, which terminates WebSockets connections.

### Best practises

- Implement a [keepalive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#pings_and_pongs_the_heartbeat_of_websockets).
- Review and then remove or extend timeout settings on the origin and/or on the client.

### Troubleshooting

Investigating issues with Websocket can be facilitated with client tools like [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat).
Being able to reproduce an issue on a single URL with a minimalistic tool helps narrowing down the issue.
