Cloudflare provides two key management solutions: [Geo Key Manager](/ssl/edge-certificates/geokey-manager/) and [Keyless SSL](/ssl/keyless-ssl/) to ensure that private SSL/TLS key material remains in designated regions.

* [Geo Key Manager](/data-localization/key-management/geo-key-manager/): uses Keyless SSL to keep the keys within the specified region, ensuring compliance and data sovereignty.

* [Keyless SSL](/data-localization/key-management/keyless-ssl/): guarantees that Cloudflare never possesses the private key material, enhancing security.
