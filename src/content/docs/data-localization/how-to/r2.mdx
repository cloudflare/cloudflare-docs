In the following sections, we will give you some details about how to configure R2 with Regional Services and Customer Metadata Boundary.

## Regional Services

To configure Regional Services for hostnames [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) through Cloudflare and ensure that processing of requesting objects from a [R2 Bucket](/r2/buckets/) occurs only in-region, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select an account.
2. Go to the **R2** tab.
3. Follow the steps to [create a Bucket](/r2/buckets/create-buckets/).
4. [Connect a bucket to a custom domain](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#connect-a-bucket-to-a-custom-domain).
5. Run the [API POST](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) command on the configured bucket custom domain to create a `regional_hostnames` with a specific region.

Regional Services only applies to the custom domain configured for an R2 Bucket.

## Customer Metadata Boundary

With Customer Metadata Boundary set to `EU`, **R2** > **Bucket** > [**Metrics**](/r2/platform/metrics-analytics/) tab in the account dashboard will be populated.

:::note


Additionally, customers can create R2 buckets with [jurisdictional restrictions set to EU](/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions). In this case, we recommend [using jurisdictions with the S3 API](/r2/reference/data-location/#using-jurisdictions-with-the-s3-api).

Refer to the [R2 documentation](/r2/) for more information.
