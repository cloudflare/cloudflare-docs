In the following sections, we will give you some details about how to configure Workers with Regional Services and Customer Metadata Boundary.

## Regional Services

To configure Regional Services for hostnames [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) through Cloudflare and ensure that processing of a Workers project occurs only in-region, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select an account.
2. Go to the **Workers & Pages** tab.
3. Select your Workers project.
4. Follow the steps to [create a custom domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).
5. Run the [API POST](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) command on the configured Workers Custom Domain to create a `regional_hostnames` with a specific region.

### Caveats

Regional Services only applies to the custom domain configured for a Workers project. Therefore, it will run only in-region Cloudflare locations.

Regional Services does not apply to [subrequests](/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests).

Regional Services does not apply to other Worker triggers, like [Queues](/queues/) or [Cron Triggers](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/).

## Customer Metadata Boundary

Customer Metadata Boundary applies to the custom domain configured, as well as the [`*.workers.dev`](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/#routes-with-workersdev) subdomain.

Workers [Metrics and Analytics](/workers/observability/metrics-and-analytics/) are not available outside the US region when using Customer Metadata Boundary.

With Customer Metadata Boundary set to `EU`, **Workers & Pages** > **Workers** > **Metrics** tab the zone dashboard will not be populated.
