If you have videos stored in a cloud storage bucket, you can pass a HTTP link for the file, and Stream will fetch the file on your behalf.

## Make an HTTP request

Make a `POST` request to the Stream API using the link to your video.

```bash
curl \
--data '{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/zaid-test/Watermarks%20Demo/cf-ad-original.mp4","meta":{"name":"My First Stream Video"}}' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/stream/copy
```

## Check video status

Stream must download and encode the video, which can take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the length of your video.

When the `readyToStream` value returns `true`, your video is ready for streaming.

You can optionally use [webhooks](/stream/manage-video-library/using-webhooks/) which will notify you when the video is ready to stream or if an error occurs.

After the video is uploaded, you can use the video `uid` shown in the example response above to play the video using the [Stream video player](/stream/viewing-videos/using-the-stream-player/). 

If you are using your own player or rendering the video in a mobile app, refer to [using your own player](/stream/viewing-videos/using-the-stream-player/using-the-player-api/).
