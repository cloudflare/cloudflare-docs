## Basic Uploads

For files smaller than 200 MB, you can use simple form-based uploads. 

## Upload through the Cloudflare dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. From the navigation menu, select **Stream**.
3. On the **Overview** page, drag and drop your video into the **Quick upload** area. You can also click to browse for the file on your machine.

After the video finishes uploading, the video appears in the list. 

## Upload with the Stream API

Make a `POST` request with the `content-type` header set to `multipart/form-data` and include the media as an input with the name set to `file`.

```bash title="Upload video POST request"
curl --request POST \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--form file=@/Users/user_name/Desktop/my-video.mp4 \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/stream
```

:::undefined
Note that cURL's `--form` flag automatically configures the `content-type` header and maps `my-video.mp4` to a form input called `file`.
