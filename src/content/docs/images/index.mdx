<Description>

Store, transform, optimize, and deliver images at scale 
</Description>

<Plan type="all" />

Cloudflare Images provides an end-to-end solution designed to help you streamline your image infrastructure from a single API and runs on [Cloudflare's global network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/).

There are two different ways to use Images:

- **Efficiently store and deliver images.** You can upload images into Cloudflare Images and dynamically deliver multiple variants of the same original image.
- **Optimize images that are stored outside of Images** You can make transformation requests to optimize any publicly available image on the Internet.

Cloudflare Images is available on both [Free and Paid plans](/images/pricing/). By default, all users have access to the Images Free plan, which includes limited usage of the transformations feature to optimize images in remote sources.

:::note[Image Resizing is now available as transformations]

All Image Resizing features are available as transformations with Images. Each unique transformation is billed only once per 30 days. 

If you are using a legacy plan with Image Resizing, visit the [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) to switch to an Imagesplan.
