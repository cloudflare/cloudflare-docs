You can delete an image from the Cloudflare Images storage using the dashboard or the API.

## Delete images via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Select **Images**.
3. Find the image you want to remove and select **Delete**.
4. (Optional) To delete more than one image, select the checkbox next to the images you want to delete and then **Delete selected**.

Your image will be deleted from your account.

## Delete images via the API

Make a `DELETE` request to the [delete image endpoint](/api/operations/cloudflare-images-delete-image). `{image_id}` must be fully URL encoded in the API call URL.

```bash
curl --request DELETE https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/images/v1/{image_id} \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

After the image has been deleted, the response returns `"success": true`.
