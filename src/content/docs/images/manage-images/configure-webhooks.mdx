You can set up webhooks to receive notifications about your upload workflow. This will send an HTTP POST request to a specified endpoint when an image either successfully uploads or fails to upload.

Currently, webhooks are supported only for [direct creator uploads](/images/upload-images/direct-creator-upload/).

To receive notifications for direct creator uploads:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Navigate to **Notifications** > **Destinations**.
3. From the Webhooks card, select **Create**.
4. Enter information for your webhook and select **Save and Test**. The new webhook will appear in the **Webhooks** card and can be attached to notifications.
5. Next, navigate to **Notifications** > **All Notifications** and click **Add**.
6. Under the list of products, locate **Images** and select **Select**.
7. Give your notification a name and optional description.
8. Under the **Webhooks** field, select the webhook that you recently created.
9. Click **Save**.
