You can use [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/) to load Zaraz selectively on specific URLs or subdomains. Configuration Rules can also be used to block Zaraz from loading based on cookies, IP addresses or anything else related to a request.

Refer to [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/) documentation to learn more about this feature and how you can use it with Zaraz.

:::note


If you need to block one or more actions from firing in a tool, Cloudflare recommends you use [Blocking Triggers](/zaraz/advanced/blocking-triggers/) instead of Configuration Rules.
