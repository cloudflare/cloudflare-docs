Zaraz can work in real-time. In this mode, every change you make is instantly published. You can also enable [Preview & Publish mode](/zaraz/history/preview-mode/), which allows you to test your changes before you commit to them.

When enabling Preview & Publish mode, you will also have access to [Zaraz History](/zaraz/history/versions/). Zaraz History shows you a list of all the changes made to your settings, and allows you to revert to any previous settings.
