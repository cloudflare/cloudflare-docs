Some tools supported by Zaraz let you add fields in addition to the required field. Fields can usually be added either to a specific action, or to all the action within a tool, by adding the field as a **Default Field**.

## Add an additional field to a specific action

Adding an additional field to an action will attach it to this action only, and will not affect your other actions.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Select **Zaraz** > **Tools Configuration** > **Third-party tools**.
3. Locate the third-party tool with the action you want to add the additional field to, and select **Edit**.
4. Select the action you wish to modify.
5. Select **Add Field**.
6. Choose the desired field from the drop-down menu and select **Add**.
7. Enter the value you wish to pass to the action.
8. Select **Save**.

The new field will now be used in this event.

## Add an additional field to all actions in a tool

Adding an additional field to the tool sets it as a default field for all of the tool actions. It is the same as adding it to every action in the tool.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Select **Zaraz** > **Tools**.
3. Locate the third-party tool where you want to add the field, and select **Edit**.
4. Select **Settings** > **Add Field**.
5. Choose the desired field from the drop-down menu, and select **Add**.
6. Enter the value you wish to pass to all the actions in the tool.
7. Select **Save**.

The new field will now be attached to every action that belongs to the tool.
