Once you have set up a standalone Health Check including notification emails, use Health Check Analytics to debug possible origin issues.

To access health check analytics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Traffic** > **Health Check Analytics**.

You can evaluate origin uptime, latency, failure reason, and specific event logs:

* **Health Checks By Uptime**: Shows the percentage of uptime for individual origins over time.
* **Health Checks By Failure Reason**: Shows a breakdown of failures by the specific reason. See [common error code causes and solutions below](/health-checks/health-checks-analytics/#common-error-codes).
* **Health Checks By Latency**: Shows average latency – measured in round trip time — for individual origins over time.
* **Event Log**: Shows individual health check data.
  * Select each record for additional details on **Round trip time**, the **Failure Reason**, the **Average Waterfall** (showing chronological data about request stages), **Response status code**, and more.

## Set up alerts

You can configure alerts to notify you of any changes in your health check status.

## Common error codes

### TCP connection failed

#### Cause

Health Checks failed to establish a TCP connection to your origin server.

#### Solution

This typically occurs when there is a network failure between Cloudflare and your origin, and/or a firewall refuses to allow our connection. Ensure your network and firewall configurations are not interfering with traffic.

### HTTP timeout occurred

#### Cause

The origin failed to return an HTTP response within the timeout configured. This happens if you have the timeout set to a low number. For example, one to two seconds.

#### Solution

Cloudflare recommends increasing the HTTP response timeout to allow the origin server to respond.

### Response code mismatch error

#### Cause

Cloudflare receives an HTTP status code that does not match the values defined in the `expected_codes` property of your Health Check configuration.

#### Solution

Response codes must match the `expected_codes`. Confirm the values are correct by comparing the expected response codes and the status code received in the Event Log.

#### ​​Alternate cause

You may also see this issue if you have a Health Check configured to use HTTP connections and your origin server is redirecting to HTTPS. In this case, the response code will often be `301`, `302`, or `303`.

#### Solution

Change your Cloudflare Health Check configuration to use HTTPS or set the value of `follow_redirect` to `true` so that Cloudflare can resolve the correct status code.

### Response body mismatch error

#### Cause

The response body returns from your origin server and does not include the (case-insensitive) value of `expected_body` configured in your Health Check. 

:::note
We only read the first 10 KB of the response. If you return a larger response, and the `expected_body` is not in the first 10 KB, the Health Check will fail. 
:::

#### Solution

Ensure the `expected_body` is in the first 10 KB of the response body.
​​

### TLS untrusted certificate error

#### Cause

The certificate is not trusted by a public Certificate Authority (CA).

#### Solution

If you’re using a self-signed certificate, Cloudflare recommends either using a publicly trusted certificate or setting the `allow_insecure` property on your Health Check to `true`.

### TLS name mismatch error

#### Cause

Our Health Check (client) was not able to match a name on the server certificate to the hostname of the request.

#### Solution

Inspect your Health Check configuration to confirm that the `header` value set in the Cloudflare Health Check is correct.

### TLS protocol error

#### Cause

This error can occur if you are using an older version of TLS or your origin server is not configured for HTTPS.

#### Solution

Ensure that your origin server supports TLS 1.2 or greater and is configured for HTTPS.

### TLS unrecognized name error

#### Cause

The server did not recognize the name provided by the client. When a host header is set, this is set as the ServerName in the initial TLS handshake. If it is not set, Cloudflare will not provide a ServerName, which can cause this error.

#### Solution

Set the host header in your Health Check object.

### ​​No route to host error

#### Cause

The IP address cannot be reached from Cloudflare’s network. Common causes are ISP or hosting provider network issues (e.g. BGP level), or that the IP does not exist.

#### Solution

Ensure IP is accurate, and check if there is an ISP or hosting provider network issue.

### TCP Timeout

#### Cause

Data transmission was not acknowledged and the retransmit of data did not succeed.

#### Solution

Confirm whether the SYN-ACK for the handshake takes place at your origin and contact [Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).

### ​​Network Unreachable

#### Cause

Cloudflare cannot connect to the origin web server due to network unavailability. This is usually caused by a network issue or incorrect origin IP.

#### Solution

Check the IP entered for the origin in Cloudflare’s Health Checks configuration or the IP returned via DNS for the origin hostname.

### HTTP Invalid Response

#### Cause

Usually caused by an HTTP 502 error or bad gateway.

#### Solution

Ensure the origin web server responds to requests and that no applications have crashed or are under high load.

### DNS Unknown Host

#### Cause

The origin web server hostname does not exist.

#### Solution

Confirm the origin web server resolves to an IP address.

### Connection Reset by Peer

#### Cause

A network error occurred while the client received data from the origin web server.

#### Solution

Confirm whether the origin web server is experiencing a high amount of traffic or an error.

### Monitor Configuration Error

#### Cause

There was a configuration error in the Health Check and no checks were run against the origin.

#### Solution

Review your Health Check configuration to ensure it matches an expected request to your origin.

### ​​DNS Internal

#### Cause

The origin web server’s hostname resolves to an internal or restricted address. No checks are run against this origin.

#### Solution

Cloudflare does not allow use of an origin web server hostname that resolves to a Cloudflare IP.

### Other Failure

#### Cause

If the failure cannot be classified as any other type of failure mentioned above.

#### Solution

Contact [Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).
