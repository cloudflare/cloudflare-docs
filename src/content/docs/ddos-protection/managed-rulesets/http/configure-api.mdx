import { Details, Render } from "~/components";

Configure the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset by defining overrides using the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/).

Each zone has the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset enabled by default. This means that you do not need to deploy the managed ruleset to the `ddos_l7` phase ruleset explicitly. You only have to create a rule in the phase ruleset to deploy the managed ruleset if you need to configure overrides.

## Configure an override for the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset

Use overrides to configure the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset. Overrides allow you to define a different action or sensitivity level from the default values. For more information on the available action and sensitivity level values, refer to [Ruleset parameters](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/http/override-parameters/).

Overrides can have a ruleset, tag, or rule scope. Tag and rule configurations have greater priority than ruleset configurations.

You can create overrides at the zone level and at the account level. Account-level overrides allow you to apply the same override to several zones in your account with a single rule. For example, you can use an account-level override to lower the sensitivity of a specific managed ruleset rule or exclude an [IP list](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#lists-with-ip-addresses-ip-lists) for multiple zones. However, if a given zone has overrides for the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset, the account-level overrides will not be evaluated for that zone.

:::caution[Important]

- The HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset is always enabled — you cannot disable its rules using an override with `"enabled": false`.
- <Render file="managed-rulesets/read-only-rules-note" />
- If you configure both account-level and zone-level overrides, only the zone-level overrides (the most specific ones) will be evaluated.
- Currently, account-level overrides for the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset are only available via API.

:::

### Creating multiple rules

:::note
Only available to Enterprise customers with the Advanced DDoS Protection subscription, which can create up to 10 rules.

## Example API calls

### Zone-level configuration example

The following `PUT` example creates a new phase ruleset (or updates the existing one) for the `ddos_l7` phase at the zone level. The request includes several overrides to adjust the default behavior of the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset. These overrides are the following:

- All rules of the managed ruleset will use the `managed_challenge` action and have a sensitivity level of `medium`.
- All rules tagged with `<TAG_NAME>` will have a sensitivity level of `low`.
- The rule with ID `<MANAGED_RULESET_RULE_ID>` will use the `block` action.

```bash title="Request"
curl --request PUT \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/ddos_l7/entrypoint \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "description": "Execute HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset in the zone-level phase entry point ruleset",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "execute",
      "action_parameters": {
        "id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
        "overrides": {
          "sensitivity_level": "medium",
          "action": "managed_challenge",
          "categories": [
            {
              "category": "<TAG_NAME>",
              "sensitivity_level": "low"
            }
          ],
          "rules": [
            {
              "id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_RULE_ID>",
              "action": "block"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "expression": "true"
    }
  ]
}'
```

The response returns the created (or updated) phase entry point ruleset.

### Account-level configuration example

The following `PUT` example creates a new phase ruleset (or updates the existing one) for the `ddos_l7` phase at the account level. The example defines a single rule override for requests coming from IP addresses in the `allowlisted_ips` [IP list](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#lists-with-ip-addresses-ip-lists), with the following configuration:

- The rule with ID `<MANAGED_RULESET_RULE_ID>`, belonging to the HTTP DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset (with ID `<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>`), will have an `eoff` (_Essentially Off_) sensitivity level and it will perform a `log` action.

:::note
Custom rule expressions (different from `"true"`) and the `log` action require an Enterprise plan with the Advanced DDoS Protection subscription.
