import { Details, Render } from "~/components"

Configure the Cloudflare Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset by defining overrides at the account level using the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/).

Each account has the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset enabled by default. This means that you do not need to deploy the managed ruleset to the `ddos_l4` phase entry point ruleset explicitly. You only have to create a rule in the phase entry point to deploy the managed ruleset if you need to configure overrides.

## Configure an override for the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset

You can define overrides at the ruleset, tag, and rule level for all managed rulesets.

When configuring the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset, use overrides to define a different **action** or **sensitivity** from the default values. For more information on these rule parameters and the allowed values, refer to [Managed ruleset parameters](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/network/override-parameters/).

:::caution[Important]

- The Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset is always enabled. You cannot disable its rules using an override with `"enabled": false`.
- <Render file="managed-rulesets/read-only-rules-note" />
- You can only define overrides for the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset at the account level. 
:::

## Example

The following `PUT` example creates a new phase ruleset (or updates the existing one) for the `ddos_l4` phase at the account level. The request includes several overrides to adjust the default behavior of the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset. These overrides are the following:

- All rules of the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset will have their sensitivity set to `medium`.
- All rules tagged with `<TAG_NAME>` will have their sensitivity set to `low`.
- The rule with ID `<MANAGED_RULESET_RULE_ID>` will use the `block` action.

The overrides apply to all packets matching the rule expression: `ip.dst in { 1.1.1.0/24 }`.

        "overrides": {
          "sensitivity_level": "medium",

              "category": "<TAG_NAME>",
              "sensitivity_level": "low"
            }
          ],
          "rules": [
            {
              "id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_RULE_ID>",
              "action": "block"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

The response returns the created (or updated) phase entry point ruleset.
