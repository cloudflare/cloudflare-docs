The [DDoS Attack Protection managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/) provide protection against a variety of <GlossaryTooltip term="distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack">DDoS attacks</GlossaryTooltip> across L3/4 (layers 3/4) and L7 of the OSI model. Cloudflare constantly updates these managed rulesets to improve the attack coverage, increase the mitigation consistency, cover new and emerging threats, and ensure cost-efficient mitigations.

[Advanced TCP Protection](/ddos-protection/tcp-protection/) and [Advanced DNS Protection](/ddos-protection/dns-protection/), available to [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/) customers, provide additional protection against sophisticated TCP-based DDoS attacks and sophisticated and fully randomized DNS attacks, respectively.

As a general guideline, various Cloudflare products operate on different open systems interconnection (OSI) layers and you are protected up to the layer on which your service operates. You can customize the DDoS settings on the layer in which you onboarded. For example, since the CDN/WAF service is a Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) service, Cloudflare provides protection from DDoS attacks on L7 downwards, including L3/4 attacks.

:::note

For Magic Transit customers, Cloudflare provides some L7 protection with a L3 service (like the Advanced DNS Protection system that is available for Magic Transit customers. DNS is considered a L7 protocol).

## Getting additional DNS protection

The Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed ruleset provides protection against some types of DNS attacks.

Magic Transit customers have access to [Advanced DNS Protection](/ddos-protection/dns-protection/) <InlineBadge preset="beta" />. Other customers might consider the following options:

- Use Cloudflare as your authoritative DNS provider ([primary DNS](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) or [secondary DNS](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/)).
- If you are running your own <GlossaryTooltip term="nameserver">nameservers</GlossaryTooltip>, use [DNS Firewall](/dns/dns-firewall/) to get additional protection against DNS attacks like random prefix attacks.
