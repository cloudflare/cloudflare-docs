# Configuring Advanced DNS Protection via API

Use the [Cloudflare API](/api/) to configure Advanced DNS Protection via API.

For examples of API calls, refer to [Common API calls](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/api/dns-protection/examples/).

## Endpoints

To obtain the complete endpoint, append the Advanced DNS Protection API endpoints listed below to the Cloudflare API base URL:
