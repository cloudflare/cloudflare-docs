To exclude a prefix or a prefix subset from Advanced DDoS Protection:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to **L3/4 DDoS** > **Advanced Protection**.
3. [Add the prefix](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/how-to/add-prefix/) you previously onboarded to Magic Transit to Advanced TCP Protection.
4. [Add the prefix](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/how-to/add-prefix/) (or subset) you wish to exclude as a new, separate prefix in Advanced TCP Protection.
5. For the prefix you added in the previous step, select **Exclude Subset** in the **Enrolled Prefixes** list.
