Advanced DDoS Protection systems are configured using the general settings, [Advanced TCP Protection](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-tcp-protection/), and [Advanced DNS Protection](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-dns-protection/).

## General settings

General settings enable and control the use of the Advanced TCP Protection and the Advanced DNS Protection systems, and are composed of thresholds, prefixes, rules, and enablement. To configure the general settings, refer to [Setup](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/setup/).

### Thresholds

Thresholds are based on your network's unique traffic, they define the sensitivity levels, and are configured by Cloudflare.

### Prefixes

Add prefixes to instruct the system on which traffic to route through the system.

### Rules

Create rules for the TCP and DNS Protection systems to enable mitigation. Start with Monitoring mode.

### Enablement

Enable the Advanced DDoS system and begin routing traffic through it.
