After onboarding to Cloudflare, you may want to simulate DDoS attacks against your Internet properties to test the protection, [reporting](/ddos-protection/reference/reports/), and [alerting](/ddos-protection/reference/alerts/) mechanisms. Follow the guidelines in this section to simulate a DDoS attack.

You can only launch DDoS attacks against your own Internet properties — your zone, Spectrum application, or IP range (depending on your Cloudflare services) — and provided that:

* The Internet properties are not shared with other organizations or individuals.
* The Internet properties have been onboarded to Cloudflare in an account under your name or ownership.

## Before you start

You do not have to obtain permission from Cloudflare to launch a DDoS attack simulation against your own Internet properties. However, before launching the simulated attack, you must [open a Support ticket](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) and provide the information below. All fields are mandatory.
