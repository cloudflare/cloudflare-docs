import { Steps, FileTree } from "~/components";

## Labels

Labels are controlled by frontmatter properties on a given page, which vary depending on if you are configuring a group or a link.

### Links

In order of precedence:

<Steps>

1. `sidebar.label`
2. `title`

</Steps>

#### On an index page

Index page labels default to `Overview` if `sidebar.label` is not defined.

`title` is not taken into consideration due to `title` being used in group labelling.

### Groups

In order of precedence:

<Steps>

1. `sidebar.group.label`
2. `title`

</Steps>

### Example

For example, given the following pages:

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/foo/bar/index.mdx"
---
title: Bar
sidebar:
  label: IndexTitle
  group:
    label: GroupTitle
---
```

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/foo/bar/baz.mdx"
---
title: Baz
sidebar:
  label: PageTitle
---
```

The sidebar structure will look like:

<FileTree>

- GroupTitle
  - IndexTitle
  - PageTitle

</FileTree>

If we remove the `sidebar` property from both, it will now look like this:

<FileTree>

- Bar
  - Overview
  - Baz

</FileTree>

## Ordering

Both links and groups use the `sidebar.order` frontmatter property to configure their ordering, where groups are ordered based on the index page's order.

If `sidebar.order` is not specified, it will fallback to alphabetical ordering.

For example, given the following pages:

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/foo/alpha/index.mdx"
---
title: Alpha
sidebar:
  order: 3
---
```

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/foo/beta/index.mdx"
---
title: Beta
sidebar:
  order: 2
---
```

The sidebar structure will look like:

<FileTree>

- Beta
  - ...
- Alpha
  - ...

</FileTree>

If we remove the `sidebar` property from both, it will now look like this:

<FileTree>

- Alpha
  - ...
- Beta
  - ...

</FileTree>

## Hiding pages

There are three properties that can be used for hiding pages from the sidebar.

### Hiding individual pages

#### `hidden`

This property should only be used when the page is **not** an index page for a group.

```mdx
---
title: Placeholder
sidebar:
  hidden: true
---
```

#### `group.hideIndex`

Since index pages are relied on to configure the label and sort order of groups, we have a special property that still makes the page available to our sidebar component and allows us to remove it after labelling and ordering groups.

```mdx
---
title: Placeholder
sidebar:
  group:
    hideIndex: true
---

import { DirectoryListing } from "~/components";

<DirectoryListing />
```

:::note

Since these pages are still accessible via other links and directly navigating to the URL, always include a `DirectoryListing` component within the page content.

:::

### Hiding child pages of a group

To make a group render as if it was a single page, which links to the index page, use the top-level `hideChildren` property.

## Badges

### Links

To specify a badge next to the link, use the `sidebar.badge` property.

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/examples/example.mdx"
---
title: Example
sidebar:
  badge: New!
---
```

<FileTree>

- Examples
  - Example [New!]

</FileTree>

### Groups

To specify a badge next to the group label, use the `sidebar.group.badge` inside the group's `index.mdx` frontmatter.

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/examples/index.mdx"
---
title: Examples
sidebar:
  group:
    badge: New!
---
```

<FileTree>

- Examples [New!]
  - Example

</FileTree>
