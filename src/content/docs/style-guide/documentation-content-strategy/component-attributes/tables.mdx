title: Tables

---

Tables make complex information easier to understand by presenting it in a clear structure.

:::caution


Limit tables to three columns (or four if the information is very condensed). Otherwise, mobile users will have a hard time consuming tabular information.


:::

## Use cases

Use tables for:

* Simple mappings of data and values
* Categories of things with examples
* Collections of things with different attributes

## Usage

We use standard Markdown tables for our documentation.

### Example

| Category             | Range                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not computed**     | Bot scores of 0.                                                                       |
| **Automated**        | Bot scores of 1.                                                                       |
| **Likely automated** | Bot scores of 2 through 29.                                                            |
| **Likely human**     | Bot scores of 30 through 99.                                                           |
| **Verified bot**     | Non-malicious automated traffic (used to power search engines and other applications). |

```txt title="Markdown table"
| Category | Range |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Not computed** | Bot scores of 0. |
| **Automated** | Bot scores of 1. |
| **Likely automated** | Bot scores of 2 through 29. |
| **Likely human** | Bot scores of 30 through 99. |
| **Verified bot** | Non-malicious automated traffic (used to power search engines and other applications). |
```

### Guidelines

When using tables:

* Check whether the tables work for both desktop and mobile users.
* Limit tables to three columns (or four if the information is very condensed).
* Avoid long sentences or information that is so dense that it defeats the purpose of having tabular displays.

### Alternatives

If your information does not fit within the [guidelines](#guidelines), consider using the following methods of presentation:

* Lists
* Subsections
* Tabs

### Large tables

As stated in the [guidelines](#guidelines), we generally avoid large tables in our documentation.

However, if you have a unique use case, use the `{{</*table-wrap*/>}}` shortcode to make your table responsive and scrollable.

<table-wrap>

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| test     | test     | test     | test     |

</table-wrap>

```txt title="table-wrap example"
{{</*table-wrap*/>}}

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| test | test | test | test |

{{</*/table-wrap*/>}}
```
