## Definition

## Used in

Glossary, documentation pages, tooltips.

## Structure

### Data

The data underlying our glossary lives with YAML files in the [`/src/content/glossary/*`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/tree/production/src/content/glossary) folder.

Each file should be structured similar to the following:

```yaml title="dns.yaml"
---
productName: DNS
entries:
  - term: active zone
    general_definition: |-
      a DNS zone that is active on Cloudflare requires changing its nameservers to Cloudflare's for management.
    associated_products:
      - Cloudflare One

  - term: apex domain
    general_definition: |-
      apex domain is used to refer to a domain that does not contain a subdomain part, such as `example.com` (without `www.`). It is also known as "root domain" or "naked domain".

  - term: DNS over HTTPS
    general_definition: |-
      DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a standard for encrypting DNS traffic, preventing tracking and spoofing of DNS queries.
    associated_products:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - Cloudflare One

  - term: DNS over TLS
    general_definition: |-
      DNS over TLS (DoT) is a standard for encrypting DNS traffic using its own port (853) and TLS encryption.
    associated_products:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - Cloudflare One
```

Relevant values include the following:

- `productName` string required

  - Core product associated with this file. Should always match the same formatting / styling used in `associated_products`.

- `entries` object required

  - `term` string required

    - The glossary term itself.

  - `general_definition` string required

    - Definition of the term. Should be general enough to apply to multiple products. Should also start with a lowercase letter unless starting with a proper noun.

  - `associated_products` array optional

    - If the term is associated with other products. Any names used should correspond to the `productName` of that associated file.

### Usage

Because of the [structured data](#data) associated with our glossaries, we can pull these terms into multiple places.

#### Product-level glossary

A product-level glossary includes all terms associated with a particular product, which will pull in terms directly in that product's glossary file and any terms that include the product in its `associated_products`.

```mdx title="/src/content/docs/dns/glossary.mdx"
---
title: Glossary
pcx_content_type: glossary
---

import { Glossary } from "~/components";

Review the definitions for terms used across Cloudflare's DNS documentation.

<Glossary product="dns" />
```

#### Glossary definition

Pull glossary definitions directly into your Markdown by using the `<GlossaryDefinition>` component.

> <GlossaryDefinition term="active zone" />

Is a quoted definition that comes from:

```mdx
<GlossaryDefinition term="active zone" prepend="An active zone is " />
```

Properties are:

- `term` string required

  - Should match a term within an existing glossary YAML file.

- `prepend` string optional

  - Text to add before a definition.

#### Glossary tooltip

Pull component definitions into a focusable tooltip for a specific phrase by using the `<GlossaryTooltip>` component.

Here's a <GlossaryTooltip term="active zone">tooltip</GlossaryTooltip> example.

```mdx
Here's a <GlossaryTooltip term="active zone">tooltip</GlossaryTooltip> example.
```

Properties are:

- `term` string required

  - Should match a term within an existing glossary YAML file.

- `prepend` string optional

  - Text to add before a definition.

- `link` string optional

  - Wraps the inner text in a markdown link, similar to normal markdown formatting.

Because of space limitations, the tooltip will always default to the short definition of a term, meaning the definition text before the first line break.
