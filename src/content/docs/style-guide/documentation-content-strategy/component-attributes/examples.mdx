## Definition

A code sample or line of text that shows the specific structure of a request/response, input/output, or value for UI/API elements

:::note


If you are unsure about when to categorize something as an example or tutorial, remember:

Examples are a component attribute and are typically a snippet of code a user might copy and paste to run a task. Examples should not have multiple steps. A tutorial might contain an example, but an example will not contain a tutorial.

Tutorials are a content type, typically longer form, and contain multiple steps to help users connect products to real-world scenarios.
