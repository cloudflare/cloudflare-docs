title: Get started

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Get started content is to help users go from not using a product to successfully configuring and setting up.

## content\_type

`get-started`

## Structure

### Required components

[**Title**](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/titles/): Should be "Get started"

[**Prerequisites**](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/prerequisites/): Which may include:

* An active zone
* Certain subscription / enabled product / plan
* Other tasks you might need to do to set up other things (your origin) outside of CF
* Do you need to make certain decisions before you start?

[**Steps**](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/): Steps that lead someone to whatever would be considered Product Adoption.

* Often, these can be partialized files from your How-to pages.
* This is usually the bare minimum (a single Bot Management FW rule) + the most general use case for a product.
* This may at times contradict the flow in the Cloudflare dashboard at times. If it does, consider raising it up to the Product team.

### Optional components

**Next steps**: Point someone towards additional configuration options.
