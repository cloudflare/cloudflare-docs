## Structure

The structure of a page within the support tile will depend on the purpose that content serves.

## Boundaries

The general guidance is that anything related to a specific product (DNS, Security Center) or platform (Cloudflare One) belongs in a [product](/products/) tile. Anything that is specific to interacting with Cloudflare support or details niche troubleshooting steps belongs in the [support](/support/) tile.

Support content should not duplicate content that already exists in a product tile.

    <tr>
        <th style="width:50%">Support content examples</th>
        <th>Product content examples</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>How to interact with Cloudflare support</td>
        <td>Product documentation - feature information, functionality, configuration, known limitations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Niche troubleshooting information (multiple product configurations affecting each other)</td>
        <td>Troubleshooting a specific product or platform</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Third-party integrations and partnerships that are not specific to a product (like WordPress)</td>
        <td>Product-specific integration guides</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Runtime errors when integrating with external products</td>
        <td>Runtime errors specific to a product</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>How Cloudflare charges for specific things (rates, usage)</td>
        <td>Process documentation for how to set up billing information, etc. - no pricing content</td>
    </tr>
