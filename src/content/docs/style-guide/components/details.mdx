title: Details
---

When you want to provide additional information in context, but you do not want it to clutter up the more important content, use `<Details>` to add a collapsible container.

```mdx live
import { Details } from "~/components"

<Details header="Open me!">
    Hello, world!
</Details>
```

You can specify the default configuration of each instance of the `<Details>` component (that is, whether it is open or closed by default).

```mdx live
import { Details } from "~/components"

<Details header="Close me!" open = {true}>
    Long piece of code example.
</Details>
```
