title: Code blocks
---

Code blocks are powered by [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/), a project by Astro.
This is just a small showcase of functionality, it has a lot of options!

````mdx live
```powershell title="PowerShell"
Write-Output "This one has a title!"
```

```js wrap
// Example with wrap
function getLongString() {
	return "This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide";
}
```

```js "return true;" ins="inserted" del="deleted"
function demo() {
	console.log("These are inserted and deleted marker types");
	// The return statement uses the default marker type
	return true;
}
```

```diff lang="js"
  function thisIsJavaScript() {
    // This entire block gets highlighted as JavaScript,
    // and we can still add diff markers to it!
-   console.log('Old code to be removed')
+   console.log('New and shiny code!')
  }
```
````

:::caution
Do not use the `$` sign in your code blocks before the command.

## Output

If you would like to include the output of your code block, create a second code block below and add the `output` property to the opening code fence.

```sh
npx wrangler vectorize create tutorial-index --dimensions=3 --metric=cosine
```

```sh output
✅ Successfully created index 'tutorial-index'

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX" # available in your Worker on env.VECTORIZE_INDEX
index_name = "tutorial-index"
```

````mdx
```sh
npx wrangler vectorize create tutorial-index --dimensions=3 --metric=cosine
```

```sh output
✅ Successfully created index 'tutorial-index'

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX" # available in your Worker on env.VECTORIZE_INDEX
index_name = "tutorial-index"
```
````

## Playground

If you add the `playground` option to the opening code fence for a Worker example, it will
add a "Run Worker in Playground" link that will take the user to the [Worker's playground](/workers/playground/)

```js playground
export default {
	fetch() {
		return new Response("Test!");
	},
};
```

````mdx
```js playground
export default {
	fetch() {
		return new Response("Test!");
	},
};
```
````

## TypeScript examples

The `TypeScriptExample` component uses [`detype`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detype) to remove TypeScript-specific syntax from your example and provide a JavaScript tab. This reduces maintenance burden by only having a single example to maintain.

### Input

* `filename` `string | { js: string, ts: string }` (optional)
  * If a single TypeScript filename is passed, this will be used for JavaScript but with a `.js` file extension.
    * `<TypeScriptExample filename="example.ts">`
  * To specify different filenames for the two languages, pass an object with a `js` and `ts` filename including extensions.
    * `<TypeScriptExample filename={{ js: "foo.js", ts: "bar.ts" }}>`
* `tabsWrapper` `boolean` (optional)
  * When set to `false`, this component will not render `<Tabs>` components.
    * This allows you to include the JS/TS tabs in your own `<Tabs>` and add `<TabItem>`s before/after, i.e for Python examples.
* `playground` `boolean` (optional)
  * When set to `true`, a "Open Worker in Playground" link will render on the JavaScript codeblock.

````mdx live
import { TypeScriptExample } from "~/components";

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
interface Environment {
  KV: KVNamespace;
}

export default {
  async fetch(req, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    if (req !== "POST") {
        return new Response("Method Not Allowed", {
            status: 405,
            headers: {
                "Allow": "POST"
            }
        });
    }

    await env.KV.put("foo", "bar");

    return new Response();
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Environment>
```
