All of the components available to contributors writing content on Cloudflare's developer documentation
are documented in this section.

## What is a component?

[Astro components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/) are re-usable HTML templates which
we use to reduce maintenance burden & duplicated code by returning frequently used layouts or snippets into
a component that can be imported and used across various pages.

## Using components

Content is authored in [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/), which allows JavaScript
expressions and components to be used. They are like HTML elements, which can be self-closing.

```mdx live
import { Details, RuleID } from "~/components"

{/* Self-closing component */}
<RuleID id="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" />

<br/> {/* Line break to separate rendered components */}

{/* Component with inside content */}
<Details header="Open me!">
    Hello, world!
</Details>
```

### Importing

Components need to be imported to be made available inside a MDX file. All of our components are exported from
`"~/components"`, so they would be imported like this:

```mdx
import { Card, Render } from "~/components"
```
