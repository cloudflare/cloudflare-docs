There are two icon components which pull from two different icon sets.

## astro-icon

The [`astro-icon`](https://www.astroicon.dev/) package is available to use as a standalone component.

Primarily, this is used for Cloudflare product icons which are stored in `/src/icons/*.svg`.

```mdx live
import { AstroIcon } from "~/components";

<AstroIcon name="workers" class="text-orange-400 text-5xl" />
```

## Starlight

The Starlight icon set is available to use in `Tab`, `Card` and other Starlight components.

```mdx live
import { StarlightIcon } from "~/components";

<StarlightIcon name="seti:shell" color="var(--sl-color-text-accent)" size="3rem" />
```
