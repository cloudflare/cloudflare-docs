import { Badge } from "~/components";

Badges are a built-in component provided by [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#bades). Use them to indicate a product is in beta, for example.

:::note

For guidance on using badges inline with other text, refer to [Inline badges](/style-guide/components/inline-badge/).

## Component

```mdx live
import { Badge } from "~/components";

<Badge text="New" variant="tip" size="small" />
<Badge text="Deprecated" variant="caution" size="medium" />
<Badge text="Starlight" variant="note" size="large" />
<Badge text="Custom" variant="success" style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }} />
```

## Sidebar

Badges can be added to the sidebar via page frontmatter.

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
sidebar:
  badge:
    variant: tip
    text: New
---
```

If you want to add the Beta badge to a product, omit the `variant:` entry:

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
sidebar:
  badge:
    text: Beta
---
```
