title: Render
---

import { Steps } from "~/components";

The `Render` component allows us to include a "partial", a reusable Markdown snippet, onto a page.

It also accepts parameters that can be used as variables within the partial, so that even content
which needs slight differences between usages can be turned into a partial.

## Component

```mdx live
import { Render } from "~/components";

<Render file="hello" params={{
    name: "world",
    link: "/style-guide/components/render/"
}} />
{/*
Hello, {props.name}!

Hello `{props.name}`

Hello <code>{props.name}</code>

[link]({props.link})

<a href={props.link}>link</a>
*/}
```

### Inputs

**file** `string`: This should be the name of the partial, without the containing directory or file extension.
For example, `/partials/style-guide/hello.mdx` would be `file="hello"`.

**product** `string` (optional): By default, it will look for partials in the same product folder as the current page.
You can use this to specify a different product.

**params** `object` (optional): If you wish to substitute values inside your partial, you can use pass params which can be
referenced in your partial. Refer to [params](#params).

## Partials

Partials only have one optional frontmatter property, which is `params`. This takes an array of strings,
which should be the expected parameters. When this is defined, but those parameters are not passed, an error
will be thrown.

```mdx title="/src/content/partials/style-guide/hello.mdx"
---
params:
  - name
  - foo
  - bar
---

Hello, {props.name}!

Hello, {props.foo}!

Hello, {props.bar}!
```

### Params

In the above example, you will notice there is:

<Steps>
	1. A `params` input on the `Render` component 2. A `params` property in the
	frontmatter. 3. A reference to `props.name`.
</Steps>

#### Input

When using the `params` input on the `Render` component, you can write a [JavaScript object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_objects)
which is later available inside the partial.

#### Frontmatter

The `params` frontmatter property on a partial expects an array of strings, containing the "expected parameters". This is so that if
your partial requires parameters to be passed, and none are passed, we can warn the user.

#### Props

The way that you can access these parameters is with the `props` object, surrounded in curly braces `{}`.
This is a [JavaScript expression within MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/#props).
