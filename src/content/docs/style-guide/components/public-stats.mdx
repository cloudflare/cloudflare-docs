The `PublicStats` component allows you to reference specific values about Cloudflare's network without maintaining those values in multiple files.

Refer to the examples below for more information.

```mdx live
import { PublicStats } from "~/components";

Cloudflare has data centers in <PublicStats id="data_center_cities" />.

Our network has <PublicStats id="total_bandwidth" />.

Cloudflare also has <PublicStats id="network_peers" />.
```

:::note

If you need more stats or to update these stats, submit a pull request to update [PublicStats.astro](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/blob/production/src/components/PublicStats.astro)
