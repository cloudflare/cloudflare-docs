title: Directory listing
---

Use `<DirectoryListing />` to display the directory of a specific folder, which appears as a list of links.

We also have an optional `descriptions` parameter which - if present - adds in the text from the [front matter `description`](/style-guide/frontmatter/) field.

```mdx live
import { DirectoryListing } from "~/components";

<DirectoryListing folder="workers/wrangler" descriptions />
```
