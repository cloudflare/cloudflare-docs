title: Anchor heading
---

The `AnchorHeading` component emulates the behaviour of the [`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) and [`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) plugins.

It adds an `id` based on the output of [`github-slugger`](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger/) to the heading, as well as adding a button to copy a link to that particular heading.

This is only required when writing headings yourself inside components, Markdown (including partials) will have this applied via the aforementioned rehype plugins.

```mdx live
import { AnchorHeading } from "~/components"

<AnchorHeading title="Foo & Bar & Baz" depth={2} />
```
