title: Anchor heading
---

The `AnchorHeading` component defines headings. Specifically, `AnchorHeading` performs the following:

1. Generates URL fragments corresponding to headings.
2. Formats URL fragments into compatible syntax. For example, a `&` is replaced with a `-`.
3. Creates a button to copy the URL at each fragment.
4. Allows heading fragments to be defined separately from the text of the heading itself.

```mdx live
import { AnchorHeading } from "~/components";

<AnchorHeading title="How to use AnchorHeading" slug="use-anchorheading" depth={2} />
```

By default, markdown files (including partials) have this behavior applied via rehype plugins. Therefore, the `AnchorHeading` component is usually only required when writing headings yourself inside components, or when working on non-markdown files.

Additionally, `AnchorHeading`s are useful when rendering partial files into one location where there are duplicate headings (for example, when there are multiple H3 "`create`" headings in one page). `AnchorHeading`'s ability to explicitly define a fragment allows you to ensure each heading can be linked correctly with unique fragments.

:::note

The `AnchorHeading` component emulates the behavior of the [`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug) and the [`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings). It adds an `id` based on the output of [`github-slugger`](https://github.com/Flet/github-slugger/) to the heading, as well as adding a button to copy a link to that particular heading.
