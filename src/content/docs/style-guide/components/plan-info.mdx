title: Plan info
---
Use when you need a single piece of information from the `index.json` file in `src/content/plans/`. For the id property, use dot notation to access the property you want to share.

```mdx live
import { PlanInfo } from "~/components"

<PlanInfo id="web3.ethereum.properties.availability.summary" />
```
