title: List examples
---

```mdx live
import { ListExamples } from "~/components";

<ListExamples directory="rules/snippets/examples" />
```

There are also two optional, additional properties:

- `filters` `string[]`: A list of filters to render that helps someone filter the examples based on values in the frontmatter.
- `additionalProducts` `string[]`: A list of additional product examples to look across our docs for. Looks for anything matching the `products` frontmatter in examples across other areas of the docs.
