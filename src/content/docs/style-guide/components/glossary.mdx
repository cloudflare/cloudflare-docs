title: Glossary
---

Use the glossary definition shortcode to render the defined glossary definition. Additionally, you can include a [prepend value](/style-guide/components/glossary-definition/) to add words to the start of the definition.

Create the glossary entries in a file dedicated to your product. These YAML files live in `/src/content/glossary/<YOUR-PRODUCT>.yaml`

## Component

```mdx live
import { Glossary } from "~/components"

<Glossary />
```

## Glossary

import { Code } from "~/components"
import glossary from "~/content/glossary/style-guide.yaml?raw"

<Code title="/src/content/glossary/style-guide.yaml" code={glossary} lang="yaml" />
