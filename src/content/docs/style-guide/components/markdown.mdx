title: Markdown
---

This component uses `marked` to turn the `text` prop into HTML. This is useful with, for example partial files that have variables you need to format.

```mdx live
import { Markdown } from "~/components";

<Markdown text="**foo** <br/> [bar](/style-guide/components/markdown/)" />
```

## Example for variables in partials

If you have a variable that needs to be formatted in any special way (for example, it needs to be a URL, an unordered list, or something else), you can wrap the variable with the markdown component in your partial file. For example:

```mdx
<Markdown text={props.foo} />
```

Note that you need to wrap your variabble in curly braces, as well as use `text=` or this will not work.
