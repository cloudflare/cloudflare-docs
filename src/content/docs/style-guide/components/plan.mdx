title: Plan
---

The plan component lets you define what type of plan your product needs. There are two ways to use it: in the main [Overview page](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/content-types/overview/) of your product, or in a page where you need to talk about a specific feature with additional requirements.

In the Overview page, use `<Plan type="<PLAN_TYPE>" />`
To specify a special feature use `<Plan id="<FIRST_PRODUCT>.<SECOND-PRODUCT>.properties.availability.summary" />`. This component pulls information from the `index.json` file in `src/content/plans/`.

Refer to the examples below for more information.


```mdx live
