There are three types of lists:

* Bulleted lists for unordered items
* Numbered lists for ordered items
* Embedded lists for items within a sentence

Here are some tips when creating lists:

* Keep list items parallel
* Start numbered lists with a command (imperative verb)
* Consistently punctuate by using appropriate sentence + punctuation within the list (periods for full sentences, etc.)

## Bullet points

Bullet points help the reader's eye focus on a list of important elements.

However, as with any other aspect of writing, they should be used mindfully. Below is a list of when you should and should not resort to bullet points.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>❌ Do not use bullet points</th>
        <th>✅ Use bullet points</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>To outline <b>processes</b> (prefer numbered lists)</td>
        <td>To list <b>facts</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>To explain your reasoning (it is a blog post, not a list of system requirements)</td>
        <td>To list <b>data</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>To list <b>options</b></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Bulleted lists

Instructions should be numbered steps and not bullet points. See [steps/tasks/procedures](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/) for additional information.

Do not punctuate bullet points unless each item is a full sentence.

If bullet point items are followed by a description, use a colon after the heading and capitalize the description. For example,

* **Item 1**: Description 1
* **Item 2**: Description 2

For bullet points, try to stick to the "six-pack" rule: no more than six bullets, each made up of six words or less.

Refer to [The best way to use bullet points](https://thewritinghabit.blog/2016/08/22/best-way-to-use-bullet-points/) for additional guidance.

### Bulleted list checklist

When you find yourself creating a list of bullet points, go through this checklist:

1. Do all bullet points belong together?
   * Check that all the elements in the list are logically connected.
2. Do I have more three or more bullet points, but less than six?
   * Readers get lost when reading long lists; at the same time, if you have less than three elements to list, is it necessary to use bullet points?
3. Are all bullet points shorter than three lines of text?
   * Bullet points should not be used as section headers. If you have excessively long bullet points, consider breaking up the list into several subsections.
4. Is punctuation consistent?
   * End all elements of a bulleted list with a period if each element is a full sentence; do not add any punctuation if you are just listing nouns or parameters.
5. Do all bullet points start with the most important word we want the reader to remember?
   * Make sure the "head" of your bullet point is not hiding after a long circumlocution.
6. Do all bullet points start with the same part of speech?
   * If your bullet points start with verbs, make sure all verbs are in the same mood/tense.
