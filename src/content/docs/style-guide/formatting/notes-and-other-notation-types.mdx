Use a **warning** to alert a reader to behavior that could impact the security of a users network or break functionality. You can call out product requirements, limitations, and specifications so that users see them loud and clearly.

Use a **note** to alert a reader to additional useful information that you cannot integrate into the text. You can provide context for a topic that would be a digression if added directly to the discussion at hand.

Refer to [notes/tips/warnings](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/notes-tips-warnings/) for details on the Markdown syntax.
