The API content strategy aims to:

* Reduce internal and external user frustration
* Align with industry standards in terms of naming conventions and descriptions
* Create world-class content that is just as good, or better, than very popular API documentation

By ensuring Cloudflare's API content is straightforward, easy to navigate, and consistent, we can create world-class API content that eliminates user frustration and serves as an example of good API documentation.
