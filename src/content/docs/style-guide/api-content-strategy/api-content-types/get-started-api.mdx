## Purpose

The Get started section provides a brief overview of the Cloudflare’s API and lists requirements and tasks users must complete before successfully making their first request.

## Structure

### Required components

**Overview**: High-level explanation of Cloudflare’s API and includes information about our architectural style, schema, and base URL.

**Authentication**: Explains how users can authenticate with the Cloudflare API and how users should or can utilize API tokens, API token templates, and API token permissions.

## Example

**Overview**: Cloudflare's API exposes the entire Cloudflare infrastructure via a standardized programmatic interface. Cloudflare’s API uses `REST` and returns `JSON` responses, and the latest version is `v4`.

**Recommended workflow**:

1. Sign up for a Cloudflare account.
2. Create an API token.
3. (Optional) Use API token templates and token permissions.
4. Make your first request.
