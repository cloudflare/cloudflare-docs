title: Dashes

---

Dashes look like hyphens, but are wider. An em dash is the widest type of dash. Dashes have a different purpose than hyphens. We use two types of dashes:

## Hyphen (-)

**Hyphenate compound modifiers that are placed before the noun.** Compound modifiers that come before the noun require a hyphen to distinguish them from individual modifiers and nouns. Do not hyphenate compound modifiers that come after the noun. Hyphens are used in compound words and to express ranges.

Examples:

* The most up-to-date software can be found here.

* It takes 24-48 hours for the data to upload.

:::note

Never include whitespaces around a hyphen.

| Protect your Internet property from common vulnerabilities with our enterprise-class Web Application Firewall (WAF). | Protect your Internet property from common vulnerabilities with our enterprise class Web Application Firewall (WAF). | ‘Enterprise-class’ refers to the ability of something to scale with and handle the needs of large enterprises. A hyphen is necessary because the compound modifier comes before the noun. |

## Em dash (—)

**Use em dashes to break up thoughts within a single sentence.** Em dashes (—) or double dashes (--) with spaces around them may be used to break up thoughts within a sentence. Single dashes (-), or hyphens, are commonly used to write compound words/modifiers and should never be used to break up thoughts in this way.

* Shortcut for Mac users: Hold down Shift and Option keys, then press the Minus key

* Shortcut for PC users: Hold down the Alt key and type 0151

Dashes are used in pairs (in place of parenthesis) or alone (in place of a semicolon or colon).

Examples:

* Cookies provide saved information about a user’s session to establish a “state” — in most cases, identity — as your browser makes a request.

* Embed yourself in the team — the best results will come when trust is built.

:::note

Following AP style guides, and to improve readability, we include whitespaces before and after the em dash.
