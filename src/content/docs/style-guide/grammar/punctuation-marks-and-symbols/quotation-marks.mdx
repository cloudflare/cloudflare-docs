title: Quotation marks

---

In general, avoid the `'s` construction to show possession by an inanimate object. Doing so personifies the object.

Example: the device's address.

## Usage

Do not use `“ ” ‘ ’`, which are double or single typographer's ("curly") quotation marks. Use standard quotation marks instead.
