title: Capitalization

---

**Capitalize names of Cloudflare products, services, and features.**

Each product, service, and feature should be properly spelled and capitalized when used in any content, both to ensure consistency across all channels and to differentiate common performance and security technologies (for example: load balancing, bot management, and web application firewalls) from specific Cloudflare solutions (for example: Cloudflare Load Balancing, Cloudflare Bot Management, and Cloudflare Web Application Firewall).

## Example of capitalization and pluralization usage for the Waiting Room

**When to use Waiting Room capitalized and singular:**

* Naming the product: *Waiting Room keeps wait times low by dynamically managing traffic.*
* Page title: *Access Waiting Room*
* Preceded by “Cloudflare”: *Cloudflare Waiting Room allows organizations to…*
* Preceding a feature name: *Waiting Room Event Scheduling*

**When to waiting room(s) lower-case and in singular or plural:**

* Used as an object: *Your waiting room will begin queueing all visitors and will not allow any visitors to the path protected by your waiting room.*
* Capitalize only the first word when at the beginning of a sentence:  *Waiting rooms are enabled on all subpaths, meaning you might be sending more traffic to your waiting room than anticipated.*
* Capitalize only the first word when it is the title of a subsection: *### Waiting room template*
