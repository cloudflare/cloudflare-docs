Delivery guarantees or "delivery modes" define how strongly a messaging system enforces the delivery of messages it processes. Each mode comes with a number of trade-offs. As you make stronger guarantees about message delivery, the system needs to perform more checks and acknowledgments to ensure that messages are delivered, or maintain state to ensure a message is only delivered the specified number of times. This increases the latency of the system and reduces the overall throughput of the system. Each "real" message may require an additional 2-4 messages, and an equivalent number of additional roundtrips, before it can be considered delivered.

Pub/Sub is based on the MQTT protocol, which allows per-message flexibility around delivery guarantees or [Quality of Service](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901234) in MQTT terms.

Ideal when message rates are fairly low and where latency is not a primary concern. <br/><br/>This is typically very rare, and QoS 2 naturally increases latency and reduces throughput due to the additional acknowledgement packets. You should only use QoS 2 if your publishers, subscribers, or persistency layer cannot be changed to handle idempotent inserts. |

## Determine the right delivery mode

Each mode comes with a number of trade-offs. As you make stronger guarantees about message delivery, the system needs to perform more checks and acknowledgments to ensure that messages are delivered or maintain state to ensure a message is only delivered the specified number of times. This increases the latency of the system and reduces the overall throughput of the system. Each "real" message may require an additional 2-4 messages and an equivalent number of additional roundtrips, before it can be considered delivered.

MQTT specifies delivery guarantees at a per-message (PUBLISH) level, rather than at a per-broker or per-topic level as some other messaging systems do.

* This allows additional flexibility. General metrics and telemetry data that can afford a small percentage of "lost" messages can be sent with QoS level 0 (at most once), which is the default.
  * For example, the loss of 5-10 messages over 1000 sensor readings is unlikely to impact subsequent data analysis, especially if the payload is small and the data superseded quickly by a subsequent reading.
* In other cases, however, such as when delivering a chat message to another user, or publishing transaction data to a central system, the ability to set a higher QoS level — QoS level 1 corresponding to "at least once" and QoS level 2 to "exactly once" — means that only those messages incur the additional overhead.
  For most use cases, QoS level 0 is ideal for high-volume telemetry or sensor data, where concrete acknowledgement of delivery is not required. For other cases, such as publishing transaction data, chat messages or user-facing notifications, QoS level 1 ("at least once") is recommended.
