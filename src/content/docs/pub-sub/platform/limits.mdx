Shorter client IDs are rejected with a CONNACK using Reason Code 0x85 (Client Identifier not valid). |
| Maximum Username Length                          | 32 bytes               | The maximum length of the username in bytes. <br/> Usernames are optional, but if provided, must match the Client ID. <br/> Invalid usernames are rejected with CONNACK using Reason Code 0x86 (Bad Username or Password).              |
