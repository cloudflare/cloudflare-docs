Available Notifications depend on your Cloudflare plan. Cloudflare offers a variety of Notifications for our products and services, such as [Billing](/fundamentals/subscriptions-and-billing/), [Denial of Service protection](/ddos-protection/), [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/), and [SSL/TLS](/ssl/).

Depending on your plan, you can also configure webhooks, allowing you to connect your account with external services such as Slack and Google Chat, and PagerDuty to receive Cloudflare Notifications.

## Actions available on receiving a Notification

Each Notification carries different types of information about the status of your Cloudflare account, or the type of action you can take.

Refer to information below to understand what each Notification does and what to do when receiving one.
