Cloudflare Notifications help you stay up to date with your Cloudflare account. Manage your Notifications to define what you want to be warned about and how, be it a denial-of-service attack or an issue with your server.

The available Notification features vary according to your plan:

- Free plans can set up email-based Notifications.
- Business and higher plans can also [access PagerDuty](/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/).
- Professional and higher plans can also [use webhooks](/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/).

The notification service only works on the [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) domains because Cloudflare needs enough information necessary to decide if we need to trigger a notification or not.

:::note

The availability of delivery methods like PagerDuty and webhooks in Free or Professional zones depends on the highest zone plan in your Cloudflare account:

- PagerDuty is available in zones on a Free/Professional plan if your Cloudflare account has at least one zone in a Business plan (or higher).
- Webhooks are available in zones on a Free plan if your Cloudflare account has at least one zone in a Professional plan (or higher).
