The list of notifications available depends on the type of account you have. Refer to [Available Notifications](/notifications/notification-available/) to learn more about what each notification does and what do to when receiving one.

You can check the [Notification History](/notifications/notification-history/) using the API to view notifications that have been generated for your account.

## Permissions

To create a notification via the Cloudflare dashboard, you will need to have the Super Administrator or Administrator role.

You can also create a notification if you have an edit role for the feature that you want to create an alert for. For example, if you want to create a Load Balancing Pool Enablement notification, you will need to have the Load Balancer role.

An API token needs to have the [Notifications Read/Write permission](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) to create a notification,
