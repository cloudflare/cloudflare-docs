---

A few common rate limiting configuration issues prevent proper request matches:

* **Including HTTP or HTTPS protocol schemes in rule patterns** (such as `https://example.com/*`). To restrict rules to match only HTTP or HTTPS traffic, use the schemes array in the request match. For example, `"schemes": [ "HTTPS" ]`.
* **Forgetting a trailing slash character (`/`)**. Cloudflare Rate Limiting only treats requests for the homepage (such as `example.com` and `example.com/`) as equivalent, but not any other path (such as `example.com/path/` and `example.com/path`). To match request paths both with and without the trailing slash, use a wildcard match (for example, `example.com/path*`).
* **Including a query string or anchor** (such as `example.com/path?foo=bar` or `example.com/path#section1`). A rule like `example.com/path` will match requests for `example.com/path?foo=bar`.
* **Overriding a rate limit with [IP Access rules](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/)**.
* **Including a port number** (such as `example.com:8443/api/`). Rate Limiting does not consider port numbers within rules. Remove the port number from the URL so that the rate limit rule triggers as expected.

## Common API errors

The following common errors may prevent configuring rate limiting rules via the [Cloudflare API](/api/operations/rate-limits-for-a-zone-create-a-rate-limit):  

* `Decoding is not yet implemented` – Indicates that your request is missing the `Content-Type: application/json` header. Add the header to your API request to fix the issue.
* `Ratelimit.api.not_entitled` – Enterprise customers must contact their account team before adding rules.

:::note

The `origin_traffic` parameter can only be set on Enterprise plans. Setting `"origin_traffic" = false` for a rule on a Free, Pro, or Business domain is automatically converted into `"origin_traffic" = true`.
