This guide describes the general steps to migrate your [Exposed Credentials Check](/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/) configuration to the new [leaked credentials detection](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/).

Cloudflare recommends that customers migrate to the new leaked credentials detection, which offers the following advantages:

- Uses a comprehensive database of leaked credentials, containing over 15 billion passwords.
- After enabling the detection, you can review the amount of incoming requests containing leaked credentials in Security Analytics, even before creating any mitigation rules.
- You can take action on the requests containing leaked credentials using WAF features like rate limiting rules or custom rules.

:::note
This migration guide applies to customers migrating from Exposed Credentials Check at the zone level.
:::

## 1. Turn off Exposed Credentials Check

If you had deployed the Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check managed ruleset:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules**.
3. Under **Managed rules**, edit the rule that executes the Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check Ruleset and take note of the current configuration (namely the performed action). Next, delete (or turn off) that rule.

:::note
While Exposed Credentials Check and leaked credentials detection can work side by side, enabling both features will increase the latency on incoming requests related to authentication.

## 2. Turn on leaked credentials detection

## 3. Configure the actions to take

Based on your previous configuration, do one of the following:

- If you were using the [default action](/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/#available-actions) in Exposed Credentials Check: Turn on the [**Add Leaked Credentials Checks Header** managed transform](/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/#add-leaked-credentials-checks-header) that adds the `Exposed-Credential-Check` header to incoming requests containing leaked credentials. Even though the header name is the same as in Exposed Credentials Check, the header values in the new implementation will vary between `1` and `4`.

- If you were using a different action: Create a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) with an action equivalent to the one you were using. The rule should match `User and password leaked is true` (if you are using the expression editor, enter `(cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked)`).

## More resources

- Check for the results of leaked credentials detection in [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/).
- Refer to [Mitigation examples](/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/examples/) for example mitigation strategies you can use when detecting leaked credentials.
