This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

To deploy custom rules at the account level, you must create a custom ruleset with one or more rules. Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to work with custom rulesets using the API.

## Procedure

To deploy a custom ruleset in your account, follow these general steps:

1. Create a custom ruleset in the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase with one or more rules.
2. Deploy the ruleset to the [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) of the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase at the account level.

Currently, you can only deploy WAF custom rulesets at the account level.

### 1. Create a custom ruleset

The following example creates a custom ruleset with a single rule in the `rules` array.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/api/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "description": "",
  "kind": "custom",
  "name": "My custom ruleset",
  "rules": [
    {
      "description": "Challenge web traffic (not /api)",
      "expression": "not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, \"/api/\")",
      "action": "managed_challenge"
    }
  ],
  "phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
}'
```

Save the ruleset ID in the response for the next step.

### 2. Deploy the custom ruleset

To deploy the custom ruleset, add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase entry point ruleset at the account level.

1.  <Render
    	file="rulesets/api-account/step1-get-entrypoint"
    	params={{ phaseName: "http_request_firewall_custom" }}
    />

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_custom/entrypoint" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
    ```

    ```json output {4}
    {
    	"result": {
    		"description": "Account-level phase entry point",
    		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
    		"kind": "root",
    		"last_updated": "2024-03-16T15:40:08.202335Z",
    		"name": "root",
    		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom",
    		"rules": [
    			// ...
    		],
    		"version": "9"
    	},
    	"success": true,
    	"errors": [],
    	"messages": []
    }
    ```

2.  <Render
    	file="rulesets/api-account/step2-create-rule"
    	params={{
    		deploymentItem: "custom ruleset",
    	}}
    />

    The following request creates a rule that executes the custom ruleset with ID `<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>` for all Enterprise zones in the account:

    ```bash
    curl "https://dash.cloudflare.com/api/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "description": "Execute custom ruleset",
      "expression": "(cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\")",
      "action": "execute",
      "action_parameters": {
        "id": "<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }'
    ```

    :::caution
    You can only apply custom rulesets to incoming traffic of zones on an Enterprise plan. To enforce this requirement, you must include `cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` in the expression of the `execute` rule deploying the custom ruleset.
    :::

3.  <Render
    	file="rulesets/api-account/step3-create-ruleset"
    	params={{
    		deploymentItem: "custom ruleset",
    		scope: "all incoming requests of Enterprise zones in your account",
    	}}
    />

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "description": "",
      "kind": "root",
      "name": "Account-level phase entry point",
      "rules": [
        {
          "action": "execute",
          "expression": "(cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\")",
          "action_parameters": {
            "id": "<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>"
          }
        }
      ],
      "phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
    }'
    ```

## Next steps

Use the different operations in the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to work with the custom ruleset you just created and deployed. The following table has a list of common tasks for working with custom rulesets at the account level:

| Task                               | Procedure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Get list of custom rulesets        | <p>Use the [List account rulesets][1] operation and search for rulesets with `"kind": "custom"` and `"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"`. The response will include the ruleset IDs.</p><p>For more information, refer to [List existing rulesets][2].</p> |
| List all rules in a custom ruleset | <p>Use the [Get an account ruleset][3] operation with the custom ruleset ID to obtain the list of configured rules and their IDs.</p><p>For more information, refer to [View a specific ruleset][4].</p>                                                        |
| Update a custom rule               | <p>Use the [Update an account ruleset rule][5] operation. You will need to provide the custom ruleset ID and the rule ID.</p><p>For more information, refer to [Update a rule in a ruleset][6].</p>                                                             |
| Delete a custom rule               | <p>Use the [Delete an account ruleset rule][7] operation. You will need to provide the custom ruleset ID and the rule ID.</p><p>For more information, refer to [Delete a rule in a ruleset][8].</p>                                                             |
