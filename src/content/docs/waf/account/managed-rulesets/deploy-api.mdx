This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to deploy a WAF managed ruleset to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase at the account level.

The [WAF Managed Rules](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) page includes the IDs of the different WAF managed rulesets. You will need this information when deploying rulesets via API.

## Example

<Render file="managed-rulesets/api-account-example" />

## Next steps

To customize the behavior of the rules included in a managed ruleset, [create an override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/).

To skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules, [create an exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/define-api/) (also called a skip rule).

Exceptions have priority over overrides.

## More resources

For more information on working with managed rulesets via API, refer to [Work with managed rulesets](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.
