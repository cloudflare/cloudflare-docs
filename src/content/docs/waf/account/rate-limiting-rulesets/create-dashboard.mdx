:::note
This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

At the account level, rate limiting rules are grouped into rate limiting rulesets. You must first create a custom ruleset with one or more rate limiting rules, and then deploy it to one or more zones on an Enterprise plan.

## 1. Create a custom rate limiting ruleset

To create a new custom rate limiting ruleset:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.

2. Go to Account Home > **WAF** > **Rate limiting rulesets**.

3. To create a new empty ruleset, select **Create ruleset**. To duplicate an existing ruleset, select the three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.

4. Enter a name for the ruleset and (optionally) a description.

5. In the ruleset creation page, select **Create rule**.

6. In the rule creation page, enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

7. Under **When incoming requests match**, use the **Field** drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for **Field** is compared to the value you specify for **Value** using the operator selected in **Operator**.

8. (Optional) Under **Cache status**, disable **Also apply rate limiting to cached assets** to consider only the requests that reach the origin when determining the rate.

9. Under **With the same characteristics**, configure the characteristics that will define the request counters for rate limiting purposes. Each value combination will have its own counter to determine the rate. Refer to [How Cloudflare determines the request rate](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/) for more information.

   The available characteristics depend on your Cloudflare plan and product subscriptions.

10. (Optional) To define an expression that specifies the conditions for incrementing the rate counter, enable **Use custom counting expression** and set the expression. By default, the counting expression is the same as the rule expression. The counting expression can include [response fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/http-request-response/).

11. Under **When rate exceeds**, define the maximum number of requests and the time period to consider when determining the rate.

12. Under **Then take action**, select the rule action from the **Choose an action** drop-down list. For example, selecting _Block_ tells Cloudflare to refuse requests in the conditions you specified when the request limit is reached.

13. (Optional) If you selected the _Block_ action, you can [configure a custom response](#configure-a-custom-response-for-blocked-requests) for requests exceeding the configured rate limit.

14. Select the mitigation timeout in the **Duration** dropdown. This is the time period during which Cloudflare applies the select action once the rate is reached.

    Enterprise customers with a paid add-on can [throttle requests](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-following-behavior) instead of applying the configured action for a selected duration. To throttle requests, under **With the following behavior** select _Throttle requests over the maximum configured rate_.

15. Select **Add rule**.

16. Create additional rate limiting rules as needed, and then select **Create** to create the ruleset.

## 2. Deploy the custom rate limiting ruleset

To deploy a custom rate limiting ruleset to one or more zones on an Enterprise plan:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.

2. Go to Account Home > **WAF** > **Rate limiting rulesets**.

3. Under **Your custom rate limiting rulesets** and next to the rate limiting ruleset you wish to deploy, select **Deploy**.

4. In the ruleset deployment page, enter a descriptive name for the rule deploying the ruleset in **Execution name**.

5. Under **Execution scope**, review the scope of the rate limiting ruleset to deploy. If necessary, select **Edit scope** and configure the expression that will determine the scope of the current rule.

   :::caution
   Deployed custom rate limiting rulesets will only apply to incoming traffic of zones on an Enterprise plan. The Expression Builder will automatically include this filter. If you define a custom expression using the Expression Editor, you must include `AND zone.level eq "ENT"` in your expression so that the rule only applies to zones on an Enterprise plan.
   :::

6. To deploy your rule immediately, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

The **Deployed custom rate limiting rulesets** list will show a rule for each deployed custom rate limiting ruleset.
