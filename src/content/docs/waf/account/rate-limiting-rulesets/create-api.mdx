To deploy rate limiting rules at the account level, you must create a rate limiting ruleset with one or more rules. Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to create and deploy rate limiting rulesets via API.

:::note
At the API level, a rate limiting ruleset is a regular [custom ruleset](/waf/account/custom-rulesets/) with one or more rate limiting rules that you create in the `http_ratelimit` phase. The concept of custom rate limiting ruleset exists in the Cloudflare dashboard to make it clear that you are configuring and deploying rate limiting rules at the account level. This page with API instructions uses the same terminology.
:::

Each rate limiting rule contains a `ratelimit` object with the rate limiting configuration. Refer to [Rate limiting parameters](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/) for more information on this object and its parameters.

## Procedure

To deploy a rate limiting ruleset in your account, follow these general steps:

1. Create a rate limiting ruleset (that is, a custom ruleset in the `http_ratelimit` phase ) with one or more rate limiting rules.
2. Deploy the ruleset to the [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) of the `http_ratelimit` phase at the account level.

### 1. Create a rate limiting ruleset

The following example creates a rate limiting ruleset with a single rate limiting rule in the `rules` array.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/api/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "description": "",
  "kind": "custom",
  "name": "My rate limiting ruleset",
  "rules": [
    {
      "description": "Rate limit API requests",
      "expression": "(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, \"/my-api/\"))",
      "ratelimit": {
        "characteristics": ["ip.src", "cf.colo.id"],
        "requests_to_origin": false,
        "requests_per_period": 30,
        "period": 60,
        "mitigation_timeout": 120
      },
      "action": "block",
      "action_parameters": {
        "response": {
          "status_code": 429,
          "content_type": "application/json",
          "content": "{ \"error\": \"Your API requests have been rate limited. Wait a couple of minutes and try again.\" }"
        }
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "phase": "http_ratelimit"
}'
```

The available characteristics depend on your Cloudflare plan and product subscriptions. Refer to [Availability](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/#availability) for more information.

Save the ruleset ID in the response for the next step.

### 2. Deploy the rate limiting ruleset

To deploy the rate limiting ruleset, add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to the `http_ratelimit` phase entry point ruleset at the account level.

1.  <Render
    	file="rulesets/api-account/step1-get-entrypoint"
    	params={{ phaseName: "http_ratelimit" }}
    />

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/phases/http_ratelimit/entrypoint" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
    ```

    ```json output {4}
    {
    	"result": {
    		"description": "Account-level phase entry point",
    		"id": "<RULESET_ID>",
    		"kind": "root",
    		"last_updated": "2024-03-16T15:40:08.202335Z",
    		"name": "root",
    		"phase": "http_ratelimit",
    		"rules": [
    			// ...
    		],
    		"source": "firewall_managed",
    		"version": "10"
    	},
    	"success": true,
    	"errors": [],
    	"messages": []
    }
    ```

2.  <Render
    	file="rulesets/api-account/step2-create-rule"
    	params={{
    		deploymentItem: "rate limiting ruleset",
    	}}
    />

    The following request creates a rule that executes the rate limiting ruleset with ID `<RATE_LIMITING_RULESET_ID>` for all Enterprise zones in the account:

    ```bash
    curl "https://dash.cloudflare.com/api/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}/rules" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "description": "Execute rate limiting ruleset",
      "expression": "(cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\")",
      "action": "execute",
      "action_parameters": {
        "id": "<RATE_LIMITING_RULESET_ID>"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }'
    ```

    <Render file="account-enterprise-zones-only-api" />

3.  <Render
    	file="rulesets/api-account/step3-create-ruleset"
    	params={{
    		deploymentItem: "rate limiting ruleset",
    		scope: "all incoming requests of Enterprise zones in your account",
    	}}
    />

    ```bash
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "description": "",
      "kind": "root",
      "name": "Account-level phase entry point",
      "rules": [
        {
          "action": "execute",
          "expression": "(cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\")",
          "action_parameters": {
            "id": "<RATE_LIMITING_RULESET_ID>"
          }
        }
      ],
      "phase": "http_ratelimit"
    }'
    ```

For examples of rate limiting rule definitions for the API, refer to the [zone-level API documentation](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/create-api/).

## Next steps

Use the different operations in the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to work with the ruleset you just created and deployed. The following table has a list of common tasks for working with rate limiting rulesets at the account level:

| Task                                      | Procedure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Update a rate limiting rule               | <p>Use the [Update an account ruleset rule][5] operation. You will need to provide the rate limiting ruleset ID and the rule ID.</p><p>For more information, refer to [Update a rule in a ruleset][6].</p>                                        |
| Delete a rate limiting rule               | <p>Use the [Delete an account ruleset rule][7] operation. You will need to provide the rate limiting ruleset ID and the rule ID.</p><p>For more information, refer to [Delete a rule in a ruleset][8].</p>                                        |
