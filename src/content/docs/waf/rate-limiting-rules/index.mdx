Rate limiting rules allow you to define rate limits for requests matching an expression, and the action to perform when those rate limits are reached.

## Rule parameters

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/), rate limiting rules have the following basic parameters:

<Render file="rate-limiting-rule-parameters" />

Refer to [Rate limiting parameters](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/) for more information on mandatory and optional parameters.

Refer to [How Cloudflare determines the request rate](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/) to learn how Cloudflare uses the parameters above when determining the rate of incoming requests.

## Important remarks

- Rate limiting rules are evaluated in order, and some actions like _Block_ will stop the evaluation of other rules. For more details on actions and their behavior, refer to the [actions reference](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/).

- Rate limiting rules are not designed to allow a precise number of requests to reach the origin server. In some situations, there may be a delay (up to a few seconds) between detecting a request and updating internal counters. Due to this delay, excess requests could still reach the origin server before Cloudflare enforces a mitigation action (such as blocking or challenging) in our global network.

- Applying rate limiting rules to verified bots might affect Search Engine Optimization (SEO). For more information, refer to [Improve SEO](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/improve-seo/).
