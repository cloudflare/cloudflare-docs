## Expression Builder

To use a list in the [Expression Builder](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/#expression-builder):

1. Select *is in list* or *is not in list* from the **Operator** drop-down list.

2. Select a list from the **Value** drop-down list. Depending on your plan, you may be able to select a [Managed IP List](/waf/tools/lists/managed-lists/#managed-ip-lists).

3. To commit your changes and enable the rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to enable the rule, select **Save as Draft**.

## Expression Editor

To use a list in the [Expression Editor](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/#expression-editor), specify the `in` operator and use `$<list_name>` to specify the name of the list.

Examples:

* Expression matching requests from IP addresses that are in an IP list named `office_network`:

  ```txt
  ip.src in $office_network
  ```

* Expression matching requests with a source IP address different from IP addresses in the `office_network` IP list:

  ```txt
  not ip.src in $office_network
  ```

* Expression matching requests from IP addresses in the Cloudflare Open Proxies [Managed IP List](/waf/tools/lists/managed-lists/#managed-ip-lists):

  ```txt
  ip.src in $cf.open_proxies
  ```
