This feature, when turned on, automatically rewrites URLs to external JavaScript libraries to point to Cloudflare-hosted libraries instead. This change improves security and performance, and reduces the risk of malicious code being injected.

This rewrite operation currently supports the `polyfill` JavaScript library hosted in `polyfill.io`.

:::caution[Warning]

You may need to update your <GlossaryTooltip term="content security policy (CSP)">Content Security Policy (CSP)</GlossaryTooltip> when turning on **Replace insecure JavaScript libraries**. The feature, when enabled, will not perform any URL rewrites if a CSP is present with a `script-src` or `default-src` directive. Cloudflare will not check `report-only` directives and it will not modify CSP headers.

Additionally, if you are defining a CSP via HTML `meta` tag, you must either turn off this feature or switch to a CSP defined in an HTTP header.
:::

## How it works

When turned on, Cloudflare will check HTTP(S) proxied traffic for `script` tags with an `src` attribute pointing to a potentially insecure service and replace the `src` value with the equivalent link hosted under [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/).

The rewritten URL will keep the original URL scheme (`http://` or `https://`).

For `polyfill.io` URL rewrites, all `3.*` versions of the `polyfill` library are supported under the `/v3` path. Additionally, the `/v2` path is also supported. If an unknown version is requested under the `/v3` path, Cloudflare will rewrite the URL to use the latest `3.*` version of the library (currently `3.111.0`).

## Availability

The feature is available in all Cloudflare plans, and is turned on by default on Free plans.

## Final remarks

Since [`pages.dev` zones](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) are on a Free plan, the **Replace insecure JavaScript libraries** feature is turned on by default on these zones and it is not possible to turn it off.
