:::note

WAF content scanning is available to customers on an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.
:::

## 1. Enable WAF content scanning

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Settings**.
3. Under **Incoming traffic detections**, turn on **Malicious uploads**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Enable the feature using a `POST` request similar to the following:

```bash
curl --request POST \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/content-upload-scan/enable" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 2. Validate the content scanning behavior

Use [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) and HTTP logs to validate that malicious content objects are being detected correctly.

You can use the [EICAR anti-malware test file](https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/) to test content scanning (select the ZIP format).

Alternatively, create a WAF custom rule like described in the next step using a _Log_ action instead of a mitigation action like _Block_. This rule will generate security events (available in **Security** > **Events**) that will allow you to validate your configuration.

## 3. Create a WAF custom rule

Create a WAF [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) that blocks detected malicious content objects uploaded to your application.

For example, create a custom rule with the _Block_ action and the following expression:

| Field                        | Operator | Value |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Has malicious content object | equals   | True  |

If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

```txt
(cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj)
```

This rule will match requests where the WAF detects a suspicious or malicious content object. For a list of fields provided by WAF content scanning, refer to [Content scanning fields](/waf/about/content-scanning/#content-scanning-fields).

<Details header="Optional: Combine with other Rules language fields">

You can combine the previous expression with other [fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/) and [functions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/) of the Rules language. This allows you to customize the rule scope or combine content scanning with other security features. For example:

- The following expression will match requests with malicious content objects uploaded to a specific endpoint:

  | Field                        | Operator | Value        | Logic |
  | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----- |
  | Has malicious content object | equals   | True         | And   |
  | URI Path                     | contains | `upload.php` |       |

  Expression when using the editor:

  ```txt
  (cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj and http.request.uri.path contains "upload.php")
  ```

- The following expression will match requests from bots uploading content objects:

  | Field              | Operator  | Value | Logic |
  | ------------------ | --------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Has content object | equals    | True  | And   |
  | Bot Score          | less than | `10`  |       |

  Expression when using the editor:

  ```txt
  (cf.waf.content_scan.has_obj and cf.bot_management.score lt 10)
  ```

</Details>

For additional examples, refer to [Example rules](/waf/about/content-scanning/example-rules/).

## 4. (Optional) Configure a custom scan expression

To check uploaded content in a way that is not covered by the default configuration, add a [custom scan expression](/waf/about/content-scanning/#custom-scan-expressions).

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **Settings**.

3. Under **Incoming traffic detections**, select **Malicious uploads**.

4. Select **Add content object location**.

5. In **Content location**, enter your custom scan expression. For example:

   ```txt
   lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "file")
   ```

6. Select **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Use a `POST` request similar to the following:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/content-upload-scan/payloads" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
  {
    "payload": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"file\")"
  }
]'
```

The above request will add the following expression to the current list of custom scan expressions:

```txt
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "file")
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

The custom scan expression will scan any string found in an HTTP body with the following JSON string:

```json
{ "file": "<BASE64_ENCODED_STRING>" }
```

:::note[Note]

The content scanner will automatically decode Base64 strings.
