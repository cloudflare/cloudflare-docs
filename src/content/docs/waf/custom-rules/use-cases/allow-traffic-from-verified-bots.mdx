    content: Allow traffic from search engine bots and other verified bots
---

This example challenges requests from a list of countries, but allows traffic from search engine bots — such as Googlebot and Bingbot — and from other [verified bots](/bots/concepts/bot/#verified-bots).

The rule expression uses the [`cf.client.bot`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/dynamic-fields/#cfclientbot) field to determine if the request originated from a known good bot or crawler.

- **Expression**: `(ip.geoip.country in {"US" "MX"} and not cf.client.bot)`
- **Action**: _Managed Challenge_
