This example skips WAF rules for requests from IP addresses in an allowlist (defined using an [IP list](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#ip-lists)).

1. [Create an IP list](/waf/tools/lists/create-dashboard/) with the IP addresses for which you want to allow access.<br/>
   For example, create an IP list named `allowed_ips` with one or more IP addresses. For more information on the accepted IP address formats, refer to [IP lists](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#ip-lists).

2. Create a custom rule skipping all rules for any request from the IPs in the list you created (`allowed_ips` in the current example).

  - **Expression**: `(ip.src in $allowed_ips)`
  - **Action**: <em>Skip:</em>
    - <em>All remaining custom rules</em>
    - <em>Skip phases:</em>
        - <em>All rate limiting rules</em>
        - <em>All Super Bot Fight Mode rules</em>
        - <em>All managed rules</em>

Make sure the new rule appears before any other custom rules in the rules list.
