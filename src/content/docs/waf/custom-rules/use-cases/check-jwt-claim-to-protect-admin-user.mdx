    content: Issue challenge for admin user in JWT claim based on attack score
---

This example configures additional protection for requests with a JSON Web Token (JWT) with a user claim of `admin`, based on the request's attack score.

Create a custom rule that issues a Managed Challenge if the user claim in a JWT is `admin` and the attack score is below 40.

    - **Expression**: `(lookup_json_string(http.request.jwt.claims["598923e4-6b55-423d-8519-745003f27cca"][0], "user") eq "admin" and cf.waf.score < 40)`
    - **Action**: _Managed Challenge_

:::note
To use claims inside a JSON Web Token (JWT), you must first set up a [token validation configuration](/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/configure/) in API Shield.
