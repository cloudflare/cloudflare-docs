title: Require specific HTTP ports

import { Render } from "~/components";

By default, Cloudflare allows requests on a [number of different HTTP ports](/fundamentals/reference/network-ports/).

You can target requests based on their HTTP port with the [`cf.edge.server_port`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/dynamic-fields/#cfedgeserver_port) field. Use the `in` [comparison operator](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#comparison-operators) to target a set of ports.

This example blocks requests to `www.example.com` that are not on ports `80` or `443`:

- **Expression**: `(http.host eq "www.example.com" and not cf.edge.server_port in {80 443})`
- **Action**: _Block_

Custom rules and WAF Managed Rules can block traffic at the application layer (layer 7 in the [OSI model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)), preventing HTTP/HTTPS requests over non-standard ports from reaching the origin server.
