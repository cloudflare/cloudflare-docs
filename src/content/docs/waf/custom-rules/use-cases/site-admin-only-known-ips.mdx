title: Require known IP addresses in site admin area
---

If an attack compromises the administrative area of your website, the consequences can be severe. With custom rules, you can protect your siteâ€™s admin area by blocking requests for access to admin paths that do not come from a known IP address.

The example below limits access to the WordPress admin area, `/wp-admin/`, by blocking requests that do not originate from a specified set of IP addresses.

To prevent attackers from successfully using a permutation of `/wp-admin/` such as `/wP-AdMiN/`, use the [`lower()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#lower) transformation function to convert the URI path to lowercase:

- **Expression**: `(not ip.src in {10.20.30.40 192.168.1.0/24} and starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/wp-admin"))`
- **Action**: _Block_
