title: Require a specific cookie

---

To secure a sensitive area such as a development area, you can share a cookie with trusted individuals and then filter requests so that only users with that cookie can access your site.

Use the [`http.cookie`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/standard-fields/#httpcookie) field to target requests based on the presence of a specific cookie.

This example comprises two rules:

* The first rule targets requests to `dev.www.example.com` that have a specific cookie key, `devaccess`. As long as the value of the cookie key contains one of three authorized users — `james`, `matt`, or `michael` — the expression matches and the request is allowed, skipping all other custom rules.
* The second rule blocks all access to `dev.www.example.com`.

Since custom rules are evaluated in order, Cloudflare grants access to requests that satisfy rule 1 and blocks all other requests to `dev.www.example.com`:

1. Rule 1:
  - **Expression**: `(http.cookie contains "devaccess=james" or http.cookie contains "devaccess=matt" or http.cookie contains "devaccess=michael") and http.host eq "dev.www.example.com"`
  - **Action**: Skip:
    - All remaining custom rules
2. Rule 2:
  - **Expression**: `(http.host eq "dev.www.example.com")`
  - **Action**: *Block*
