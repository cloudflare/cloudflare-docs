<GlossaryDefinition term="threat score" />

This example blocks requests based on country code ([ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) format), from IP addresses that score greater than 0. This is equivalent to setting the Security Level in **Security** > **Settings** to *High*. For more information, refer to [Security Level](/waf/tools/security-level/).

- **Expression**: `(ip.geoip.country in {"CN" "TW" "US" "GB"} and cf.threat_score gt 0)`
- **Action**: *Block*
