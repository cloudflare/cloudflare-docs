title: Stop R-U-Dead-Yet? (R.U.D.Y.) attacks
---

R-U-Dead-Yet (R.U.D.Y.) attacks accomplish denial of service (DoS) by submitting long form fields. Use custom rules to stop these attacks by blocking requests that do not have a legitimate session cookie.

This example combines three expressions to target HTTP `POST` requests that do not contain a legitimate authenticated session cookie:

- The first expression uses the [`http.request.uri.path`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/standard-fields/#httprequesturipath) field to target the paths to secure from R.U.D.Y.:

  ```txt
  http.request.uri.path matches "(comment|conversation|event|poll)/create"
  ```

- The second uses a regular expression to match the format of a legitimate `auth_session` cookie. The `not` operator targets requests where that cookie is not formatted correctly:

  ```txt
  not http.cookie matches "auth_session=[0-9a-zA-Z]{32}-[0-9]{10}-[0-9a-z]{6}"
  ```

- The third expression targets HTTP `POST` requests:

  ```txt
  http.request.method eq "POST"
  ```

The three expressions are combined into a compound expression using the `and` operator. When an HTTP `POST` request to any of the specified URIs does not contain a properly formatted `auth_session` cookie, Cloudflare blocks the request:

- **Expression**: `(http.request.method eq "POST" and http.request.uri.path matches "(comment|conversation|event|poll)/create" and not http.cookie matches "auth_session=[0-9a-zA-Z]{32}-[0-9]{10}-[0-9a-z]{6}")`
- **Action**: _Block_

:::note
The [`matches`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#comparison-operators) operator requires a Cloudflare Business or Enterprise plan.
