import { Example } from "~/components";

## Rewrite path for requests with leaked passwords

Create a [URL rewrite](/rules/transform/url-rewrite/) to send your end users to the reset password page at your origin server if their login attempt contains a previously leaked password.

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**:

- **Custom filter expression**:<br/>
  `(http.request.uri.path eq "/login" and cf.waf.credential_check.password_leaked)`

**Then**:

- **Path** > **Rewrite to**: _Static_ | **Value**: `/resetpassword`
- **Query** > **Preserve**

</Example>

## Rate limit suspicious logins with leaked credentials

:::note
Access to the `cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked` field requires a Pro plan or above.
:::

Create a [rate limiting rule](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) using [account takeover (ATO) detection](/bots/concepts/detection-ids/#account-takeover-detections) and leaked credentials fields to limit volumetric attacks from particular IP addresses, JA4 Fingerprints, or countries.

The following example rule applies rate limiting to requests with a specific [ATO detection ID](/bots/concepts/detection-ids/#account-takeover-detections) (corresponding to `Observes all login traffic to the zone`) that contain a previously leaked username and password:

<Example>

**When incoming requests match**:<br/>
`(any(cf.bot_management.detection_ids[*] eq 201326593 and cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked))`

**With the same characteristics**: _IP_

When rate exceeds:

- **Requests**: `5`
- **Period**: _1 minute_

</Example>

## Log requests containing leaked credentials

:::note[Notes]

- Access to the `cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked` field requires a Pro plan or above.
- The _Log_ action requires an Enterprise plan.

:::

Create a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) that logs requests containing a previously leaked set of credentials (username and password).

- **Expression**: If you use the Expression Builder, configure the following expression:

  | Field                    | Operator | Value |
  | ------------------------ | -------- | ----- |
  | User and Password Leaked | equals   | True  |

  If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

  ```txt
  (cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked)
  ```

- **Action**: _Log_
