import { Render } from "~/components";

Configure exposed credentials checks using the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/). You can do the following:

- [Deploy the Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/exposed-credentials-check/#configure-via-api).
- Create custom rules that check for exposed credentials.

## Create a custom rule checking for exposed credentials

:::note
This feature requires account-level WAF, which is available to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on.
:::

You can create rules that check for exposed credentials using the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/). Include these rules in a custom ruleset, which you must create at the account level, and then deploy the custom ruleset to a phase.

A rule checking for exposed credentials has a match when both the rule expression and the result from the exposed credentials check are true.

To check for exposed credentials in a custom rule, include the `exposed_credential_check` object in the rule definition. This object must have the following properties:

- `username_expression` — Expression that selects the user ID used in the credentials check. This property can have up to 1024 characters.
- `password_expression` — Expression that selects the password used in the credentials check. This property can have up to 1024 characters.

:::note

These properties have additional requirements:

- Each expression must evaluate to a string.
- You can only use the [`upper()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#upper), [`lower()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#lower), [`url_decode()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#url_decode), and [`lookup_json_string()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#lookup_json_string) functions, and you cannot nest these functions.

:::

You can use the `exposed_credential_check` object in rules with one of the following actions: `rewrite`, `log`, `block`, `challenge`, or `js_challenge`. Cloudflare recommends that you only use exposed credentials checks with the following actions: `rewrite` and `log`.

To create and deploy a custom ruleset, follow the workflow described in [Work with custom rulesets](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/).

### Example A

This `POST` request example creates a new custom ruleset with a rule that checks for exposed credentials. The rule has a match if both the rule expression and the `exposed_credential_check` result are `true`. When there is a match, the rule will log the request with exposed credentials in the Cloudflare logs.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "Custom Ruleset A",
  "kind": "custom",
  "description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "log",
      "description": "Exposed credentials check on login.php page",
      "expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\"",
      "exposed_credential_check": {
        "username_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"username\"][0])",
        "password_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"password\"][0])"
      }
    }
  ],
  "phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
}'
```

The response returns the created ruleset. Note the presence of the `exposed_credential_check` object on the rule definition.

```json null {15-18}
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Custom Ruleset A",
		"description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<CUSTOM_RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "log",
				"description": "Exposed credentials check on login.php page",
				"expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\"",
				"exposed_credential_check": {
					"username_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"username\"][0])",
					"password_expression": "url_decode(http.request.body.form[\"password\"][0])"
				},
				"last_updated": "2021-03-19T10:48:04.057775Z",
				"ref": "<CUSTOM_RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2021-03-19T10:48:04.057775Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

The example uses the `url_decode()` function because fields in the request body (available in `http.request.body.form`) are URL-encoded when the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

After creating a custom ruleset, deploy it to a phase so that it executes. Refer to [Deploy a custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/) for more information.

### Example B

This `POST` request example creates a new custom ruleset with a rule that checks for exposed credentials in JSON responses. The rule has a match if both the rule expression and the `exposed_credential_check` result are `true`. When there is a match, the rule will add an `Exposed-Credential-Check` HTTP header to the request with value `1`.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "Custom Ruleset B",
  "kind": "custom",
  "description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "rewrite",
      "action_parameters": {
        "headers": {
          "Exposed-Credential-Check": {
            "operation": "set",
            "value": "1"
          }
        }
      },
      "description": "Exposed credentials check on login endpoint with JSON body",
      "expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\" && any(http.request.headers[\"content-type\"][*] == \"application/json\")",
      "exposed_credential_check": {
        "username_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"username\")",
        "password_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"password\")"
      }
    }
  ],
  "phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
}'
```

The response returns the created ruleset. Note the presence of the following elements in the rule definition:

- The `rewrite` action.
- The `action_parameters` object configuring the HTTP header added to requests with exposed credentials.
- The `exposed_credential_check` object.

```json null {12-20,23-26}
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<CUSTOM_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Custom Ruleset B",
		"description": "This ruleset includes a rule checking for exposed credentials.",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"rules": [
			{
				"id": "<CUSTOM_RULE_ID>",
				"version": "1",
				"action": "rewrite",
				"action_parameters": {
					"headers": {
						"Exposed-Credential-Check": {
							"operation": "set",
							"value": "1"
						}
					}
				},
				"description": "Exposed credentials check on login endpoint with JSON body",
				"expression": "http.request.method == \"POST\" && http.request.uri == \"/login.php\" && any(http.request.headers[\"content-type\"][*] == \"application/json\")",
				"exposed_credential_check": {
					"username_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"username\")",
					"password_expression": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"password\")"
				},
				"last_updated": "2022-03-19T12:48:04.057775Z",
				"ref": "<CUSTOM_RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2022-03-19T12:48:04.057775Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

## Next steps

After creating a custom ruleset, deploy it to the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase at the account level so that it executes. You will need the ruleset ID to deploy the custom ruleset. For more information, refer to [Deploy a custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/).
