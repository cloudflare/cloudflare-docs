Generate a public/private key pair using the Cloudflare [`matched-data-cli`](https://github.com/cloudflare/matched-data-cli) command-line tool. After generating a key pair, enter the generated public key in the payload logging configuration.

Do the following:

1. [Download](https://github.com/cloudflare/matched-data-cli/releases) the `matched-data-cli` tool for your platform from the **Releases** page on GitHub, under **Assets**.

2. Extract the content of the downloaded `.tar.gz` file to a local folder.

3. Open a terminal and go to the local folder containing the `matched-data-cli` tool.

   ```sh
   cd matched-data-cli
   ```

4. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   ./matched-data-cli generate-key-pair
   ```

   ```sh output
   {
    "private_key": "uBS5eBttHrqkdY41kbZPdvYnNz8Vj0TvKIUpjB1y/GA=",
    "public_key": "Ycig/Zr/pZmklmFUN99nr+taURlYItL91g+NcHGYpB8="
   }
   ```

After generating the key pair, copy the public key value and enter it in the payload logging configuration.
