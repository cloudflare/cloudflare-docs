    content: Configure payload logging for a managed ruleset via API
---

import { RuleID } from "~/components";

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to configure payload logging for a managed ruleset via API.

## Configure and enable payload logging

1. Use the [Get a zone entry point ruleset](/api/operations/getZoneEntrypointRuleset) operation to obtain the following IDs:

   - The ID of the [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) of the `http_request_firewall_managed` [phase](/ruleset-engine/about/phases/).
   - The ID of the rule deploying the WAF managed ruleset (an `execute` rule) for which you want to configure payload logging.

2. Use the [Update a zone ruleset rule](/api/operations/updateZoneRulesetRule) operation to update the rule you identified in the previous step.

   Include a `matched_data` object in the rule's `action_parameters` object to configure payload logging. The `matched_data` object has the following structure:

   ```json null {3-5}
   "action_parameters": {
     // ...
     "matched_data": {
       "public_key": "<PUBLIC_KEY_VALUE>"
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `<PUBLIC_KEY_VALUE>` with the public key you want to use for payload logging. You can generate a public key [in the command line](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair/) or [in the Cloudflare dashboard](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure/).

:::note[Account-level configuration]

To configure payload logging for a managed ruleset deployed at the account level (only available in Enterprise plans with a paid add-on), use the following API operations instead:

- In step 1: [Get an account entry point ruleset](/api/operations/getAccountEntrypointRuleset)
- In step 2: [Update an account ruleset rule](/api/operations/updateAccountRulesetRule)

:::

### Example

This example configures payload logging for the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/), which is already deployed for a zone with ID `{zone_id}`.

1. Invoke the [Get a zone entry point ruleset](/api/operations/getZoneEntrypointRuleset) operation (a `GET` request) to obtain the rules currently configured in the entry point ruleset of the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

   ```bash title="Request"
   curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
   ```

   ```json title="Example response" {3,12,20}
   {
   	"result": {
   		"id": "060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c", // entry point ruleset ID
   		"name": "default",
   		"description": "",
   		"source": "firewall_managed",
   		"kind": "zone",
   		"version": "3",
   		"rules": [
   			// (...)
   			{
   				"id": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7", // `execute` rule ID
   				"version": "1",
   				"action": "execute",
   				"expression": "true",
   				"last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:21:28.643979Z",
   				"ref": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7",
   				"enabled": true,
   				"action_parameters": {
   					"id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee", // "Cloudflare Managed Ruleset" ID
   					"version": "latest"
   				}
   			}
   			// (...)
   		],
   		"last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:29:00.190643Z",
   		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
   	},
   	"success": true,
   	"errors": [],
   	"messages": []
   }
   ```

2. Save the following IDs for the next step:

   - The ID of the entry point ruleset: `060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c`
   - The ID of the `execute` rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset: `1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7`

   To find the correct rule in the `rules` array, search for an `execute` rule containing the ID of the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (<RuleID id="efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee" />) in `action_parameters` > `id`.

   :::note

   To get the IDs of existing WAF managed rulesets, refer to [WAF Managed Rules](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) or use the [List account rulesets](/api/operations/listAccountRulesets) operation.
   :::

3. Invoke the [Update a zone ruleset rule](/api/operations/updateZoneRulesetRule) operation (a `PATCH` request) to update the configuration of the rule you identified. The rule will now include the payload logging configuration (`matched_data` object).

   ```bash title="Request" {9-11}
   curl --request PATCH \
   "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c/rules/1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data '{
     "action": "execute",
     "action_parameters": {
       "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",
       "matched_data": {
         "public_key": "Ycig/Zr/pZmklmFUN99nr+taURlYItL91g+NcHGYpB8="
       }
     },
     "expression": "true"
   }'
   ```

   The response will include the complete ruleset after updating the rule.

For more information on deploying managed rulesets via API, refer to [Deploy a managed ruleset](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/deploy-managed-ruleset/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

## Disable payload logging

To disable payload logging for a managed ruleset:

1. Use the [Update a zone ruleset rule](/api/operations/updateZoneRulesetRule) operation (a `PATCH` request) to update the rule deploying the managed ruleset (an `execute` rule).

2. Modify the rule definition so that there is no `matched_data` object in `action_parameters`.

For example, the following `PATCH` request updates rule with ID `{rule_id}` deploying the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) so that payload logging is disabled:

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{entrypoint_ruleset_id}/rules/{rule_id}" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "action": "execute",
  "action_parameters": {
    "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee"
  },
  "expression": "true"
}'
```

For details on obtaining the entry point ruleset ID and the ID of the rule to update, refer to [Configure and enable payload logging](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure-api/#configure-and-enable-payload-logging).
