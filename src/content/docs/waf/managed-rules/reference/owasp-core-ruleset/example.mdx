The following example calculates the OWASP request threat score for an incoming request. The OWASP managed ruleset configuration is the following:

- OWASP Anomaly Score Threshold: _High - 25 and higher_
- OWASP Paranoia Level: _PL3_
- OWASP Action: _Managed Challenge_

This table shows the progress of the OWASP ruleset evaluation:

| Rule ID       | Paranoia level | Rule matched?   | Rule score | Cumulative<br/>threat score |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------: | --------------------------: |
| –             | –              | –               |          – |                           0 |
| `...1813a269` | PL3            | Yes             |         +5 |                           5 |
| `...ccc02be6` | PL3            | No              |          – |                           5 |

| `...48b74690` | PL1            | Yes             |         +5 |                          15 |

| `...e5f94216` | PL3            | Yes             |         +3 |                          26 |
| (...)         | (...)          | (...)           |      (...) |                       (...) |
| `...f3b37cb1` | PL4            | (not evaluated) |          – |                          26 |

Final request threat score: `26`

Since `26` >= `25` — that is, the threat score is greater than the configured score threshold — the WAF will apply the configured action (_Managed Challenge_). If you had configured a score threshold of _Medium - 40 and higher_, the WAF would not apply the action, since the request threat score would be lower than the score threshold (`26` < `40`).

The [**Activity log** in Security Events](/waf/analytics/security-events/paid-plans/#activity-log) would display the following details for the example incoming request handled by the OWASP Core Ruleset:

In the activity log, the rule associated with requests mitigated by the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset is the last rule in this managed ruleset: `949110: Inbound Anomaly Score Exceeded`, with rule ID <RuleID id="6179ae15870a4bb7b2d480d4843b323c" />.
