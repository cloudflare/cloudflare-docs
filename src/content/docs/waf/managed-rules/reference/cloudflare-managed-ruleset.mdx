Created by the Cloudflare security team, this ruleset provides fast and effective protection for all of your applications. The ruleset is updated frequently to cover new vulnerabilities and reduce false positives.

Cloudflare recommends that you enable the rules whose tags correspond to your technology stack. For example, if you use WordPress, enable the rules tagged with `wordpress`.

Cloudflareâ€™s [WAF changelog](/waf/change-log/) allows you to monitor ongoing changes to the WAF's managed rulesets.

:::note

Some rules in the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset are disabled by default, intending to strike a balance between providing the right protection and reducing the number of false positives.

It is not recommended that you enable all the available rules using overrides, since it may affect legitimate traffic, unless you are running a proof of concept (PoC) to understand what kind of requests the WAF can block.

## Configure in the dashboard

You can configure the following settings of the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- **Set the action to perform.** When you define an action for the ruleset, you override the default action defined for each rule. The available actions are: _Managed Challenge_, _Block_, _JS Challenge_, _Log_, and _Interactive Challenge_. To remove the action override, set the ruleset action to _Default_.
- **Override the action performed by individual rules or rules with specific tags.** The available actions are: _Managed Challenge_, _Block_, _JS Challenge_, _Log_, and _Interactive Challenge_.
- **Disable specific rules or rules with specific tags.**
- **Customize the filter expression.** With a custom expression, the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset applies only to a subset of the incoming requests.
- **Configure [payload logging](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure/)**.

For details on configuring a managed ruleset in the dashboard, refer to [Configure a managed ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/deploy-zone-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset).

## Configure via API

To enable the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset for a given zone via API, create a rule with `execute` action in the entry point ruleset for the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.
