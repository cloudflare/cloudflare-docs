---

Create an exception to skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules. The exception configuration includes an expression that defines the skip conditions, and the rules or rulesets to skip under those conditions.

## Types of exceptions

An exception can have one of the following behaviors (from highest to lowest priority):

* Skip all remaining rules (belonging to WAF managed rulesets)
* Skip one or more WAF managed rulesets
* Skip one or more rules of WAF managed rulesets

For more information on exceptions, refer to [Create an exception](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

## Next steps

Add exceptions [in the Cloudflare dashboard](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/define-dashboard/) or [via API](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/define-api/).
