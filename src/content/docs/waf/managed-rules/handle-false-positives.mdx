If you encounter a false positive caused by a managed rule, do one of the following:

- **Add an exception**: [Exceptions](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/) allow you to skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules for certain requests.

- **Adjust the OWASP managed ruleset**: A request blocked by the rule with ID <RuleID id="6179ae15870a4bb7b2d480d4843b323c" /> and description `949110: Inbound Anomaly Score Exceeded` refers to the [Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/). To resolve the issue, [configure the OWASP managed ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/configure-dashboard/).

- **Disable the corresponding managed rule(s)**: Create an override to disable specific rules. This may avoid false positives, but you will also reduce the overall site security. Refer to the [dashboard instructions](/waf/managed-rules/deploy-zone-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset) on configuring a managed ruleset, or to the [API instructions](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) on creating an override.

:::note

If you contact Cloudflare Support to verify whether a WAF managed rule triggers as expected, [provide a HAR file](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#generate-a-har-file) captured while sending the specific request of concern.

## Additional recommendations

- If one specific rule causes false positives, disable that specific rule and not the entire ruleset.

- For false positives with the administrator area of your website, add an [exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/) disabling a managed rule for the admin section of your site resources. You can use an expression similar to the following:

  `http.host eq "example.com" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/admin")`
