## Managed rulesets

Cloudflare provides the following managed rulesets in the WAF:

- [**Cloudflare Managed Ruleset**](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/): Created by the Cloudflare security team, this ruleset provides fast and effective protection for all of your applications. The ruleset is updated frequently to cover new vulnerabilities and reduce false positives.<br/>Ruleset ID: <RuleID id="efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee" />

- [**Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset**](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/): Cloudflare's implementation of the Open Web Application Security Project, or OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set. Cloudflare routinely monitors for updates from OWASP based on the latest version available from the official code repository.<br/>Ruleset ID: <RuleID id="4814384a9e5d4991b9815dcfc25d2f1f" />

- [**Cloudflare Exposed Credentials Check**](/waf/managed-rules/reference/exposed-credentials-check/): Deploy an automated credentials check on your end-user authentication endpoints. For any credential pair, the Cloudflare WAF performs a lookup against a public database of stolen credentials.<br/>Ruleset ID: <RuleID id="c2e184081120413c86c3ab7e14069605" />

- **Cloudflare Free Managed Ruleset**: Available on all Cloudflare plans. Designed to provide mitigation against high and wide impacting vulnerabilities. The rules are safe to deploy on most applications. If you deployed the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset for your site, you do not need to deploy this managed ruleset.<br/>Ruleset ID: <RuleID id="77454fe2d30c4220b5701f6fdfb893ba" />

The following managed rulesets run in a response phase:

- [**Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection**](/waf/managed-rules/reference/sensitive-data-detection/): Created by Cloudflare to address common data loss threats. These rules monitor the download of specific sensitive data â€” for example, financial and personally identifiable information. Available in **Security** > **Sensitive Data**.<br/>Ruleset ID: <RuleID id="e22d83c647c64a3eae91b71b499d988e" />

## Availability

The managed rulesets you can deploy depend on your Cloudflare plan.

<Render

	params={{
		overridesUrl:
			"/waf/managed-rules/deploy-zone-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset",
	}}
/>

## Zone-level deployment

At the zone level, you can only deploy each WAF managed ruleset once. At the [account level](/waf/account/managed-rulesets/) you can deploy each managed ruleset multiple times.

## Important remarks

Cloudflare analyzes the body of incoming requests up to a certain maximum size that varies according to your Cloudflare plan. For Enterprise customers, the maximum body size is 128 KB, while for other plans the limit is lower. This means that the behavior of specific managed rules that analyze request bodies can vary according to your current Cloudflare plan.
