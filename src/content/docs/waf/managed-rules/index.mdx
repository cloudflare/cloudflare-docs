<FeatureTable id="security.waf_a_managed_rules" />

## Customize the behavior of managed rulesets

To customize the behavior of managed rulesets, do one of the following:

* [Create exceptions](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/) to skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules under certain conditions.
* [Configure overrides](/waf/managed-rules/deploy-zone-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset) to override the default rule action or disable one or more rules of managed rulesets. Overrides can affect an entire managed ruleset, specific tags, or specific rules in the managed ruleset.

Exceptions have priority over overrides.
