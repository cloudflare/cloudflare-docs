<Description>

Build real-time serverless video, audio and data applications.

</Description>

Cloudflare Calls is infrastructure for real-time audio/video/data applications. It allows you to build real-time apps without worrying about scaling or regions. It can act as a selective forwarding unit (WebRTC SFU), as a fanout delivery system for broadcasting (WebRTC CDN) or anything in between.

Cloudflare Calls runs on [Cloudflare's global cloud network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) in hundreds of cities worldwide.
