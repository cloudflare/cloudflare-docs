## Get started

Google tag in first-party mode allows website owners using Cloudflare as a CDN to get the most out of ad measurement tools with just a few clicks.

At the moment, Google tag in first-party mode is in closed beta. You can [sign up](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/lp/google-tag-first-party-mode/) to participate in the closed beta through [Google Ads](http://ads.google.com), [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) or [Google Marketing Platform](https://marketingplatform.google.com/).

### Configure Google tag in first-party mode in the dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Go to **Google tag in first-party mode** > **Configuration**.
3. Enable the toggle for **Turn on and configure Google tag**.

4. Add your Google tag ID and the path on your website reserved for the Google tag. 
The [Google tag ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9539598?hl=en) can be found in the Google Tag Experience dashboard. The measurement path is an unused path on your site that will load Google Tag Manager and all subsequent measurement requests.

5. Once you click **Save**, Google Tag in First Party Mode will be enabled on your zone. If you already have a GTM script on your website, this First Party Tag will override the existing script.

Now that you have authenticated into your Cloudflare account and configured GTM in first-party mode, your Google Tags will be loaded using `https://your-domain/measurement-path/...`and subsequent measurement requests will be served by Cloudflare.
