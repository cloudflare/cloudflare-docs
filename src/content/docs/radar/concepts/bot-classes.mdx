A bot class in Radar is a grouping of [bot scores](/bots/concepts/bot-score).

Scores between 1 to 29 are classified as bot traffic. Scores equal or above 30 are classified as non-bot/human traffic.

| Class                | Description                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Likely automated** | Bot scores of 1 through 29.  |
| **Likely human**     | Bot scores of 30 through 99. |
