Spectrum logs the entire lifecycle of every client that connects through it. These event logs are available through Logpush as a separate category (dataset type `spectrum_events`); they are not part of HTTP log events.

For each connection, Spectrum logs a connect event and either a disconnect or error event. Details on status codes can be found below.

## Configure Logpush

Spectrum [log events](/logs/reference/log-fields/) can be configured through the dashboard or API, depending on your preferred [destination](/logs/get-started/enable-destinations/).
