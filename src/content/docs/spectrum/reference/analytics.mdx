| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| count          | Count of total events               | `1000`  | Count                |
| bytesIngress   | Sum of ingress bytes                | `1000`  | Sum                  |
| bytesEgress    | Sum of egress bytes                 | `1000`  | Sum                  |
| durationAvg    | Average connection duration         | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |
| durationMedian | Median connection duration          | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |
| duration90th   | 90th percentile connection duration | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |
| duration99th   | 99th percentile connection duration | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |



## Additional dimensions

You can divide your analytics further by the following dimensions.



| Dimension | Name                          | Example                                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| event     | Connection Event              | `connect`, `progress`, `disconnect`, `originError`, `clientFiltered` |
| appID     | Application ID                | `40d67c87c6cd4b889a4fd57805225e85`                                   |
| coloName  | Colo Name                     | `SFO`                                                                |
| ipVersion | IP version used by the client | `4`, `6`                                                             |



## Operators for filtering

Use the operators below to filter data.



| Operator | Name                     | URL Encoded |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| `==`     | Equals                   | `%3D%3D`    |
| `!=`     | Does not equal           | `!%3D`      |
| `>`      | Greater Than             | `%3E`       |
| `<`      | Less Than                | `%3C`       |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `%3E%3D`    |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `%3C%3D`    |

## Analytics request structure

```txt
/api/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/analytics/events/summary?metrics=METRICS&dimensions=DIMENSIONS&filters=FILTERS&since=FROM_TS&sort=SORT&until=TO_TS&limit=LIMIT
/api/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/analytics/events/bytime?metrics=METRICS&dimensions=DIMENSIONS&filters=FILTERS&since=FROM_TS&sort=SORT&until=TO_TS&limit=LIMIT
```

* METRICS is one or more metrics (such as count) to compute
* DIMENSIONS can be used to break down the data by given attributes
* FILTERS used to filter rows by one or more dimensions (see Filters section below)
* SORT is the sort order for the result set; sort fields must be included in METRICS or DIMENSIONS
* TO\_TS is that end of time interval to query, defaults to current time
* FROM\_TS is that start of time interval to query, defaults to TO\_TS - 6 hours
* STEP is used to select time series resolution when using endpoint:
* auto or omitted - selects time step most appropriate to time interval
  * year
  * quarter
  * month
  * week
  * day
  * hour

## Analytics query example

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/analytics/events/summary?metrics=count&dimensions=event,appID&since=2018-01-01T16:57:00Z" \
