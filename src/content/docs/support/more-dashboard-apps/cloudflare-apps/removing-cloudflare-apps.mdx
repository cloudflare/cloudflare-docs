**Cloudflare Apps is deprecated and will be discontinued August 31, 2024.**

After August 31, 2024, we will be automatically uninstalling installed apps from your Cloudflare zone(s). This will not impact Cloudflare's first-party services running on your zones.

**The [Datadome app](https://datadome.co/) is the only exception to this.**

We understand that uninstalling apps might be disruptive. To address any potential issues, please review and [remove](/support/more-dashboard-apps/cloudflare-apps/removing-cloudflare-apps/) apps installed on your zones through the Cloudflare dashboard.

For any questions about the deprecation or support requests, reach out to apps-marketplace-support\[at]cloudflare.com.

We will be creating a new Apps experience. If youâ€™re interested, leave us feedback and sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sHxVMoQzZpTtuJak9).

## Overview

To uninstall an app from your site, go to **Apps** in your Cloudflare dashboard > click **Your Installed Apps** > click **Edit Install** on the App you wish to uninstall. From there, you can click **Uninstall** at the bottom of the page.

Please take a moment to provide feedback in the prompt that will appear. Your feedback allows us to help app creators improve their apps over time. Consider searching in Cloudflare Apps for an alternative App, as it is possible there is one available that will better serve you.
