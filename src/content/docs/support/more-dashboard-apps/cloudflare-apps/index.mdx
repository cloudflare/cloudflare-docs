**Cloudflare Apps is deprecated and will be discontinued August 31, 2024.**

After August 31, 2024, we will be automatically uninstalling installed apps from your Cloudflare zone(s). This will not impact Cloudflare's first-party services running on your zones.

**The [Datadome app](https://datadome.co/) is the only exception to this.**

We understand that uninstalling apps might be disruptive. To address any potential issues, please review and [remove](/support/more-dashboard-apps/cloudflare-apps/removing-cloudflare-apps/) apps installed on your zones through the Cloudflare dashboard.

For any questions about the deprecation or support requests, reach out to apps-marketplace-support\[at]cloudflare.com.

We will be creating a new Apps experience. If youâ€™re interested, leave us feedback and sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sHxVMoQzZpTtuJak9).
