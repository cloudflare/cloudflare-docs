## US State sales tax

In the US, sales tax requirements are computed based on the 9-digit postal code of the address on file for your Cloudflare account.

### Filing for US sales tax exemption

Cloudflare is required by law to maintain documentation of tax-exempt sales. If you or your company are exempt from paying sales tax, email [exemptioncertificates@cloudflare.com](mailto:exemptioncertificates@cloudflare.com) from an email address associated with your Cloudflare account and provide one of the following forms of tax-exempt documentation:

* Resale certificate
* Multi-state tax exemption certificate
* State sales tax exemption certificate
* Partial sales tax exemption certificate

After your exemption is validated, tax-exempt status is added to your Cloudflare account information. Cloudflare invoices do not contain sales tax for the duration your exemption is valid.

## Russia (VAT)

Foreign e-services suppliers are required by law to collect taxes on the supply of e-services to Russian customers. Cloudflare customers with Russian billing addresses are charged a 20% flat tax rate based on their billing address on file.

There is no tax exemption for Russian customers.
