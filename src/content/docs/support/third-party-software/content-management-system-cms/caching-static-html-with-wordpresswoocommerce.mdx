title: Caching Static HTML with WordPressWooCommerce

---

## Overview

:::note

Customers in all Cloudflare plans can configure caching HTML files. However, Business and Enterprise customers can bypass HTML caching when a cookie is sent with a request *Bypass Cache on Cookie* setting using Cloudflare Page Rules. 
:::

This allows for static HTML to be cached at our edge, with no need for it to be regenerated from request to request. 

Enterprise Cloudflare customers can use *Custom Cache Keys* to take their performance further, contact your Customer Success Manager for more details.

***

## Prerequisites

Before starting - be sure that Cloudflare is set to respect `Cache-Control` headers from your origin web server; otherwise, you may find `Cache-Control` headers are overridden by Cloudflare with the value set in the **Browser Cache TTL** option. To set the **Respect Existing Headers** option:

1. Log into your Cloudflare account.
2. Click the **Caching** app.
3. Scroll down to **Browser Cache TTL**, and select the **Respect Existing Headers** value.

## Cache Static HTML with Cloudflare Page Rules

1\. Log in to your Cloudflare account.

2\. Go to **Rules >** **Page Rules** and select **Create Page Rule**.

3\. Set the page rule to match your WordPress installation path. If your site is at [https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com), the rule would be [https://www.example.com.](https://www.example.com./)

4\. Select the appropriate settings to cache static HTML:

* *Cache Everything* instructs Cloudflare to cache static HTML.
* When the *Bypass Cache on Cookie* rule matches the criteria you set, Cloudflare won't cache HTML ([though static images and other files will still be cached](/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/)). Depending on whether you're using raw WordPress, or WooCommerce, you should use one of the configurations below:

:::caution


| WordPress type             | Cookie configuration                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| WordPress (native)         | wp-.\*\|wordpress.\*\|comment\_.\*                   |
| WordPress with WooCommerce | wp-.\*\|wordpress.\*\|comment\_.\*\|woocommerce\_.\* |


:::

* Finally, setting *Edge Cache TTL* will define the maximum period of time Cloudflare should keep cached files before getting them back from the origin web server. Even after setting a long Edge Cache TTL time, you can still [manually clear the cache](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-How-do-I-purge-my-cache-) or use our WordPress plugin to automatically manage cache purging.

5\. Click **Save and Deploy** to finish. 

Additionally, by using the [*Automatic Cache Management* feature of the Cloudflare WordPress plugin](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002708027-What-does-Automatic-Cache-Management-in-the-Cloudflare-Plugin-do-), you are able to automatically purge the cache for your site after your site changes (i.e. changing/customizing your theme or editing, deleting or creating a post, attachment or page).
