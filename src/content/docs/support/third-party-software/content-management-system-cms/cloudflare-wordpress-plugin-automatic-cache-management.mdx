title: Cloudflare WordPress Plugin Automatic Cache Management

---

## Overview

The Cloudflare WordPress plugin contains a feature called Automatic Cache Management. When a user adds, edits, or deletes a post, page, attachment, or comment - any associated URLs are purged from the Cloudflare cache.

When you switch a theme or customise a theme within the WordPress admin panel, the cache will automatically be cleared too.

Automatic Cache Management uses native hooks built into WordPress. The Cloudflare WordPress plugin purges the following cache URLs:

* deleted\_post
* edit\_post
* delete\_attachment
* autoptimize\_action\_cachepurged (for compatibility with the Autoptimize WordPress plugin)
* switch\_theme
* customize\_save\_after

:::note

This feature works great [when caching HTML on
WordPress](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/236166048) with
the Bypass Cache on Cookie setting.
