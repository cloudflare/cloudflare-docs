## Getting started with WordPress.com and Cloudflare

Cloudflare and WordPress.com are partnering to offer customers Cloudflare's performance and security solutions with WordPress.com's web-hosting platform. Getting started is easy.

1\. Add your WordPress site to Cloudflare. Visit [Creating a Cloudflare account and adding a website](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164) for more information.

During this process, Cloudflare scans your existing WordPress.com DNS records and displays them. The records will look similar to the examples below.

- `A example.com 192.0.78.12`
- `A example.com 192.0.78.13`

WordPress.com does not guarantee the IP address will never change. For maximum uptime, you should complete the following:

2\. Find your `<site>.wordpress.com` domain from the [Manage Domains](https://wordpress.com/domains/manage) page. The domain will look like `examplecom.wordpress.com`, i.e. your domain with non-alphanumeric characters removed.

3\. Enter the domain into your browser's address bar to make sure the domain is correct.

4\. Add the record `CNAME @ examplecom.wordpress.com`.

5\. Remove the A records.

Congratulations! Your site is now accelerated and protected by Cloudflare.

## Enabling additional Cloudflare products

## **Cloudflare Web Analytics (Free)**

Cloudflare Web Analytics gives web creators the information they need in a simple, clean way that doesn't sacrifice their visitors' privacy. One of the goals of the partnership is to bring a privacy-first analytics solution to WordPress.com sites.

### Cloudflare

1\. [Open your dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select the Account menu > **Account Home**.

2\. On the Account homepage, select **Web Analytics** from the bottom, right of the page.

3\. Enter the hostname to use with Web Analytics. Typically the hostname is your top-level domain, like `example.com`.

5\. Select **Click to copy** under **Copy JS Snippet**.

### WordPress

## **Automatic Platform Optimization for WordPress.com ($5/month, included with Pro and Business plans)**

Cloudflare's [Automatic Platform Optimization](https://www.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/wordpress/) for WordPress.com is the easiest way to drastically speed up your WordPress.com site. With the [APO plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/), Cloudflare accelerates your WordPress.com site by intelligently caching dynamic content, which means fast performance for your visitors no matter where they are. Find out more from our [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimizations-starting-with-wordpress/) and [support article](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049822312-Understanding-Automatic-Platform-Optimization-APO-with-WordPress).

### **Requirements**

:::caution

The [Automatic Platform Optimization
(APO)](https://www.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/wordpress/)
feature requires that you be on a [Full
Setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/)
using Cloudflare nameservers.
:::

- Cloudflare free plan + $5/month APO add-on or a Pro or Business plan subscription (includes APO)
- WordPress.com Business plan or above (requires plugins)

### **Install and enable APO**

1\. From WordPress, install the [Cloudflare WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/) on your WordPress website or update to the latest version (3.8.2 or higher).

2\. [Authenticate the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/#installation) to connect to Cloudflare if you have not already done so.

3\. From the Home screen of the Cloudflare section, turn on Automatic Platform Optimization.

For more details, refer to [Understanding Automatic Platform Optimization (APO) with WordPress](/automatic-platform-optimization/).

## Troubleshooting

### **How do I verify that Cloudflare is now my DNS provider on record?**

1\. Visit [https://dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/#A/s-steiner.com).

2\. From the dropdown under **DNS Check, s**elect NS record.

3\. In the text field, enter your domain name and click **Search**.

4\. Verify that your Cloudflare nameservers display.

### **How can I confirm APO is up and running?**

In a terminal, use the following cURL. The header `'accept: text/html'` is important

```sh
curl -svo /dev/null -A "CF" 'https://example.com/' -H 'accept: text/html' 2>&1 | grep 'cf-cache-status\|cf-edge\|cf-apo-via'
```

```sh output
< cf-cache-status: HIT
< cf-apo-via: cache
< cf-edge-cache: cache,platform=wordpress
```

As always, `cf-cache-status` displays if the asset hit the cache or was considered dynamic and served from the origin.

- The `cf-apo-via` header returns the APO status for the given request.
- The `cf-edge-cache` header means the WordPress plugin is installed and enabled.

### How can I verify APO and the WordPress.com integration works?

1\. Publish a change on your WordPress website.

2\. Refresh the page twice.

3\. You should see a change. The page should be cached with `cf-cache-status: HIT` and `cf-apo-via: cache` in a response header.
