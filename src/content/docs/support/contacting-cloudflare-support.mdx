## Verifying your identity

*(For Enterprise Emergency Phone Support)*

For account security, you must verify your identity and account ownership in the Cloudflare dashboard before discussing account settings and sensitive details with Cloudflare Support. There are two verification options:

* a single-use token that automatically refreshes every thirty (30) seconds, or
* an [authenticator app token](/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/2fa/#configure-totp-mobile-application-authentication-for-two-factor-cloudflare-login) on your mobile device.

### Authenticating your account

1\. Log into your Cloudflare account.

2\. In the upper right corner of the Cloudflare dashboard, click **Support** and select **Contact Support**.
