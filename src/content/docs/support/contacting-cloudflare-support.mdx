## Verifying your identity

*(For Enterprise Emergency Phone Support)*

For account security, you must verify your identity and account ownership in the Cloudflare dashboard before discussing account settings and sensitive details with Cloudflare Support. There are two verification options:

* a single-use token that automatically refreshes every thirty (30) seconds, or
* an [authenticator app token](/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/2fa/#configure-totp-mobile-application-authentication-for-two-factor-cloudflare-login) on your mobile device.

### Authenticating your account

1\. Log into your Cloudflare account.

2\. In the upper right corner of the Cloudflare dashboard, click **Support** and select **Contact Support**.

3\. On the right-hand panel there is a section for *Emergency Phone Support Hotline*.

4\. To authenticate using a single-use token, click **Get a single-use token**. A pop-up window will appear with your Unique Customer Id and One Time Passcode. The code automatically refreshes every 30 seconds.
