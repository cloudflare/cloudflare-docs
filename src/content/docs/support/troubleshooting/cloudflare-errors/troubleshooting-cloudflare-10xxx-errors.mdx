***

## Error 10056: The add list items operation contains different types of list items

This error occurs when there are different types of list items (for example, IP addresses, hostnames, and URL redirects) in a single operation to add items to a list. The error may occur for an IP list, a hostname list, or a Bulk Redirect List.

### **Resolution**

Remove the list items that do not apply to the list type. This means:
