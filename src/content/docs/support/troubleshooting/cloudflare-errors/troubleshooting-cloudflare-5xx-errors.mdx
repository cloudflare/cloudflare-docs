import { GlossaryTooltip } from "~/components";

When troubleshooting most 5XX errors, the correct course of action is to first contact your hosting provider or site administrator to troubleshoot and gather data.

:::note

Cloudflare Support only assists the domain owner to resolve issues. If you are a site visitor, report the problem to the site owner.

:::

## Required error details for hosting provider

When contacting your hosting provider, give them the following information:

1. Specific 5XX error code and message.
2. Time and timezone the 5XX error occurred.
3. URL that resulted in the HTTP 5XX error (for example: `https://www.example.com/images/icons/image1.png`).

The error cause is not always found in the origin server error logs. Check logs of all load balancers, caches, proxies, or firewalls between Cloudflare and the origin web server.

Additional details to provide to your hosting provider or site administrator are listed within each error description below. Cloudflare [Custom Error Pages](/support/more-dashboard-apps/cloudflare-custom-pages/configuring-custom-pages-error-and-challenge/) change the appearance of default error pages discussed in this article.

## Error analytics

Error Analytics per domain are available within [Zone Analytics](/analytics/account-and-zone-analytics/zone-analytics/). Error Analytics allows insight into overall errors by HTTP error code and provides the URLs, source IP addresses, and Cloudflare data centers needed to diagnose and resolve the issue. Error Analytics are based on a 1% traffic sample.

To view Error Analytics:

- Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.
- Click the appropriate Cloudflare **account** for your site, then pick the **domain**.
- Next, click the **Analytics & Logs** app icon.
- Click **Add filter**, select **Edge status code** or **Origin status code** and choose any 5xx error code that you want to diagnose.

## Error 500: internal server error

Error 500 generally indicates an issue with your origin web server. _Error establishing database_ _connection_ is a common HTTP 500 error message generated by your origin web server. [Contact your hosting provider](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to resolve.

**Resolution**

[Provide details to your hosting provider](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to assist troubleshooting the issue.

However, if the 500 error contains "cloudflare" or "cloudflare-nginx" in the HTML response body, provide [Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) with the following information:

1. Your domain name
2. The time and timezone of the 500 error occurrence
3. The output of `www.example.com/cdn-cgi/trace` from the browser where the 500 error was observed (replace `www.example.com` with your actual domain and hostname)

:::note

If you observe blank or white pages when visiting your website, confirm
whether the issue occurs when [temporarily pausing
Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/)
and contact your hosting provider for assistance.

## Error 502 bad gateway or error 504 gateway timeout

An HTTP 502 or 504 error occurs when Cloudflare is unable to establish contact with your origin web server.

There are two possible causes:

- (Most common cause) [502/504 from your origin web server](#502504-from-your-origin-web-server)
- [502/504 from Cloudflare](#502504-from-cloudflare)

### 502/504 from your origin web server

Cloudflare returns a Cloudflare-branded HTTP 502 or 504 error when your origin web server responds with a standard HTTP 502 bad gateway or 504 gateway timeout error:

![Example of a Cloudflare-branded error 502.](~/assets/images/support/image1.png)

**Resolution**

Contact your hosting provider to troubleshoot these common causes at your origin web server:

- Ensure the origin server responds to requests for the hostname and domain within the visitor's URL that generated the 502 or 504 error.
- Investigate excessive server loads, crashes, or network failures.
- Identify applications or services that timed out or were blocked.

### 502/504 from Cloudflare

A 502 or 504 error originating from Cloudflare appears as follows:

![Example of an unbranded error 502.](~/assets/images/support/image5.png)

If the error does not mention `cloudflare`, contact your hosting provider for assistance on [502/504 errors from your origin](#502504-from-your-origin-web-server).

This error can be returned in case of a compression issue at the origin, for example the origin server is serving gzip encoded compressed content but is not updating the `content-length` header, or the origin is serving broken gzip compressed content.
You can try to disable compression at your origin to confirm if this is the root cause of the errors.

Otherwise, under certain conditions it is possible a given Data Center observes a sudden increase of traffic.
In these cases our automated processes will move traffic away from such location to a different Data Center making sure there is no impact for our customers.
These traffic adjustments are mostly seamless and take only a few seconds.
Still, it is possible that during this automated process some clients observe added latency and HTTP 502 errors.
You can find more information about our automated traffic management tools [in this blogpost](https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-traffic-manager).

**Resolution**

If you still need our Support team to help you investigate further, please provide these required details to [Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to avoid delays processing your inquiry:

1. Time and timezone the issue occurred.
2. URL that resulted in the HTTP 502 or 504 response (for example: `https://www.example.com/images/icons/image1.png`).
3. Output from browsing to `<YOUR_DOMAIN>/cdn-cgi/trace`.

---

## Error 503: service temporarily unavailable

HTTP error 503 occurs when your origin web server is overloaded. There are two possible causes discernible by error message:

- Error doesn't contain `cloudflare` or `cloudflare-nginx` in the HTML response body.

**Resolution**: Contact your hosting provider to verify if they rate limit requests to your origin web server.

- Error contains `cloudflare` or `cloudflare-nginx` in the HTML response body.

**Resolution**: A connectivity issue occurred in a Cloudflare data center. Provide [Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) with the following information:

1. Your domain name
2. The time and timezone of the 503 error occurrence
3. The output of `www.example.com/cdn-cgi/trace` from the browser where the 503 error was observed (replace `www.example.com` with your actual domain and hostname)

---

## Error 520: web server returns an unknown error

Error 520 occurs when the origin server returns an empty, unknown, or unexpected response to Cloudflare.

**Resolution**

:::note

A quick workaround while further investigating 520 errors is to either
make the record [DNS-only](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records)
in the Cloudflare **DNS** app or [temporarily pause Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/).
:::

[Contact your hosting provider or site administrator](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) and request a review of your origin web server error logs for crashes and to check for these common causes:

- Origin web server application crashes
- [Cloudflare IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) not allowed at your origin
- Headers exceeding 16 KB (typically due to too many cookies)
- An empty response from the origin web server that lacks an HTTP status code or response body
- Missing response headers or origin web server not returning [proper HTTP error responses](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml).

:::note

520 errors are prevalent with certain PHP applications that crash the
origin web server.
:::

If HTTP/2 is enabled at your origin web server, please check and make sure HTTP/2 is correctly configured.
Cloudflare connects to servers who announce support of HTTP/2 connections via [ALPN](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-http2).
If the origin web server accepts the HTTP/2 connection but then doesn't respect or support the protocol, an HTTP Error 520 will be returned.
You can disable the [HTTP/2 to Origin](/speed/optimization/protocol/http2-to-origin/#disable-http2-to-origin) setting on the Cloudflare Dashboard under Speed -> Optimization -> Protocol Optimization and check your origin web server configuration further.

If 520 errors continue after contacting your hosting provider or site administrator, provide the following information to [Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/):

- Full URL(s) of the resource requested when the error occurred
- Cloudflare **cf-ray** from the 520 error message
- Output from `http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/cdn-cgi/trace`
- Two [HAR files](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#generate-a-har-file):
  - one with Cloudflare enabled on your website, and
  - the other with [Cloudflare temporarily disabled](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/).

---

## Error 521: web server is down

Error 521 occurs when the origin web server refuses connections from Cloudflare. Security solutions at your origin may block legitimate connections from certain [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

The two most common causes of 521 errors are:

- Offlined origin web server application
- Blocked Cloudflare requests

**Resolution**

[Contact your site administrator or hosting provider](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to eliminate these common causes:

- Ensure your origin web server is responsive
- Review origin web server error logs to identify web server application crashes or outages.
- Confirm [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) are not blocked or rate limited
- Allow all [Cloudflare IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) in your origin web server's firewall or other security software
- Confirm that — if you have your **SSL/TLS mode** set to **Full** or **Full (Strict**) — you have installed a [Cloudflare Origin Certificate](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca)
- Find additional troubleshooting information on the [Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/community-tip-fixing-error-521-web-server-is-down/42461).

---

## Error 522: connection timed out

Error 522 occurs when Cloudflare times out contacting the origin web server. Two different timeouts cause HTTP error 522 depending on when they occur between Cloudflare and the origin web server:

1. Before a connection is established, the origin web server does not return a SYN+ACK to Cloudflare within 15 seconds of Cloudflare sending a SYN.
2. After a connection is established, the origin web server doesn't acknowledge (ACK) Cloudflare's resource request within 90 seconds.

**Resolution**

[Contact your hosting provider](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to check the following common causes at your origin web server:

- (Most common cause) [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) are rate limited or blocked in .htaccess, iptables, or firewalls. Confirm your hosting provider allows Cloudflare IP addresses.
- An overloaded or offline origin web server drops incoming requests.
- [Keepalives](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/overview.html) are disabled at the origin web server.
- The origin IP address in your Cloudflare **DNS** app does not match the IP address currently provisioned to your origin web server by your hosting provider.
- Packets were dropped at your origin web server.

If you are using [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/), verify that you have a custom domain set up and that your CNAME record is pointed to your [custom Pages domain](/pages/configuration/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain).

If none of the above leads to a resolution, request the following information from your hosting provider or site administrator before [contacting Cloudflare support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/):

- An [MTR or traceroute](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#perform-a-traceroute) from your origin web server to a [Cloudflare IP address](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips) that most commonly connected to your origin web server before the issue occurred. Identify a connecting Cloudflare IP recorded in the origin web server logs.
- Details from the hosting provider's investigation such as pertinent logs or conversations with the hosting provider.

---

## Error 523: origin is unreachable

Error 523 occurs when Cloudflare cannot contact your origin web server. This typically occurs when a network device between Cloudflare and the origin web server doesn't have a route to the origin's IP address.

**Resolution** [Contact your hosting provider](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to exclude the following common causes at your origin web server:

- Confirm the correct origin IP address is listed for A or AAAA records within your Cloudflare DNS app.
- Troubleshoot Internet routing issues between your origin and Cloudflare, or with the origin itself.

If none of the above leads to a resolution, request the following information from your hosting provider or site administrator:

- An [MTR or traceroute](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#perform-a-traceroute) from your origin web server to a [Cloudflare IP address](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips) that most commonly connected to your origin web server before the issue occurred. Identify a connecting Cloudflare IP from the logs of the origin web server.

---

## Error 524: a timeout occurred

Error 524 usually indicates that Cloudflare successfully connected to the origin web server, but the origin did not provide an HTTP response before the default 100 second [Proxy Read Timeout](/fundamentals/reference/connection-limits/). This can happen if the origin server is taking too long because it has too much work to do - e.g. a large data query, or because the server is struggling for resources and cannot return any data in time.

Error 524 can also indicate that Cloudflare successfully connected to the origin web server to write data, but the write did not complete before the 30 second [Proxy Write Timeout](/fundamentals/reference/connection-limits/).

:::note

A 524 occurs if the origin web server
acknowledges (_ACK_) the resource request after the connection has been
established, but does not send a timely response.
:::

**Resolution**

Here are the options we'd suggest to work around this issue:

- Implement status polling of large HTTP processes to avoid hitting this error.
- [Contact your hosting provider](#required-error-details-for-hosting-provider) to exclude the following common causes at your origin web server:
  - A long-running process on the origin web server.
  - An overloaded origin web server.

:::note

Logging request response time at your origin web server helps identify
the cause of resource slowness. Contact your hosting provider or site
administrator for assistance in adjusting log formats or search for
related logging documentation for your brand of web server such as
[Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html)
or
[Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html#log_format).
:::

- Enterprise customers can increase the 524 timeout up to 6,000 seconds using the [Edit zone setting](/api/operations/zone-settings-edit-single-setting) endpoint (`proxy_read_timeout` setting). If your content can be cached, you may also choose to use a [Cache Rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#proxy-read-timeout-enterprise-only) with the `Proxy Read Timeout` setting selected instead in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

:::note

If the timeouts are on write requests, the [Proxy Write Timeout](/fundamentals/reference/connection-limits/) of 30 seconds cannot be adjusted.
:::

- If you regularly run HTTP requests that take over 100 seconds to complete (for example large data exports), move those processes behind a subdomain not proxied (grey clouded) in the Cloudflare **DNS** app.

:::note

Please note that you may observe a 1 second difference between the timeout you've set and the actual time at which the Error 524 is returned.
This is expected, it's due to the current work on implementing [Pingora, our new proxy](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/).
As a workaround you can simply set the timeout to 1 second more (121 seconds instead of 120 seconds for example).
:::

## Error 525: SSL handshake failed

525 errors indicate that the SSL handshake between Cloudflare and the origin web server failed. Error 525 occurs when these two conditions are true:

1. The [SSL handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/) fails between Cloudflare and the origin web server, and
2. [_Full_ or _Full (Strict)_](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes) **SSL** is set in the **Overview** tab of your Cloudflare **SSL/TLS** app.

:::note

If your hosting provider frequently changes your origin web server's IP
address, refer to Cloudflare's documentation on [dynamic DNS
updates](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/managing-dynamic-ip-addresses).
:::

**Resolution**

Contact your hosting provider to exclude the following common causes at your origin web server:

- No valid SSL certificate installed
- Port 443 (or other custom secure port) is not open
- No <GlossaryTooltip term="Server Name Indication (SNI)">SNI</GlossaryTooltip> support
- The [cipher suites](/ssl/origin-configuration/cipher-suites/) presented by Cloudflare to the origin do not match the cipher suites supported by the origin web server

:::note

If 525 errors occur intermittently, review the origin web server error
logs to determine the cause. Configure Apache to [log mod_ssl
errors](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/DebuggingSSLProblems#Enable_SSL_logging).
Also, nginx includes SSL errors in its standard error log, but may
possibly require [an increased log
level](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/).
:::

**Additional checks**

- Check if you have a certificate installed on your origin server. You can check [this article](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/gathering-information-for-troubleshooting-sites/#troubleshoot-requests-with-curl) for more details on how to run some tests. In case you don't have any certificate, you can create and install our free [Cloudflare origin CA certificate](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca). Using Origin CA certificates allows you to encrypt traffic between Cloudflare and your origin web server.
- [Review the cipher suites](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/) your server is using to ensure they match what is supported by Cloudflare.
- Check your server's error logs from the timestamps you see 525s to ensure there are errors that could be causing the connection to be reset during the SSL handshake.

---

## Error 526: invalid SSL certificate

### Error 526

Error 526 occurs when these two conditions are true:

1. Cloudflare cannot validate the SSL certificate at your origin web server, and
2. [_Full SSL (Strict)_](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) **SSL** is set in the **Overview** tab of your Cloudflare **SSL/TLS** app.

**Resolution**

:::note

For a potential quick fix, set **SSL** to _Full_ instead of _Full
(strict)_ in the **Overview** tab of your Cloudflare **SSL/TLS** app for
the domain.
:::

Request your server administrator or hosting provider to review the origin web server's SSL certificates and verify that:

- Certificate is not expired
- Certificate is not revoked
- Certificate is signed by a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) (not self-signed)
- The requested or target domain name and hostname are in the certificate's **Common Name** or **Subject Alternative Name**
- Your origin web server accepts connections over port SSL port 443
- [Temporarily pause Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/) and visit [https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=www.example.com](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=www.example.com) (replace `www.example.com` with your hostname and domain) to verify no issues exists with the origin SSL certificate:

![Screen showing an SSL certificate with no errors.](~/assets/images/support/hc-import-troubleshooting_5xx_errors_sslshopper_output.png)

If the origin server uses a self-signed certificate, configure the domain to use _Full_ _SSL_ instead of _Full SSL (Strict)_. Refer to [recommended SSL settings for your origin](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes).

### Error 526 in the Zero Trust context

When using [Cloudflare Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/), an HTTP Error 526 might be returned in the [following cases](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#i-see-error-526-when-browsing-to-a-website):

- **An untrusted certificate is presented from the origin to Gateway.** Gateway will consider a certificate is untrusted if any of these conditions are true:

  - The server certificate issuer is unknown or is not trusted by the service.
  - The server certificate is revoked and fails a CRL check.
  - There is at least one expired certificate in the certificate chain for the server certificate.
  - The common name on the certificate does not match the URL you are trying to reach.
  - The common name on the certificate contains invalid characters (such as underscores). Gateway uses [BoringSSL](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search?SearchMode=Basic&Vendor=Google&CertificateStatus=Active&ValidationYear=0) to validate certificates. Chrome's [validation logic](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/net/cert/x509_certificate.cc#429) allows non-RFC 1305 compliant certificates, which is why the website may load when you turn off WARP.

- **The connection from Gateway to the origin is insecure.** Gateway does not trust origins which:

  - Only offer insecure cipher suites (such as RC4, RC4-MD5, or 3DES). You can use the [SSL Server Test tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html) to check which ciphers are supported by the origin.
  - Do not support [FIPS-compliant ciphers](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#cipher-suites) (if you have enabled [FIPS compliance mode](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#fips-compliance)). In order to load the page, you can either disable FIPS mode or create a Do Not Inspect policy for this host (which has the effect of disabling FIPS compliance for this origin).
  - Redirect all HTTPS requests to HTTP.

### Error 526 in the Workers context

Workers subrequests to any hostname outside of your Cloudflare zone that is not proxied by Cloudflare are always made using the **[Full (strict)](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/)** SSL mode, even when the Workers zone is configured otherwise.

As a result, a valid SSL certificate is required at the origin.

## Error 530

HTTP error 530 is returned with an accompanying 1XXX error displayed. Search for the specific [1XXX error](/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-1xxx-errors) for troubleshooting information.

Enabling [Load Balancing](/load-balancing/) in China will cause a `530` error.
