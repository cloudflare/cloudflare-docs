There are two ways to set up Magic WAN:

- **Automatically**: Through Magic WAN Connector (preferred). You can use the hardware or the virtual versions of Magic WAN Connector. The latter, you can install on your own machines. Refer to [Configure with Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/) for more information.
- **Manually**: Through a third-party device. Read the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below before following the steps in [Manual configuration](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/).

## Prerequisites

Magic WAN is an Enterprise-only product. [Contact Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/) to acquire Magic WAN. If you plan on using Magic WAN Connector to automatically onboard your locations to Cloudflare, you will need to purchase Magic WAN first.

The preferred way to onboard your network locations to Cloudflare One is through [Magic WAN Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/). The list of prerequisites below is only for customers planning to connect manually to Cloudflare with a third-party device.

### Use compatible tunnel endpoint routers

Magic WAN relies on <GlossaryTooltip term="GRE tunnel" link="/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/">GRE</GlossaryTooltip> and <GlossaryTooltip term="IPsec tunnel" link="/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#ipsec-tunnels">IPsec tunnels</GlossaryTooltip> to transmit packets from Cloudflareâ€™s global network to your origin network. To ensure compatibility with Magic WAN, the routers at your tunnel endpoints must:

- Allow configuration of at least one tunnel per Internet service provider (ISP).
- Support <GlossaryTooltip term="maximum segment size (MSS)">maximum segment size (MSS)</GlossaryTooltip> clamping.
- Support the configuration parameters for IPsec mentioned in [IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters).
