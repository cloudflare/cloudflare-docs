Magic WAN allows you to achieve any-to-any connectivity across branch and retail sites and data centers, with Cloudflare connectivity cloud.

<Card icon="setting" title="Magic WAN set up options">
	- **Automatically**: Through Magic WAN Connector (preferred method). You can
	choose between the hardware version or the virtual version of the Magic WAN
	Connector. The virtual version can be installed on your own machines. Refer to
	[Configure with Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/) for more
	information. - **Manually**: Through a third-party device. Read the
	[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below before following the steps in [Manual
	configuration](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/).
</Card>

## Before you begin

Magic WAN is an Enterprise-only product. [Contact Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/) to acquire Magic WAN. If you plan on using Magic WAN Connector to automatically onboard your locations to Cloudflare, you will need to purchase Magic WAN first.

:::note
The list of prerequisites below is only for customers planning to connect manually to Cloudflare with a third-party device. If you plan on using Magic WAN Connector, refer to [Configure with Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/).

## Prerequisites

Adding changes here because we need to add some stuff.

### Use compatible tunnel endpoint routers

Another change here

Magic WAN relies on <GlossaryTooltip term="GRE tunnel" link="/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/">GRE</GlossaryTooltip> and <GlossaryTooltip term="IPsec tunnel" link="/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#ipsec-tunnels">IPsec tunnels</GlossaryTooltip> to transmit packets from Cloudflareâ€™s global network to your origin network. To ensure compatibility with Magic WAN, the routers at your tunnel endpoints must:

- Allow configuration of at least one tunnel per Internet service provider (ISP).
- Support <GlossaryTooltip term="maximum segment size (MSS)">maximum segment size (MSS)</GlossaryTooltip> clamping.
- Support the configuration parameters for IPsec mentioned in [IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters).

<Render
	file="prerequisites/maximum-segment-size"
	product="magic-transit"
	params={{
		one: "Magic WAN",
		two: "To accommodate the additional header data, **you must set the MSS value to 1436 bytes at your tunnel interfaces** (not the physical interfaces).",
	}}
/>
