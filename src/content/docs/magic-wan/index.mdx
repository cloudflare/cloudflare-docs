Improve security and performance for your entire corporate networking, reducing cost and operation complexity.
</Description>

<Plan type="enterprise" />

Magic WAN provides secure, performant connectivity and routing for your entire corporate networking, reducing cost and operation complexity. [Magic Firewall](/magic-firewall/) integrates smoothly with Magic WAN, enabling you to enforce network firewall policies at Cloudflare's global network, across traffic from any entity within your network.

With Magic WAN, you can securely connect any traffic source — data centers, offices, devices, cloud properties — to Cloudflare’s network and configure routing policies to get the bits where they need to go, all within one SaaS solution.

Magic WAN supports a variety of <GlossaryTooltip term="on-ramp">on-ramps</GlossaryTooltip> including any device that supports <GlossaryTooltip term="anycast">anycast</GlossaryTooltip> <GlossaryTooltip term="GRE tunnel">GRE</GlossaryTooltip> or <GlossaryTooltip term="IPsec tunnel">IPsec</GlossaryTooltip> tunnels. To make it easier to onboard your cloud properties, you can use [Magic Cloud Networking](/magic-wan/configuration/magic-cloud-networking/), which automates the process of creating on-ramps from your cloud networks.

Refer to [On-ramps](/magic-wan/on-ramps/) for a full list of supported on-ramps.
