Prioritized traffic allows you to define which applications Magic WAN Connector should process first. Applications not in the list will be queued behind prioritized traffic.

Similarly to breakout traffic, prioritized traffic also works via DNS requests inspection.

:::caution[Warning]
Prioritized traffic will not work for applications that use DNS-over-HTTPs.
:::

## Add an application

You need to configure Prioritized traffic for each of your existing sites, as it is a per-site configuration.

<Render
	file="connector/app-aware-policies/add-app"
	params={{ one: "Prioritized traffic" }}
/>

6. Select one or more applications that should take precedence over other traffic. You can also use the search box.
7. Select **Add applications**.

The traffic for the applications you chose are now processed first by Connector.

## Delete an application

<Render
	file="connector/app-aware-policies/delete-app"
	params={{ one: "Prioritized traffic" }}
/>
