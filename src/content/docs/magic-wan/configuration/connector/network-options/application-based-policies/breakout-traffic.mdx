import { Render, TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components";

Breakout traffic allows you to define which applications should bypass Cloudflare’s security filtering, and go directly to the Internet. It works via DNS requests inspection. This means that if your network is caching DNS requests, Breakout traffic will only take effect after you cache entries expire and your client issues a new DNS request that the Magic WAN Connector can detect. This can take several minutes.

:::caution
Breakout traffic will not work for applications that use DNS-over-HTTPs.

_In the graph above, Applications 1 and 2 are configured to bypass Cloudflare's security filtering, and go straight to the Internet_

:::note[A note on security]
We recommend routing all traffic through our global network for comprehensive security filtering and access controls. However, there may be specific cases where you want a subset of traffic to bypass Cloudflare’s security filtering and route it directly to the Internet. You can scope this breakout traffic to specific applications from the Cloudflare dashboard.

Refer to [Traffic steering](/magic-wan/reference/traffic-steering/) to learn how Cloudflare routes traffic.

## Add an application

You need to configure Breakout traffic for each of your existing sites, as it is a per-site configuration.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render
	file="connector/app-aware-policies/add-app"
	params={{ featureName: "Breakout traffic" }}
/>

6. Select one or more applications that should bypass Cloudflare filtering from the list. You can also use the search box.
7. Select **Add applications**.

The traffic for that application will now go directly to the Internet and bypass Cloudflare's filtering.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="connector/account-id-api-key" />

1.  Send a [`GET` request](/api/operations/magic-account-apps-list-apps) to list the applications associated with an account.

    Example:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/apps \
    --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
    --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
    ```

    ```json output
    {
    	"result": [
    		{
    			"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
    			"name": "<APP_NAME>",
    			"type": "<TYPE_OF_APP>",
    			"hostnames": ["<HOSTNAME1.com>", "<HOSTNAME2.info>"]
    		}
    	],
    	"success": true,
    	"errors": [],
    	"messages": []
    }
    ```

    Take note of the `"managed_app_id"` value for any application you want to configure.

2.  Send a [`POST` request](/api/operations/magic-site-app-configs-add-app-config) to add new apps the breakout traffic policy.

    Example:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs \
    --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
    --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
    	"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
    	"breakout": true
    }'
    ```

    ```json output
    {
    	"result": {
    		"id": "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353",
    		"site_id": "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353",
    		"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
    		"breakout": true
    	},
    	"success": true,
    	"errors": [],
    	"messages": []
    }
    ```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Delete an application

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render
	file="connector/app-aware-policies/delete-app"
	params={{ featureName: "Breakout traffic" }}
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="connector/account-id-api-key" />

1. Send a [`GET` request](/api/operations/magic-site-app-configs-list-app-configs) to list the applications associated with a site.

   Example:

   ```bash
   curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

   ```json output
   {
   	"result": [
   		{
   			"id": "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353",
   			"site_id": "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353",
   			"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
   			"breakout": true
   		}
   	],
   	"success": true,
   	"errors": [],
   	"messages": []
   }
   ```

Take note of the `"id"` value for the application that want to delete.

2. Send a [`DELETE` request](/api/operations/magic-site-app-configs-delete-app-config) to delete an application from the breakout traffic policy.

   ```bash
   curl --request DELETE \
   https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs/{id} \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

   ```json output
   {
   	"result": {
   		"id": "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353",
   		"site_id": "023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353",
   		"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
   		"breakout": true
   	},
   	"success": true,
   	"errors": [],
   	"messages": []
   }
   ```
