description: Learn how to set up when Magic WAN Connector can update its systems.

---

The Interrupt window defines when Magic WAN Connector can update its systems. When Magic WAN Connector is updating, this may result in an interruption to existing connections. Set up a time window that minimizes disruption to your sites.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Configuration** > **Connectors**.
3. Select the Connector for which you want to set up the update window > **Edit**.
4. In **Interrupt window**, select the most appropriate time for the Connector to update its systems:
   - **Timezone**: Select the time zone for the Connector to update.
   - **Start time**: Choose an hour for the Connector to start updating. Cloudflare recommends you choose an hour when there is minimal activity in your network, to avoid potential disruptions.
   - **Duration**: Duration indicates the time window during which the Connector is scheduled to update. For example, if you configure your Connector to update at `22:00` and specify a **Duration** of `4 hours`, the Connector will attempt to update within the four-hour period following `22:00`.
