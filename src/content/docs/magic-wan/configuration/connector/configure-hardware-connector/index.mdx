## Before you begin

## Prerequisites

You need to purchase [Magic WAN](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/) before you can purchase and use the Magic WAN Connector. The Magic WAN Connector can function as your primary edge device for your network, or be deployed in-line with existing network gear.

You also need to purchase a Magic WAN Connector before you can start configuring your settings in the Cloudflare dashboard. After buying a Magic WAN Connector, the device will be registered with your Cloudflare account and show up in your Cloudflare dashboard.

Contact your account representative to learn more about purchasing options for the Magic WAN Connector device.

---

## Port speeds

The hardware version of the Magic WAN connector includes two [SFP+ ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Form-factor_Pluggable) that support 10G throughput, as well as six RJ45 ports that support 1G throughput.

Refer to [SFP+ port information](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/configure-hardware-connector/sfp-port-information/) for details on this topic.

## Set up your Magic WAN Connector

### Device installation

There are several deployment options for Magic WAN Connector. Connector can act like a DHCP server for your local network, or integrate with your local setup and have static IP addresses assigned to it.

When Connector acts like the WAN router for your site, deployment will be something like this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
accTitle: Magic WAN Connector set up as a DHCP server, and connecting to the Internet.
    a(Magic WAN Connector)--> b(Internet) --> c(Cloudflare)

    subgraph Customer site
    d[LAN 1] --> a
    e[LAN 2] --> a
    end

    classDef orange fill:#f48120,color: black
    class a,c orange
```

<br />

In the example below, the Connector sits behind the WAN router in your site, and on-ramps only some of the existing LANs to Cloudflare.

    subgraph Customer site
    d[LAN 1] --> a
    e[LAN 2] --> a
    g(LAN 3) --> b
    h(LAN 4) --> b
    end

    classDef orange fill:#f48120,color: black
    class a,i orange
```

#### Firewall settings required

If there is a firewall deployed upstream of the Magic WAN Connector, configure the firewall to allow the following traffic:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
| Protocol/port | Destination IP/URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- |--- |
| `UDP/53` | DNS destination IP `1.1.1.1` | Needed to allow DNS traffic to Cloudflare DNS servers. Cloudflare uses this port for DNS lookups of control plane API |
| `TCP/443` | - | The Connector will open outbound HTTPS connections over this port for control plane operations. |
| `UDP/4500` | Destination IP `162.159.64.1` | Needed for Connector's initialization and discovery traffic through outbound connections. |
| `UDP/4500` | Destination IP - Cloudflare anycast IPs | Needed for the Cloudflare <GlossaryTooltip term="anycast" link="/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/">anycast IPs</GlossaryTooltip> assigned to your account for tunnel outbound connections. This traffic is tunnel traffic. |
| `TCP/7844`, `UDP/7844` | Outbound connections | This is for debugging facilities in the Connector. |
| `UDP/123` | `http://time.cloudflare.com/` | Needed for Magic WAN Connector to periodically contact Cloudflare's Time Services. |

## Activate Connector

<Render
	file="connector/activate-connector"
	params={{
		shippedLanguage: "The Magic WAN Connector is shipped to you deactivated",
	}}
/>

### WAN with a static IP address

After activating your Connector, you can use it in a network configuration with the WAN interface set to a static IP address — that is, an Internet configuration that is not automatically set by DHCP.

To use your Connector on a network configuration with a static IP:

1. Wait 60 seconds after activating your Connector.
2. Unplug the physical connection to the Internet-connected device which provides DHCP.
3. Adjust your physical connections as required to match the static configuration, and make changes to the [WAN settings](#2-create-a-wan) in the Cloudflare dashboard to reflect the static IP address configuration.
4. Power cycle the Connector.
