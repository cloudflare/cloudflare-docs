title: Bandwidth measurement

---

Cloudflare measures Magic WAN usage based on the 95th percentile of bandwidth utilized by the customer's configured network.

Configured Magic WAN network's bandwidth refers to the sum of traffic routed in and out of Magic WAN network namespace by measuring and summing each active customerâ€™s configured [GRE](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/), [IPSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/), [Cloudflare Tunnel](/magic-wan/zero-trust/cloudflare-tunnel/) and [Cloudflare Network Interconnect](/network-interconnect/) tunnel's highest P95th percentile (ingress or egress traffic). The usage measurement excludes [WARP](/network-interconnect/) traffic.

To measure 95th percentile bandwidth at each tunnel, Cloudflare records bandwidth incoming and leaving our global network at five minute intervals, sorts these measurements in descending order, and discards the top 5% of recorded measurements. The highest remaining value constitutes the 95th percentile bandwidth measurement for that time period.
