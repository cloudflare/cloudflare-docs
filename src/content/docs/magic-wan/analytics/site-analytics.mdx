To start using Magic WAN Site Analytics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. Select **Magic WAN** > **Overview**.

You will have access to an overview map with all your active sites, and any alerts for sites that are unhealthy or have no status available to them.

Review the topics below to learn more about the options available to you.

### All sites

This section shows all the sites you configured with Magic WAN. At a glance, you can check:

- How many active sites you have
- Sites that are healthy or unhealthy
- Sites that have no status available
- Sites that have no location set

#### Site health

Sites can be healthy or unhealthy, and Magic WAN uses this information to route traffic. Refer to [Set thresholds for Magic WAN site health](#set-thresholds-for-magic-wan-site-health) to learn more about this topic.

#### No status available

The status of a site refers to its health. If your sites show a **No status available** message, this means you did not configure your [Tunnel health check alerts](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/configure-magic-tunnel-alerts/).

#### No location available

The dashboard shows you the number of sites with no location set, meaning sites for which you did not set up a geographic location. To add a location to a site, find the site you want to add location to, and select **no location set** to edit its location settings. Refer to [Set geographic coordinates](#set-geographic-coordinates) for more information.


### Traffic overview

Traffic overview aggregates all Magic WAN sites configured in your account. Here, you can check at-a-glance information about each site like:

- Site status
- Traffic sent and received

Select one of your sites to have access to a more detailed view of its traffic, including traffic by tunnel.

## Configure Magic WAN Site Analytics

### Set geographic coordinates

When you create a site, you can set geographic coordinates in order for it to show on the Overview map. You can also add this information to sites you have already created. To add a Magic WAN site to the geographic map in the Overview page:

1. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Sites**.
2. Select a specific site > **Edit**.
3. Scroll to **Site Location**.
4. Set the **latitude** and **longitude** coordinates of the Magic WAN Site.
5. Scroll down and select **Save**.
6. The Magic WAN Site will now appear on the geographic map in the Overview page.

### Set thresholds for Magic WAN site health

You can set Magic Tunnel health alerts to receive alerts when the percentage of successful health checks for a Magic Tunnel drops below the selected service-level objective (SLO). Setting health alerts will also show unhealthy tunnels in the Overview map:

1. Configure [Magic Tunnel health alerts](/magic-wan/configuration/common-settings/configure-magic-tunnel-alerts/) across all of the Magic Tunnels associated with each Magic WAN Site.
2. After configuring Magic Tunnel health alerts, any Magic WAN Site with a Magic Tunnel that is outside of its SLO threshold will be labeled unhealthy in the Overview map.
