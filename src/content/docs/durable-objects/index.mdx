<Description>


Create collaborative applications, real-time chat, multiplayer games and more without needing to coordinate state or manage infrastructure.


</Description>

<Plan type="paid" />

Durable Objects provide a powerful compute API for coordinating multiple clients or users. Each Durable Object has private, transactional and strongly consistent storage attached.

Use Durable Objects to build collaborative editing tools, interactive chat, multiplayer games and applications that need coordination among multiple clients, without requiring you to build serialization and coordination primitives or manage separate storage on your own.

:::note[SQLite in Durable Objects Beta]

New beta version of Durable Objects is available where each Durable Object has a private, embedded SQLite database. When creating a Durabe Object class, users can [opt-in to using SQL storage](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/#enable-sql-storage-on-create-durable-object-class-migration).
