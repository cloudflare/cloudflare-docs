<Description>


Create collaborative applications, real-time chat, multiplayer games and more without needing to coordinate state or manage infrastructure.


</Description>

<Plan type="paid" />

Durable Objects provide a powerful API for coordinating multiple clients or users, each with private, transactional and strongly consistent storage attached.
