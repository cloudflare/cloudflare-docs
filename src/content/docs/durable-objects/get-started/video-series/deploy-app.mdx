We’re almost done with the project, and in this video, we’ll add the finishing touches. Learn how to handle call disconnections, wire up essential media controls like muting/unmuting and video toggling, and integrate a TURN server to ensure reliable connections even behind firewalls. By the end of this video, your app will be fully functional and ready for deployment.
