Durable Objects are a powerful compute API that provides a compute with storage building block. Each Durable Object has its own private, transactional and strongly consistent storage. Durable Objects [Storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#methods) provides access to a Durable Object's attached storage.

A Durable Object's [in-memory state](/durable-objects/reference/in-memory-state/) is preserved as long as the Durable Object is not evicted from memory. Inactive Durable Objects with no incoming request traffic can be evicted. There are normal operations like [code deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/) that trigger Durable Objects to restart and lose their in-memory state. For these reasons, you should use Storage API to persist state durably on disk that needs to survive eviction or restart of Durable Objects.

## Access storage

By default, a Durable Object class leverages a key-value storage backend. New Durable Object classes can opt-in to using a [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sqlite-storage-backend).

[Storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#methods) methods are available on `ctx.storage` parameter passed to the Durable Object constructor. Storage API has key-value APIs and SQL APIs. Only Durable Object classes with a SQLite storage backend can access SQL API.

A common pattern is to initialize a Durable Object from [persistent storage](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) and set instance variables the first time it is accessed. Since future accesses are routed to the same Durable Object, it is then possible to return any initialized values without making further calls to persistent storage.


```ts
export class Counter extends DurableObject {
  value: number;

  constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    super(ctx, env);

    // `blockConcurrencyWhile()` ensures no requests are delivered until
    // initialization completes.
    ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile(async () => {
      // After initialization, future reads do not need to access storage.
      this.value = (await ctx.storage.get("value")) || 0;
    });
  }

  async getCounterValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}
```

## SQLite storage backend

:::note[SQLite in Durable Objects Beta]

The new beta version of Durable Objects is available where each Durable Object has a private, embedded SQLite database. When deploying a new Durable Object class, users can opt-in to a SQLite storage backend in order to access new [SQL API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sqlexec). Otherwise, a Durable Object class has a key-value storage backend.

:::

To allow a new Durable Object class to use SQLite storage backend, use `new_sqlite_classes` on the migration in your Worker's `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_sqlite_classes = ["MyDurableObject"] # Array of new classes
```

[SQL API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sqlexec) is available on `ctx.storage.sql` parameter passed to the Durable Object constructor.
