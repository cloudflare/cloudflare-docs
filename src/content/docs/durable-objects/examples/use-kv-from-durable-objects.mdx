description: Read and write to/from KV within a Durable Object

---

The following Worker script shows you how to configure a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/) to read from and/or write to a [Workers KV namespace](/kv/concepts/how-kv-works/). This is useful when using a Durable Object to coordinate between multiple clients, and allows you to serialize writes to KV and/or broadcast a single read from KV to hundreds or thousands of clients connected to a single Durable Object [using WebSockets](/durable-objects/api/websockets/).

Prerequisites:

* A [KV namespace](/kv/api/) created via the Cloudflare dashboard or the [wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
* A [configured binding](/kv/concepts/kv-bindings/) for the `kv_namespace` in the Cloudflare dashboard or `wrangler.toml` file.
* A [Durable Object namespace binding](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#durable-objects).

Configure your `wrangler.toml` file as follows:

```toml
name = "my-worker"

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE", id = "<id_of_your_namespace>" }
]

[durable_objects]
bindings = [
  { name = "YOUR_DO_CLASS", class_name = "YourDurableObject" }
]
```

```ts
interface Env {
  YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
  YOUR_DO_CLASS: DurableObjectNamespace;
}

export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    // Assume each Durable Object is mapped to a roomId in a query parameter
    // In a production application, this will likely be a roomId defined by your application
    // that you validate (and/or authenticate) first.
    let url = new URL(req.url);
    let roomIdParam = url.searchParams.get("roomId");

    if (roomIdParam) {
      // Create (or get) a Durable Object based on that roomId.
      let durableObjectId = env.YOUR_DO_CLASS.idFromName(roomIdParam);
      // Get a "stub" that allows you to call that Durable Object
      let durableObjectStub = env.YOUR_DO_CLASS.get(durableObjectId);

      // Pass the request to that Durable Object and await the response
      // This invokes the constructor once on your Durable Object class (defined further down)
      // on the first initialization, and the fetch method on each request.
      //
      // You could pass the original Request to the Durable Object's fetch method
      // or a simpler URL with just the roomId.
      let response = await durableObjectStub.fetch(`http://do/${roomId}`);

      // This would return the value you read from KV *within* the Durable Object.
      return response;
    }
  }
}

export class YourDurableObject implements DurableObject {
  constructor(public state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    this.state = state;
    // Ensure you pass your bindings and environmental variables into
    // each Durable Object when it is initialized
    this.env = env;
  }

  async fetch(request: Request) {
    // Error handling elided for brevity.
    // Write to KV
    await this.env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.put("some-key");

    // Fetch from KV
    let val = await this.env.YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE.get("some-other-key");

    return Response.json(val);
  }
}
```
