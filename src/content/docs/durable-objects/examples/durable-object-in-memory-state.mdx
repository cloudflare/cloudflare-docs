This example shows you how Durable Objects are stateful, meaning in-memory state can be retained between requests. After a brief period of inactivity, the Durable Object will be evicted, and all in-memory state will be lost. The next request will reconstruct the object, but instead of showing the city of the previous request, it will display a message indicating that the object has been reinitialized. If you need your applications state to survive eviction, write the state to storage by using the [storage API](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/), or by storing your data elsewhere.

```js
import { DurableObject } from 'cloudflare:workers';

// Worker
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    return await handleRequest(request, env);
  }
}

async function handleRequest(request, env) {
  let id = env.LOCATION.idFromName("A");
  let obj = env.LOCATION.get(id);
  // Forward the request to the remote Durable Object.
  let resp = await obj.fetch(request);
  // Return the response to the client.
  return new Response(await resp.text());
}

// Durable Object
export class Location extends DurableObject {
  constructor(state, env) {
    this.state = state;
    // Upon construction, you do not have a location to provide.
    // This value will be updated as people access the Durable Object.
    // When the Durable Object is evicted from memory, this will be reset.
    this.location = null
  }

  // Handle HTTP requests from clients.
  async fetch(request) {
    let response = null

    if (this.location == null) {
      response = new String(`
This is the first request, you called the constructor, so this.location was null.
You will set this.location to be your city: (${request.cf.city}). Try reloading the page.`);
    } else {
      response = new String(`
The Durable Object was already loaded and running because it recently handled a request.

Previous Location: ${this.location}
New Location: ${request.cf.city}`);
    }

    // You set the new location to be the new city.
    this.location = request.cf.city;
    console.log(response);
    return new Response(response);
  }
}
```

Finally, configure your `wrangler.toml` file to include a Durable Object [binding](/durable-objects/get-started/#5-configure-durable-object-bindings) and [migration](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) based on the namespace and class name chosen previously.

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "durable-object-in-memory-state"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "LOCATION"
class_name = "Location"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["Location"]
```
