:::note


Client IP Geolocation is currently in closed Beta testing.


:::

There are several things you can do to best handle traffic from Cloudflare VPN and forward-proxy users:

* **Origin operators**:
  * Do not block IP addresses associated with our VPN and proxy products (see the [About section](/client-ip-geolocation/about/) for more details)
  * To get even more accurate geolocation data, ensure your origin is [reachable via IPv6](/client-ip-geolocation/faq/)
* **Geolocation data providers**:
  * Regularly pull updated geolocation data from the [Cloudflare API](https://api.cloudflare.com/local-ip-ranges.csv)
* **Users of WARP and 1.1.1.1**:
  * Review the [FAQs](/client-ip-geolocation/faq/#cloudflare-vpn-users) and [About section](/client-ip-geolocation/about/) to learn exactly how, how much, and why we share geolocation data
