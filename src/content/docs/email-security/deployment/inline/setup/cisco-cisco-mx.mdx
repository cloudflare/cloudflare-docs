In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure Email Security with Cisco as MX record. This tutorial is broken down into several steps.

## 1. Add a Sender Group for Email Security Email Protection IPs

To add a new Sender Group:

1. Go to **Mail Policies** > **HAT Overview**.

2. Select the **Add Sender Group** button.

3. Configure the new Sender Group as follows:
   * **Name**: `Area1`.
   * **Order**: Order above the existing **WHITELIST** sender group.
   * **Comment**: `Email Security Email Protection egress IP Addresses`.
   * **Policy**: `TRUSTED` (by default, spam detection is disabled for this mail flow policy).
   * **SBRS**: Leave blank.
   * **DNS Lists**: Leave blank.
   * **Connecting Host DNS Verification**: Leave all options unchecked.

4. Select **Submit and Add Senders**, and add the IP addresses mentioned in [Egress IPs](/email-security/deployment/inline/reference/egress-ips/). If you need to process emails in the EU or India regions for compliance purposes, add those IP addresses as well.

## 2. Add <GlossaryTooltip term="SMTP">SMTP</GlossaryTooltip> route for the Email Security Email Protection Hosts

To add a new SMTP Route:

1. Go to **Network** > **SMTP Routes**.

2. Select **Add Route**.

3. Configure the new SMTP Route as follows:
   * **Receiving Domain**: `a1s.mailstream`
   * In **Destination Hosts**, select **Add Row**, and add the Email Security MX hosts. Refer to the [Geographic locations](#5-geographic-locations) table for more information on what MX hosts to use.

## 3. Create Incoming Content Filters

To manage the mail flow between Email Security and Cisco ESA, you need two filters:

* One to direct all incoming messages to Email Security.
* One to recognize messages coming back from Email Security to route for normal delivery.

### Incoming Content Filter - To Email Security

To create a new Content Filter:

1. Go to **Mail Policies** > **Incoming Content Filters**.

2. Select **Add Filter** to create a new filter.

3. Configure the new Incoming Content Filter as follows:
   * **Name**: `ESA_to_A1S`
   * **Description**: `Redirect messages to Email Security for anti-phishing inspection`
   * **Order**: This will depend on your other filters.
   * **Condition**: No conditions.
   * **Actions**:
     * For **Action** select **Send to Alternate Destination Host**.
     * For **Mail Host** input `a1s.mailstream` (the SMTP route configured in step 2).

### Incoming Content Filter - From Email Security

To create a new Content Filter:

1. Go to **Mail Policies** > **Incoming Content Filters**.

2. Select the **Add Filter** button to create a new filter.

3. Configure the new Incoming Content Filter as follows:
   * **Name**: `A1S_to_ESA`
   * **Description**: `Email Security inspected messages for final delivery`
   * **Order**: This filter must come before the previously created filter.
   * **Conditions**: Add conditions of type **Remote IP/Hostname** with all the IP addresses mentioned in [Egress IPs](/email-security/deployment/inline/reference/egress-ips/). For example:
     Order | Condition            | Rule
     \----- | -------------------- | ---
     `1`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `52.11.209.211`
     `2`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `52.89.255.11`
     `3`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `52.0.67.109`
     `4`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `54.173.50.115`
     `5`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `104.30.32.0/19`
     `6`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `158.51.64.0/26`
     `7`   | `Remote IP/Hostname` | `158.51.65.0/26`
   * Ensure that the *Apply rule:* dropdown is set to **If one or more conditions match**.
   * **Actions**: Select **Add Action**, and add the following:
     Order | Action          | Rule
     \--- | -------------------- | ---
     1   | `Skip Remaining Content Filters (Final Action)` | `skip-filters()`

## 4. Add the Incoming Content Filter to the Inbound Policy table

Assign the Incoming Content Filters created in [step 3](#3-create-incoming-content-filters) to your primary mail policy in the Incoming Mail Policy table. Then, commit your changes to activate the email redirection.

## 5. Geographic locations
