1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome/new). From the dashboard, select **CREATE OR SELECT PROJECT**.
2. Provide the details for the new project, and select **CREATE** to start your new project.
3. Once the new project has been created, the Google Cloud Platform console will automatically redirect you to the Project console. If not, you can use the Project selector to change to the project you created.
4. In **Getting Started**, select **Explore and enable APIs** > Select **ENABLE APIs & SERVICES**.
5. On search bar, search for `Admin SDK API`. Select **Admin SDK API**, then select **ENABLE**.
6. Go back to the sidebar, select **Library**, and search for Gmail API. Select **Gmail API**, then select **ENABLE**.
