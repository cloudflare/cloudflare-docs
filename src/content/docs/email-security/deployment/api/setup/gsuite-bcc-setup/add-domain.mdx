To set up Email Security (formerly Area 1) for Gmail:

1. Log in to the [Email Security (formerly Area 1) dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Select the question mark, where you will be able to find your BCC address.
3. Once you found your address, select **Settings** (the gear icon), then select **New Domain**.
4. Fill in the information needed to add your domain, then select **Publish Domain**.

## Next steps

Now that you have found your BCC address and added your domain, continue with [Add BCC rules](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/gsuite-bcc-setup/bcc-rules-to-area1/) to add BCC rules to Email Security.
