In this tutorial you will learn how to connect your Email Security (formerly Area 1) account to Okta. When single sign-on (SSO) is correctly configured, your authorized employees can connect to the Email Security dashboard using a familiar user name and password.

## 1. Create an Email Security app in Okta

You will need to manually create an app for Email Security in Okta.

1. Log in to Okta as an administrator.

2. In the Admin console, go to **Applications** > **Applications**.

3. Select **Create App Integration** > **SAML 2.0**, and select **Next**.

   ![Choose SAML 2.0 as the new app integration type](~/assets/images/email-security/sso/okta/step3-saml.png)

4. Enter a descriptive name for your app, such as `Email Security`, and select **Next**.

5. Enter the following settings for **SAML Settings**:

   |                                     |                                                                                                                       |

6. Select **Next**.

7. Under **Are you a customer or a partner?**, select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**.

8. In **App type**, select **This is an internal app that we have created**.

9. Select **Finish**.

10. Okta should display the app you have just created. If not, go to **Applications** > **Applications**, and select it.

11. In the **Sign On** tab, go to **View SAML setup instructions** and select it to retrieve the SAML provider information.

    ![Find the View SAML setup instructions button](~/assets/images/email-security/sso/okta/step11-saml-instructions.png)

12. Copy and save the link in **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL**. You will need it later to use in the Email Security dashboard.

    ![Copy and save the SSO URL to use later in the Email Security dashboard](~/assets/images/email-security/sso/okta/step12-sso-url.png)

13. Scroll down to **Optional**. You might need to enlarge the text box to copy and save all the XML data. You will need this information to finish configuration in the Email Security dashboard. The start of the metadata should be similar to the following:

    ```txt
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><EntityDescriptor ID="_<YOUR_DESCRIPTOR_ID>" entityID="https://<YOUR_ENTITY_ID> " xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata">...
    ```

    ![Copy and save the XML metadata to use later in the Email Security dashboard](~/assets/images/email-security/sso/okta/step13-optional.png)

## 2. Configure Email Security to connect to Okta

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).

2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).

3. In **Users and Actions** > **Users and Permissions** add the email addresses of all your authorized administrators.

   ![Fill out your authorized administrators](~/assets/images/email-security/sso/generic/step3-users-actions.png)

4. Go to **SSO Settings** and enable **Single Sign On** switch.

   ![Enable SSO](~/assets/images/email-security/sso/generic/step4-sso.png)

5. In **SSO Enforcement**, choose one of the settings according to your specific needs: <Render file="sso-enforcement" />

6. In **SAML SSO Domain** enter the domain you saved from step 13. For example, `area1security-examplecorp.okta.com`.

7. In **Metadata XML** paste the XML metadata you saved from step 14.

8. Select **Update Settings** to save your configuration.

Log out of any customer portal sessions. Your Okta account should now show a tile for Email Security (formerly Area 1).
