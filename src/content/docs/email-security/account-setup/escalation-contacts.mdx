Whenever Email Security (formerly Area 1) finds an exceptional <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phishing</GlossaryTooltip> threat or Email Service irregularity behavior (compromised email servers at a partner or vendor, wire fraud tactics, and more), we try to reach out to our customers.

There are four types of contacts available to configure, each with a priority type:

* **SOC Contact**: P1 priority.
* **Triage Analyst**: P2 priority.
* **In-Depth Analyst**: P3 priority.
* **Executive Contact**: P4 priority.

Email Security will start by reaching out to P1-level contacts. If they do not respond, we will then try reaching out to the other contacts down the list until we receive a reply from one of these groups.

You can enable these special notifications through an opt-in process:

1. Log in to the [Email Security (formerly Area 1) dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Subscriptions** > **Escalation Contacts**.
4. Select **Add Contact**.
5. Fill out the form.
6. Select **Save**.

:::note


If you select **Critical Service Events**, the contact will be sent a text and/or an email message. They will need to select the link to confirm the subscriptions.
