![Email workflow for retracting emails with Microsoft Office 365](~/assets/images/email-security/email-retraction/o365/opening_img-o365-retraction.png)

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up email retraction for Microsoft Office 365.

## 1. Authorize Email Security with Office 365 for retraction

For message retraction to successfully execute, Email Security needs to be authorized to make API calls into the Office 365 Graph API architecture. The account used to authorize Email Security requires the **Privileged role admin** role.

When assigning user roles in the Office 365 console, you will find these roles in **User permissions** > **Roles configuration** > **Identity admin roles**.

### How does the authorization work?

The authorization process grants Email Security access to the Azure environment with the least applicable privileges required to function. The Enterprise Application that Email Security registers (the Email Security Synchronator) is not tied to any administrator account. Inside of the Azure Active Directory admin center you can review the permissions granted to the application in the Enterprise Application section.

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/), and select **Settings** (the gear icon).

2. Go to **Email Configuration** > **RETRACT SETTINGS**.

1. You need to authorize Email Security to execute retractions through the Graph API of Office 365. Make sure that the account that you will be using to authenticate has the appropriate administrative roles assigned. Select **Authorize** to start the process.

2. The Email Security dashboard will redirect you to a Microsoft login page. Select or enter the appropriate account to initiate the authentication process.

3. Once authenticated, the system will show a dialog box with a list of the requested permissions. Select **Accept** to authorize the change.

4. Upon authorization, you will be automatically redirected to the Email Security dashboard, with a notification that the authorization completed successfully. Select **Dismiss** to clear the notification.

## 2. Configure auto-retraction actions

<Render file="auto-retraction" params={{ one: "Office 365 messages cannot be recovered without using the eDiscovery feature or the Exchange admin center. Refer to [Recover hard deleted messages](#recover-hard-deleted-messages) for more information." }} />

## 3. Configure journaling

<Render file="deployment/journaling-connector" />

## 4. Manual message retraction

<Render file="manual-retraction" />

## Recover hard deleted messages

Office 365 has two ways for recovering hard deleted email messages:

* **[eDiscovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery?view=o365-worldwide)**
* **[Exchange admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/recover-deleted-messages)**

Refer to Microsoft's documentation to learn more about how to use these tools to recover deleted email messages.
