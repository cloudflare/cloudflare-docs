Admin Quarantine allows you to automatically prevent incoming messages from reaching a recipient's inbox based on the <GlossaryTooltip term="disposition" link="/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/">disposition</GlossaryTooltip> assigned by Email Security.

The messages sent to Admin Quarantine are determined by your [domain settings](/email-security/email-configuration/domains-and-routing/domains/).

## Quarantine emails by disposition

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).

2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).

3. Select **Email Configuration** > **Domains**.

4. Select the three dots on the domain that you want to configure admin quarantine for, and choose **Edit**.

5. In **Quarantine Policy** choose the dispositions you want to enable quarantine for that domain.

6. Select **Update Domain**.

:::note[Note]

Quarantine by disposition needs to be configured manually per domain.
