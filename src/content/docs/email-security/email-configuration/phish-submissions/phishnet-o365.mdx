PhishNet is an add-in button that helps users to submit directly to Email Security (formerly Area 1) <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phish</GlossaryTooltip> samples missed by Email Security detection. PhishNet avoids the previous process, where users had to report phish to their email admins, which then had to manually download and forward the sample to Email Security.

## Prerequisites

To set up PhishNet with Office 365, you will need:

* An Email Security account with admin access.
* Admin access to Microsoft.com.

:::note

Only admin users can deploy PhishNet for all users in Office 365. Non-admin users can deploy PhishNet for themselves, but no other users will have access to it.
