Email Security can integrate with Google to retrieve user and group information. This can be used to enforce the Business Email Compromise configuration to prevent user impersonation.

## 1. Create a service account in Google for Email Security Directory Integration

You need to authorize Email Security to make connections into your Google tenant to retrieve your directory details. Cloudflare recommends that you create a service account for this purpose. This account will require the following following privileges:

* View group subscriptions on your domain.
* View organization units on your domain.
* View groups on your domain.
* See info about users on your domain.

Start by creating a service account. If you already have one, you can skip this step.

1. Access your [Google admin console](https://admin.google.com/), and go to **Account** > **Admin roles**.

2. Select **Create new role**, and give it a descriptive name and description. When you are finished, select **Continue**.

3. In **Admin console privileges**, select the following privileges:

   * *Organizational Units > Read*
   * *Users > Read*
   * *Directory Settings > Settings >Google Support Settings*
   * *Directory Sync > Manage Directory Sync Settings > Read Directory Sync Settings*

4. When you specify Admin console privileges, you also grant the corresponding Admin API privileges. In any case, make sure the following privileges are selected for **Admin API privileges**:

   * *Organizational Units > Read*
   * *Users > Read*
   * *Groups > Read*

5. Select **Continue**.

6. Review your information and select **Create Role**.

## 2. Authorize Email Security for Directory Access with Google

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/), and select **Settings** (the gear icon).

2. Go to **Directories**, and select **Add Directory** to start the authorization process.

3. In the Add Directory configuration panel, enter the following details:

   * **Directory Type**: Open the drop-down menu and select **Google**.
   * **Directory Name**: Enter a string that represents the directory. This value will be referenced in the Business Email Compromise List configuration section. For example, `Gmail`.
   * **Sync Frequency**: Update the value to your preference.

   Select **Authorize** when you are done.

4. The Email Security dashboard will redirect you to a Google login page. Select or enter the appropriate account to initiate the authentication process.

5. Once authenticated, the system will show a dialog box with a list of the required permissions. Check all the checkboxes, and select **Continue** to authorize the change.
