Email Security (formerly Area 1) can integrate with Office 365 to retrieve user and group information. This can be used to enforce the Business Email Compromise configuration to prevent user impersonation.

## 1. Authorize Email Security with Office 365 for Directory Access

You need to authorize Email Security to make connections into your [Office 365 tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/tenant-management-overview) to retrieve your directory details. The account used to authorize will require the **Privileged authentication admin** and **Privileged role admin** roles.

### How does the authorization work?

The authorization process grants Email Security access to the Azure environment with the least applicable privileges required to function. The Enterprise Application that Email Security registers is not tied to any administrator account. Inside of the Azure Active Directory admin center you can review the permissions granted to the application in the Enterprise Application section.

When assigning user roles in the Office 365 console, you will find these roles in **User permissions** > **Roles configuration** > **Identity admin roles**.

2. Go to **Directories**, and select **Add Directory** to start the authorization process.

3. In the Add Directory configuration panel, enter the following details:

   * **Directory Type**: Open the drop-down menu and select **Office 365**.
   * **Directory Name**: Enter a string that represents the directory. This value will be referenced in the Business Email Compromise List configuration section. For example, `Office 365`.
   * **Sync Frequency**: Update the value to your preference.

   Select **Authorize** when you are done.
