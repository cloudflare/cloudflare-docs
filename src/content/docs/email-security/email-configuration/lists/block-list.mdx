When you add **blocked senders**, Email Security automatically marks all messages from these senders with a `MALICIOUS` <GlossaryTooltip term="disposition" link="/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/">disposition</GlossaryTooltip>.

## Add a blocked sender

To create a new blocked pattern:

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).

2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).

3. On **Email Configuration**, go to **Block List** > **Blocked Senders**.

4. Select **+ New Sender**.

5. Enter the pattern information:

   * **Sender**: Enter one of the following types of pattern:

     * **Email addresses**: Must be a valid email.
     * **IP addresses**: Can only be IPv4. IPv6 and CIDR are invalid entries.
     * **Regular expressions**: Must be [valid Java expressions](https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html). Regular expressions are matched with fields related to the sender email address (`envelope from`, `header from`, `reply-to`), the originating IP address, and the server name for the email.

   * **Notes**: Provide additional notes about the blocked sender pattern.

6. Select **Save**.

### CSV uploads

You can also upload a CSV file of multiple allowed patterns. The CSV file must be smaller than 150 KB, start with a header row of all required values, and contain no additional fields.

An example file would look like this:

```txt
Blocked_Sender, Notes
john.smith@email.com, John Smith
melanie.turner@email.com, Melanie Turner
```
