When Email Security detects a <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phishing</GlossaryTooltip> email, the metadata of the detection can be sent directly to KnowBe4. For this tutorial, you will need a working KnowBe4 account with the SecurityCoach add-on. You will also need to create an organization key to use in Email Security. This organization key will let you integrate KnowBe4 with Email Security. Refer to [KnowBe4 documentation](https://support.knowbe4.com/hc/articles/13129840202643) for more information on this subject.

After creating your organization key and authorizing Email Security:

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Email Configuration** > **Domains & Routing** > **Alert Webhooks**.
4. Select **New Webhook**.
5. In **App Type**, select **SIEM**.
6. Choose *KnowBe4* from the dropdown, and paste your organization key into the **Auth Code** section.
7. In **Target**, paste the URL that suits your organization. KnowBe4 has different URLs for different regions:
   | KnowBe4 instance | URL                                            |
