<sup>beta</sup> This limit is beta only and is expected to increase over time.

<sup>1</sup> 1 KB is measured as 1000 bytes. Messages can include up to \~100 bytes of internal metadata that counts towards total message limits.

<sup>2</sup> The maximum message throughput per queue will continue to increase during the beta period.

<sup>3</sup> Exceeding the maximum message throughput will cause the `send()` and `sendBatch()` methods to throw an exception with a `Too Many Requests` error until your producer falls below the limit.

<sup>4</sup> Messages in a queue that reach the maximum message retention are deleted from the queue. Queues does not delete messages in the same queue that have not reached this limit.

<sup>5</sup> Individual queues that reach this limit will receive a `Storage Limit Exceeded` error when calling `send()` or `sendBatch()` on the queue.

<sup>6</sup> Refer to [Workers limits](/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time).
