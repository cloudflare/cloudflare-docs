    content: Cloudflare Queues - Configuration
---

Cloudflare Queues can be configured using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the command-line interface for Cloudflare's Developer Platform, which includes [Workers](/workers/), [R2](/r2/), and other developer products.

Each Worker has a [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file that specifies environment variables, triggers, and resources, such as a Queue. To enable Worker-to-resource communication, you must set up a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your Worker project's [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file.

Use the options below to configure your queue.

:::note

Below are options for Queues, refer to the Wrangler documentation for a full reference of [[Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

## Producer

A producer is a [Cloudflare Worker](/workers/) that writes to one or more queues. A producer can accept messages over HTTP, asynchronously write messages when handling requests, and/or write to a queue from within a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/). Any Worker can write to a queue.

To produce to a queue, set up a binding in your [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file. These options should be used when a Worker wants to send messages to a queue.

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[queues.producers]]
  queue = "my-queue"
  binding = "MY_QUEUE"
```

</WranglerConfig>

- <code>queue</code> string

  - The name of the Queue.

- <code>binding</code> string

  - The name of the binding, which is a JavaScript variable.

## Consumer

## Workers

To consume messages from one or more queues, set up a binding in your [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration) file. These options should be used when a Worker wants to receive messages from a queue.

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
[[queues.consumers]]
  queue = "my-queue"
  max_batch_size = 10
  max_batch_timeout = 30
  max_retries = 10
  dead_letter_queue = "my-queue-dlq"
```

</WranglerConfig>

Refer to [Limits](/queues/platform/limits) to review the maximum values for each of these options.

- <code>queue</code> string

  - The name of the Queue.

- <code>max\_batch\_size</code> number optional

  - The maximum number of messages allowed in each batch.
  - Defaults to `10` messages.

- <code>max\_batch\_timeout</code> number optional

  - The maximum number of seconds to wait until a batch is full.
  - Defaults to `5` seconds.

- <code>max\_retries</code> number optional

  - The maximum number of retries for a message, if it fails or [`retryAll()`](/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#messagebatch) is invoked.
  - Defaults to `3` retries.

- <code>dead\_letter\_queue</code> string optional

  - The name of another Queue to send a message if it fails processing at least `max_retries` times.
  - If a `dead_letter_queue` is not defined, messages that repeatedly fail processing will eventually be discarded.
  - If there is no Queue with the specified name, it will be created automatically.

- <code>max\_concurrency</code> number optional

  - The maximum number of concurrent consumers allowed to run at once. Leaving this unset will mean that the number of invocations will scale to the [currently supported maximum](/queues/platform/limits/).
  - Refer to [Consumer concurrency](/queues/configuration/consumer-concurrency/) for more information on how consumers autoscale, particularly when messages are retried.

## Pull-based

A queue can have a HTTP-based consumer that pulls from the queue. This consumer can be any HTTP-speaking service that can communicate over the Internet. Review [Pull consumers](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) to learn how to configure a pull-based consumer.
