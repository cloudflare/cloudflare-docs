Device Information Only mode allows you to enforce device posture rules when a user connects to your [self-hosted Access application](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/). This mode relies on a client certificate generated from your account to establish trust between the Access application and the device.

To set up Device Information Only mode:

1. Enable client certificate provisioning for [your zone](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/):

   ```bash
   curl --request PATCH \
   "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/devices/policy/certificates" \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data '{"enabled": true}'
   ```

2. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.

3. In the **Profile settings** card, choose a [device profile](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) and select **Configure**.

4. For **Service mode**, select **Device Information Only**.

5. Next, [enroll your device](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) into your Zero Trust organization.

   When enrolled in Device Information Only mode, the WARP client will automatically generate a client certificate and install the certificate on the device. This certificate is necessary to confirm the source of outgoing traffic.

6. (Optional) Verify the client certificate on the device:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Windows">

1. Open the Start menu and select **Run**.
2. Enter `certlm.msc`.
3. Go to **Personal** > **Certificates**.

The certificate name should match the **Device ID** in your WARP client **Preferences**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="macOS">

1. Open **Keychain Access**.
2. Go to **System** > **My Certificates**.

The certificate name should match the **Device ID** in your WARP client **Preferences**.

7. (Optional) Verify the client certificate in your Cloudflare account:

   1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select the zone for which you enabled client certificates.
   2. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Client Certificates**.

   The certificate name is the WARP enrollment **Device ID**.

8. Lastly, block traffic from devices that do not have a valid client certificate:
   1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **SSL/TLS** > **Client Certificates**.
   2. Under **Hosts**, add the domain you want to protect with device posture rules.
   3. Select **Create mTLS rule**.
   4. Change the **URI path** field to **Hostname**, and enter the domain you want to protect.
   5. Select **Deploy**. This creates a WAF custom rule that checks all requests to your domain for a valid client certificate.

Device Information Only mode is now enabled on the device. To start enforcing device posture, set up a [WARP client check](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/) and add a *Require* device posture rule to your [Access policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/). When the device connects to the Access application for the first time, the browser will ask to use the client certificate installed by WARP.
