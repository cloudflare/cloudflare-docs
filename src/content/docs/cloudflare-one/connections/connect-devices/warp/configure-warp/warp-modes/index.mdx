You can deploy the WARP client in different modes to control the types of traffic sent to Cloudflare Gateway. The WARP mode determines which Zero Trust features are available on the device.

## Gateway with WARP (default)

This mode is best suited for organizations that want to use advanced firewall/proxy functionalities and enforce device posture rules.

| DNS filtering | HTTP filtering | Features enabled                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes           | Yes            | DNS policies, HTTP policies, Browser Isolation, identity-based policies, device posture checks, AV scanning, and Data Loss Prevention |

## Gateway with DoH

This mode is best suited for organizations that only want to apply DNS filtering to outbound traffic from their company devices. Network and HTTP traffic is handled by the default mechanisms on your devices.

| DNS filtering | HTTP filtering | Features enabled |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Yes           | No             | DNS policies     |

## Secure Web Gateway without DNS filtering

This mode is best suited for organizations that want to proxy network and HTTP traffic but keep their existing DNS filtering software. DNS traffic is handled by the default mechanism on your device.

| DNS filtering | HTTP filtering | Features enabled                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No            | Yes            | HTTP policies, Browser Isolation, identity-based policies, device posture checks, AV scanning, and Data Loss Prevention |

:::note


* This mode disables all features that rely on WARP for DNS resolution, including [domain-based split tunneling](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#domain-based-split-tunnels) and [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/).
* Only available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Proxy mode

This mode is best suited for organizations that want to filter traffic directed to specific applications.

| DNS filtering | HTTP filtering | Features enabled                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No            | Yes            | HTTP policies, Browser Isolation, identity-based policies, AV scanning, and Data Loss Prevention for traffic sent through localhost proxy |

:::note


* Proxy mode can only be used by applications/operating systems that support SOCKS5/HTTPS proxy communication.
* Only available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Device Information Only

This mode is best suited for organizations that only want to enforce [WARP client device posture checks](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/) for zones in your account. DNS, Network and HTTP traffic is handled by the default mechanisms on your devices. To setup Device Information Only mode, refer to the [dedicated page](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/device-information-only/).

| DNS filtering | HTTP filtering | Features enabled                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No            | No             | Device posture rules in [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) |
