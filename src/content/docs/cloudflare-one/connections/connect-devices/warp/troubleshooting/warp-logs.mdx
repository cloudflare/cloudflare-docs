The WARP client provides diagnostic logs that you can use to troubleshoot connectivity issues on a device.

## macOS/Windows/Linux

### Retrieve logs

To view WARP logs on desktop devices:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="macOS">

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Run the `warp-diag` tool:
   ```sh
   warp-diag
   ```

This will place a `warp-debugging-info-<date>-<time>.zip` on your Desktop.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Windows">

1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
2. Run the `warp-diag` tool:
   ```bash
   C:\Users\JohnDoe>warp-diag
   ```

This will place a `warp-debugging-info-<date>-<time>.zip` on your Desktop.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Linux">

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Run the `warp-diag` tool:
   ```sh
   warp-diag
   ```

This will place a `warp-debugging-info-<date>-<time>.zip` in the same folder you ran the command from.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::note
You can also use Digital Experience Monitoring to run `warp-diag` commands on remote devices. For more information, refer to [Remote captures](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/).

#### Multiple versions of the same log

The `warp-debugging-info` folder may contain multiple versions of the same log, such as `daemon.log`, `daemon.1.log`, and `daemon.2.log`. Since logs can get very long, they are rotated either daily or when they exceed a certain size.

- `<logfile>.log` is the most current log. This is almost always the log you should be looking at, as it shows events that occurred on the day you ran the `warp-diag` command.
- `<logfile>.1.log` shows events from the previous day.
- `<logfile>.2.log` shows events from two days before.

:::note

In timestamped logs such as `daemon.log`, the most recent events will appear at the end of the file.
