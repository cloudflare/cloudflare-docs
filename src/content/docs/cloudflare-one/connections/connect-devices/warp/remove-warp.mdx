The following procedures will uninstall the WARP client from your device. If you used the WARP client to deploy a root certificate, the certificate will also be removed.

## Windows

1. Go to Windows Settings (Windows Key + I).
2. Select **Apps**.
3. Select **App & Features**.
4. Scroll to find the Cloudflare WARP application and select **Uninstall**.

## macOS

We include an uninstall script as part of the macOS package that you originally used.

1. To find and run the uninstall script, run the following commands:

```sh
cd /Applications/Cloudflare\ WARP.app/Contents/Resources
./uninstall.sh
```

2. If prompted, enter your admin credentials to proceed with the uninstall.

:::note

You can bypass the **Are you sure** prompt by passing `-f` as a parameter to the macOS uninstall command.
