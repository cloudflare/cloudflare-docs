If you plan to direct your users to manually download and configure the WARP client, users will need to connect the client to your organization's Cloudflare Zero Trust instance.

## Prerequisites

- [Set device enrollment permissions](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/) to specify which users can connect.

## Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Enroll via the GUI

<Render file="warp/enroll-desktop" />

The device is now protected by your organization's Zero Trust policies.

### Enroll via the CLI

To enroll your device using the terminal:

1. [Download](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/) and install the WARP package.

2. Open a terminal window. Ensure that you are logged into the terminal as the current user and not as root.

3. Enroll into Cloudflare Zero Trust using your organization's <GlossaryTooltip term="team name">team name</GlossaryTooltip>:

   ```sh
   warp-cli registration new <your-team-name>
   ```

4. In the browser window that opens, complete the authentication steps required by your organization.

   Once authenticated, you will see a success page and a dialog prompting you to open a link.

5. Select **Open Link**.

6. Verify the registration in the terminal:

   ```sh
   warp-cli registration show
   ```

<Details header="Troubleshoot missing registration">

The registration process may take a few minutes to complete. If the registration continues to be missing, then manually copy the authentication token from the browser to the WARP client:

1. On the success page, right-click and select **View Page Source**.
2. Find the HTML metadata tag that contains the token. For example, `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content"=0;url=com.cloudflare.warp://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/auth?token=yeooilknmasdlfnlnsadfojDSFJndf_kjnasdf..." />`
3. Copy the URL field: `com.cloudflare.warp://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/auth?token=<your-token>`
4. In the terminal, run the following command using the URL obtained in the previous step.

   ```sh
   warp-cli registration token "com.cloudflare.warp://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/auth?token=<your-token>"
   ```

If you get a `401` error, then the token has expired. Generate a new one by refreshing the web page and quickly grab the new token from the page source.

</Details>

7. If you did not configure WARP to [auto-connect](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#auto-connect), manually turn on WARP:

   ```sh
   warp-cli connect
   ```

The device is now protected by your organization's Zero Trust policies. For more information on all available commands, run `warp-cli --help`.

## iOS, Android, and ChromeOS

<Render file="warp/enroll-ios-android" />

The device is now protected by your organization's Zero Trust policies.

## Virtual machines

By default, virtual machines (VMs) are subject to the WARP client settings of the host. If you want to deploy a separate instance of WARP in a VM, you must configure the VM to operate in bridged networking mode.
