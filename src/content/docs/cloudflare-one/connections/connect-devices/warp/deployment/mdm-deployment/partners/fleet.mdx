This guide covers how to deploy the Cloudflare WARP client using [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/) device management software.

## macOS

### 1. Create a custom MDM file

1. [Download](/cloudflare-one/static/mdm/CloudflareWARP.mobileconfig) an example `.mobileconfig` file.
2. Modify the file with your desired [deployment parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/).

### 2. Upload MDM file to Fleet

1. In the Fleet admin console, go to **Controls**.
2. From the **Teams** dropdown, select the team (group of hosts) that requires Cloudflare WARP.
3. Select **OS settings** > **Custom settings**.
4. Select **Add profile** and upload the custom `.mobileconfig`.
5. Select the hosts which require Cloudflare WARP:
		- **All hosts**: Deploys WARP to all hosts in the team.
		- **Custom**: Deploys WARP to a subset of the hosts in the team. Use [labels](https://fleetdm.com/guides/managing-labels-in-fleet#basic-article) to define the hosts that should be included or excluded.
6. Select **Add profile**.

The defined hosts will immediately receive the deployment profile, but WARP is not yet installed.

3. Select **Add Software** and upload the `.pkg` file that was previously downloaded.

### 5. Install WARP with Fleet

try {

$installProcess = Start-Process msiexec.exe `
  -ArgumentList "/quiet /norestart ORGANIZATION=your-team-name SUPPORT_URL=https://example.com /lv ${logFile} /i `"${env:INSTALLER_PATH}`"" `
  -PassThru -Verb RunAs -Wait

Get-Content $logFile -Tail 500

Exit $installProcess.ExitCode

} catch {
  Write-Host "Error: $_"
  Exit 1
}
```

Refer to [deployment parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/) for a description of each argument.

## Linux

Fleet allows you to [execute custom scripts](https://fleetdm.com/guides/scripts) on Linux hosts. Your script should:

2. Run the [WARP installation commands](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/)  for your specific Linux platform.
