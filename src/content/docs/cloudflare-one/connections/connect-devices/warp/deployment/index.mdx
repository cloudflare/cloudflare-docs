    content: Deploy WARP to your organization

---

Depending on how your organization is structured, you can deploy WARP in one of two ways:

* [Manual deployment](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) — If you are a small organization, asking your users to download the client themselves and type in the required settings is the ideal way to get started with WARP.

* [Managed deployment](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/) — Bigger organizations with MDM tools like Intune or JAMF can deploy WARP to their entire fleet of devices from a single operation.
