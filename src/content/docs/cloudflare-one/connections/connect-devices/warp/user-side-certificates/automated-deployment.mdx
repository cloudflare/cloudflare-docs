</Details>

The WARP client can automatically install a Cloudflare certificate or [custom root certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/) on Windows, macOS, and Debian/Ubuntu Linux devices. On mobile devices and Red Hat-based systems, you will need to [install the certificate manually](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/).

The certificate is required if you want to [apply HTTP policies to encrypted websites](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/), display custom block pages, and more.

## Install a certificate using WARP

1. (Optional) [Upload](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/) a custom root certificate to Cloudflare.
2. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
3. Turn on [**Install CA to system certificate store**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#install-ca-to-system-certificate-store).
4. [Install](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/) the WARP client on the device.
5. [Enroll the device](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) in your Zero Trust organization.
6. (Optional) If the device is running macOS Ventura or newer, [manually trust the certificate](#manually-trust-the-certificate).

WARP will install the [certificate set to **In-Use**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/#certificate-status). This certificate can be either a [Cloudflare-generated certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/#generate-a-cloudflare-root-certificate) or a [custom certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/). If you turn on a new certificate for inspection, WARP will automatically install the new certificate and remove the old certificate from your users' devices.

:::note[Important]
WARP only installs the system certificate -- it does not install the certificate to individual applications. You will need to [manually add the certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/#add-the-certificate-to-applications) to applications that rely on their own certificate store.
:::

## Access the installed certificate

After installing the certificate using WARP, you can verify successful installation by accessing the device's system certificate store.

### macOS

To access the installed certificate in macOS:

1. Open Keychain Access.
2. In **System Keychains**, go to **System** > **Certificates**.
3. Open your certificate. The default Cloudflare certificate name is **Gateway CA - Cloudflare Managed G1**.
4. If the certificate is trusted by all users, Keychain Access will display **This certificate is marked as trusted for all users**.

The WARP client will also place the certificate in `/Library/Application Support/Cloudflare/installed_cert.pem` for reference by scripts or tools.

#### Manually trust the certificate

macOS Ventura and newer do not allow WARP to automatically trust the certificate. To manually trust the certificate:

1. In Keychain Access, [find and open the certificate](#macos).
2. Open **Trust**.
3. Set **When using this certificate** to _Always Trust_.
4. (Optional) Restart the device to reset connections to Zero Trust.

Alternatively, you can configure your mobile device management (MDM) to automatically trust the certificate on all of your organization's devices.

### Windows

To access the installed certificate in Windows:

1. Open the Start menu and select **Run**.
2. Enter `certlm.msc`.
3. Go to **Trusted Root Certification Authority** > **Certificates**. The default Cloudflare certificate name is **Gateway CA - Cloudflare Managed G1**.

The WARP client will also place the certificate in `%ProgramData%\Cloudflare\installed_cert.pem` for reference by scripts or tools.

### Linux

On Linux, the certificate is stored in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates`. The default Cloudflare certificate name is `managed-warp.pem`.

If you cannot find the certificate, run the following commands to update the system store:

1. Go to the system certificate store.

   ```sh
   cd /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
   ```

2. Rename the certificate, changing the file extension to `.crt`.

   ```sh
   sudo mv managed-warp.pem managed-warp.crt
   ```

3. Update your list of custom CA certificates.

   ```sh
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

The WARP client will also place the certificate in `/var/lib/cloudflare-warp/installed_cert.pem` for reference by scripts or tools.

## Uninstall the certificate

If the certificate was installed by the WARP client, it is automatically removed when you turn on another certificate for inspection in Zero Trust, turn off **Install CA to system certificate store**, or [uninstall WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/remove-warp/). WARP does not remove certificates that were installed manually (for example, certificates added to third-party applications).

To manually remove the certificate, refer to the instructions supplied by your operating system or the third-party application.
