import { Details, Render, TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components";

:::note

This procedure is only required to enable specific Cloudflare Zero Trust features, and should only be done at the direction of your IT department. This procedure is not required to enable the WARP client for consumers.

:::

If your device does not support [certificate installation via WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/automated-deployment/), you can manually install a Cloudflare certificate. You must add the certificate to both the [system keychain](#add-the-certificate-to-operating-systems) and to [individual application stores](#add-the-certificate-to-applications). These steps must be performed on each new device that is to be subject to HTTP filtering.

## Download the Cloudflare root certificate

:::note[Download limitation]
You can only download certificates from the Zero Trust dashboard.
:::

First, [generate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/#generate-a-cloudflare-root-certificate) and download a Cloudflare certificate. The certificate is available in both `.pem` and `.crt` file format. Certain applications require the certificate to be in a specific file type, so ensure you download the most appropriate file for your use case.

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Resources**.
2. In **Certificates**, select **Manage**.
3. Select the certificate you want to download.
4. Depending on which format you want, choose **Download .pem** and/or **Download .crt**.

### Verify the downloaded certificate

To verify your download, use a terminal to check that the downloaded certificate's hash matches the thumbprint listed under **Certificate thumbprint**. For example:

#### SHA1

```sh title="SHA1 .crt example"
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform der -in <Cloudflare_CA.crt>
```

```sh output
SHA1 Fingerprint=BB:2D:B6:3D:6B:DE:DA:06:4E:CA:CB:40:F6:F2:61:40:B7:10:F0:6C
```

```sh title="SHA1 .pem example"
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in <Cloudflare_CA.pem>
```

```sh output
SHA1 Fingerprint=BB:2D:B6:3D:6B:DE:DA:06:4E:CA:CB:40:F6:F2:61:40:B7:10:F0:6C
```

#### SHA256

```sh title="SHA256 .crt example"
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform der -in <Cloudflare_CA.crt>
```

```sh output
sha256 Fingerprint=F5:E1:56:C4:89:78:77:AD:79:3A:1E:83:FA:77:83:F1:9C:B0:C6:1B:58:2C:2F:50:11:B3:37:72:7C:62:3D:EF
```

```sh title="SHA256 .pem example"
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in <Cloudflare_CA.pem>
```

```sh output
sha256 Fingerprint=F5:E1:56:C4:89:78:77:AD:79:3A:1E:83:FA:77:83:F1:9C:B0:C6:1B:58:2C:2F:50:11:B3:37:72:7C:62:3D:EF
```

## Add the certificate to operating systems

### macOS

In macOS, you can choose the keychain in which you want to install the certificate. Each keychain impacts which users will be affected by trusting the root certificate.

| Keychain    | Access scope                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| login       | The logged in user                           |
| Local Items | Users with access to cached iCloud passwords |
| System      | All users on the system                      |

To install a Cloudflare certificate in macOS, you can use either the Keychain Access application or a terminal. Both methods require you to [download a certificate](#download-the-cloudflare-root-certificate) in `.crt` format.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Keychain Access">

1. Download a Cloudflare certificate.
2. Open the `.crt` file in Keychain Access. If prompted, enter your local password.
3. In **Keychain**, choose the access option that suits your needs and select **Add**.
4. In the list of certificates, locate the newly installed certificate. Keychain Access will mark this certificate as not trusted. Right-click the certificate and select **Get Info**.
5. Select **Trust**. Under **When using this certificate**, select _Always Trust_.

The root certificate is now installed and ready to be used.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Terminal">

1. Download a Cloudflare certificate.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Add the certificate to your keychain:

```sh
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <path-to-Cloudflare_CA.crt>
```

This keychain will allow all users on the system access to the certificate. If you want to install the certificate to a different keychain, replace `System.keychain` with the name of that keychain.

4. Update the OpenSSL CA Store to include the Cloudflare certificate:

```sh
echo | sudo tee -a /etc/ssl/cert.pem < Cloudflare_CA.pem
```

The root certificate is now installed and ready to be used.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note[Change certificate access scope]
If you want to change user access to the Cloudflare certificate, you can open Keychain Access and move the certificate to a different keychain on the left sidebar.
:::

### Windows

After adding the Cloudflare certificate to ChromeOS, you may also have to [install the certificate in your browser](#browsers).

## Add the certificate to applications

Some packages, development tools, and other applications provide options to trust root certificates that will allow for the traffic inspection features of Gateway to work without breaking the application.

All of the applications below first require downloading a Cloudflare certificate with the instructions above. On macOS, the default path to the system keychain database file is `/Library/Keychains/System.keychain`. On Windows, the default path is `\Cert:\CurrentUser\Root`.

:::note
Some applications require the use of a publicly trusted certificate — they do not trust the system certificate, nor do they have a configurable private store. For these applications to function, you must add a [Do Not Inspect policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) for the domains or IPs that the application relies on.
:::

### Browsers

   ```

2. Identify the CA store:

   ```sh
   python -m certifi
   ```

   ```sh output
   ~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/certifi/cert.pem
   ```

3. [Download a Cloudflare certificate](#download-the-cloudflare-root-certificate) in `.pem` format.

4. Append the Cloudflare certificate to this CA store by running:

   ```sh
   echo | cat - Cloudflare_CA.pem >> $(python -m certifi)
   ```

5. If needed, configure system variables to point to this CA store:

   ```sh
   export CERT_PATH=$(python -m certifi)
   export SSL_CERT_FILE=${CERT_PATH}
   export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=${CERT_PATH}
   ```

### Git

#### Git on Windows
