Advanced security features such as [HTTPS traffic inspection](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/), [Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/), [anti-virus scanning](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/antivirus-scanning/), [Access for Infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/), and [Browser Isolation](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/) require users to install and trust a root certificate on their device. You can either install the certificate provided by Cloudflare (default option), or generate your own custom certificate and upload it to Cloudflare.

Gateway [generates a unique root CA](#generate-a-cloudflare-root-certificate) for each Zero Trust account and deploys its across the Cloudflare global network. Alternatively, Enterprise users can upload and deploy their own [custom certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/).

Once you deploy your certificate across Cloudflare and turn it on, you can install it on your user's devices either [with WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/install-cert-with-warp/) or [manually](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/install-cloudflare-cert/).

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inactive          | The certificate has been uploaded to Cloudflare but is not deployed across the global network. |
| Pending           | The certificate is being activated or deactivated for use.                                     |
| Active            | The certificate is deployed across the Cloudflare global network and ready to be turned on.    |
| Active and In-Use | The certificate is turned on. Gateway will use the certificate for inspection.                 |

## Generate a Cloudflare root certificate

:::note[Certificate generation limitation]
Each Zero Trust account can generate a new root certificate a maximum of three times per day.
:::

To generate a new Cloudflare root certificate for your Zero Trust organization:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Resources**.
2. In **Certificates**, select **Manage**.
3. Select **Generate certificate**.
4. Choose a duration of time before the certificate expires. Cloudflare recommends expiration after five years. Alternatively, choose _Custom_ and enter a custom amount in days.
5. Select **Generate certificate**.

The certificate will appear in your list of certificates as **Inactive**. To deploy your certificate and turn it on for inspection, you need to [activate the certificate](#activate-a-root-certificate).

## Activate a root certificate

:::note
Zero Trust accounts using the Cloudflare certificate prior to September 2024 will need to redeploy and activate the newly generated certificate. Zero Trust accounts created during or after September 2024 will use an active certificate by default.
:::

Once a certificate is generated in or uploaded to Zero Trust, you need to activate it. Activating a certificate deploys it across the Cloudflare network.

To activate your root certificate:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Resources**.
2. In **Certificates**, select **Manage**.
3. Select the certificate you want to activate.
4. Select **Activate**.

The status of the certificate will change to **Pending** while it deploys. Once the status of your certificate is **Active**, you can turn the certificate on for use in inspection:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Resources**.
2. In **Certificates**, select **Manage**.
3. Select the certificate you want to turn on.
4. In **Basic information**, select **Confirm and turn on certificate**.

Only one certificate can be turned on for inspection at a time. Setting a certificate as **In-Use** will set any other turned on certificates as **Active** and prevent them from being used for inspection until turned on again.
