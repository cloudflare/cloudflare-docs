With Cloudflare Zero Trust, you can connect private networks and the services running in those networks to Cloudflare's global network. This involves installing a [connector](#connectors) on the private network, and then [setting up routes](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#3-connect-a-network) which define the IP addresses available in that environment. Unlike [public hostname routes](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/routing-to-tunnel/), private network routes can expose both HTTP and non-HTTP resources.

To reach private network IPs, end users must connect their device to Cloudflare and enroll in your Zero Trust organization. The most common method is to install the [WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/) on their device, or you can onboard their network traffic to Cloudflare using our [WARP Connector](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/warp-connector/) or [Magic WAN](/magic-wan/zero-trust/cloudflare-tunnel/).

Administrators can optionally set [Gateway network policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/) to control access to services based on user identity and device posture.

## Connectors

Here are the different ways you can connect your private network to Cloudflare:

- [**cloudflared**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/) installs on a server in your private network to create a secure, outbound tunnel to Cloudflare. Cloudflare Tunnel using `cloudflared` only proxies traffic initiated from a user to a server. Any service or application running behind the tunnel will use the server's default routing table for server-initiated connectivity.
- [**WARP-to-WARP**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/warp-to-warp/) uses the [Cloudflare WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/) to establish peer-to-peer connectivity between two or more devices. Each device running WARP can access services on any other device running WARP via an assigned virtual IP address.
- [**WARP Connector**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/warp-connector/) installs on a Linux server in your private network to establish site-to-site, bidirectional, and mesh networking connectivity. The WARP Connector acts as a subnet router to relay client-initiated and server-initiated traffic between all devices on a private network and Cloudflare.
- [**Magic WAN**](/magic-wan/) relies on configuring legacy networking equipment to establish anycast GRE or IPsec tunnels between an entire network location and Cloudflare.
