When setting up WARP Connector on a virtual private cloud (VPC), you may need to configure additional settings in the cloud service provider.

## GCP

For Google Cloud Project (GCP) deployments, [enable IP forwarding](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-routes#canipforward) on the VM instance where you installed WARP Connector.

## AWS

For Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments:
- Stop [source/destination checking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) on the EC2 instance where you installed WARP Connector.
- In your [subnet route table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-route-tables.html), route all IPv4 traffic to the EC2 instance where you installed WARP Connector. For example,

		| Destination | Target |
		| ----------- | ------ |
		| `0.0.0.0/0` | `eni-11223344556677889` |
