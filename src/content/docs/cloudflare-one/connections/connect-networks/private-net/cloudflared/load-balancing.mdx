You can use Cloudflare Local Traffic Management (LTM) to distribute traffic across private endpoints connected via Cloudflare Tunnel. Common use cases include:

* Load balancing internal employee traffic to internal applications
* Geosteering WARP traffic to internal applications
* Load balancing internal API calls

To set up load balancing for private IP addresses, refer to the [LTM documentation](/load-balancing/local-traffic-management/ltm-tunnels-setup/).
