Follow this step-by-step guide to get your first tunnel up and running using Zero Trust.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

* [Add a website to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).
* [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).

## 1. Create a tunnel

<Render file="tunnel/create-tunnel" product="cloudflare-one" />

The next steps depend on whether you want to [connect an application](#2-connect-an-application) or [connect a network](#3-connect-a-network).

## 2. Connect an application

Follow these steps to connect an application through your tunnel. If you are looking to connect a network, skip to the [Connect a network section](#3-connect-a-network).

<Render file="tunnel/add-public-hostname" product="cloudflare-one" />

## 3. Connect a network

Follow these steps to connect a private network through your tunnel.

1. In the **Private Networks** tab, add an IP or CIDR.

2. Select **Save tunnel**.

## 4. View your tunnel

After saving the tunnel, you will be redirected to the **Tunnels** page. Look for your new tunnel to be listed along with its active connector.
