This example walks through how to set up an SSH server on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine (VM), but you can use any machine that supports SSH connections.

### 1. Create an SSH key pair

Before creating your VM instance you will need to create an SSH key pair.

1. Open a terminal and type the following command:

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/gcp_ssh -C <username in GCP>
   ```

2. Enter your passphrase when prompted. It will need to be entered twice.

   Two files will be generated: `gcp_ssh` which contains the private key, and `gcp_ssh.pub` which contains the public key.

3. In the command line, enter:

   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/gcp_ssh.pub
   ```

4. Copy the output. This will be used when creating the VM instance in GCP.

:::note

You can configure SSH servers that do not require SSH keys and instead rely exclusively on Cloudflare Zero Trust policies or [short-lived certificates](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/) to secure the server.

### 2. Create a VM instance in GCP

Now that the SSH key pair has been created, you can create a VM instance.

1. In your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project).
2. Go to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
3. Select **Create instance**.
4. Name your VM instance, for example `ssh-server`.
5. Scroll down to **Advanced options** > **Security** > **Manage Access**.
6. Under **Add manually generated SSH keys**, select **Add item** and paste the public key that you have created.
7. Select **Create**.
8. Once your VM instance is running, open the dropdown next to **SSH** and select _Open in browser window_.

:::note

In order to be able to establish an SSH connection, do not enable [OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin) on the VM instance.

### 3. Connect the server to Cloudflare

<Render file="tunnel/warp-to-tunnel-server" />

### 4. Set up the client

<Render file="tunnel/warp-to-tunnel-client" />

### 5. Route private network IPs through WARP

<Render file="tunnel/warp-to-tunnel-route-ips" />

### 6. Connect as a user

Once you have set up the application and the user device, the user can now SSH into the machine using its private IP address. If your SSH server requires an SSH key, the key should be included in the command.

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/gcp_ssh <username>@<server IP>
```
