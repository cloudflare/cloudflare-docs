[Access for Infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/) uses the same deployment model as [WARP-to-Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/ssh-warp-to-tunnel/) but unlocks more granular policy options and command logging functionality.
<Render file="access/short-lived-certs-intro" params={{ intro: "Furthermore, Access for Infrastructure replaces" }} />

## 1. Connect the server to Cloudflare

1. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel for your server by following our [dashboard setup guide](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/). You can skip the connect an application step and go straight to connecting a network.

2. In the **Private Networks** tab for the tunnel, enter the private IP address of your server (or a range that includes the server IP).

## 2. Set up the client

<Render file="tunnel/warp-to-tunnel-client" />

## 3. Route private network IPs through WARP

<Render file="tunnel/warp-to-tunnel-route-ips" />

## 4. Add a target

<Render file="access/add-target" />

## 5. Add an infrastructure application

<Render file="access/add-infrastructure-app" />

## 6. Add a policy

<Render file="access/add-infrastructure-policy" />

## 7. Configure SSH server

Next, configure your SSH server to trust the Cloudflare SSH CA. This allows Access to authenticate using short-lived certificates instead of traditional SSH keys.

### Generate a Cloudflare SSH CA
<Render file="ssh/ssh-proxy-ca" />

### Save the public key
<Render file="ssh/public-key" />

### Modify your SSHD config
<Render file="ssh/modify-sshd" />

### Restart your SSH server
<Render file="ssh/restart-server" />

## 8. Connect as a user

Users can use any SSH client to connect to the target, as long as they are logged into the WARP client on their device. Users do not need to modify any SSH configs on their device. For example, to SSH from a terminal:

```sh
ssh <username>@<target IP>
```

For more information, refer to the [Access for Infrastructure documentation](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/#connect-as-a-user).

## SSH command logs

SSH command logs contain the actual SSH commands that a user ran on the target. These logs are encrypted using a public key provided by the customer and are not visible to Cloudflare.

### Enable SSH command logging

<Render file="ssh/upload-ssh-key" params={{ note: "" }} />

### Disable SSH command logging

To turn off SSH command logging, delete your uploaded public key using the API:

```sh

```

### View SSH logs

SSH command logs are not visible from the dashboard itself and must be exported and decrypted.

To manually retrieve logs:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Logs** > **Access**.
2. Select a user who was allowed to access the target.
3. Select **Download** to download the session's command log.
4. <Render file="ssh/decrypt-ssh-log" />

Enterprise customers can also export command logs using [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/).
