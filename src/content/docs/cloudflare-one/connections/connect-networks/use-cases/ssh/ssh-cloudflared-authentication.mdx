:::note
Not recommended for new deployments. Cloudflare recommends using [Access for Infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/) for private network access and [Browser-rendered terminal](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/ssh-browser-rendering/) for clientless SSH.
:::

End users can connect to an SSH server without the WARP client by authenticating through `cloudflared` in their native terminal. This method requires having `cloudflared` installed on both the server machine and on the client machine, as well as an active zone on Cloudflare. The traffic is proxied over this connection, and the user logs in to the server with their Cloudflare Access credentials.

The public hostname method can be implemented in conjunction with routing over WARP so that there are multiple ways to connect to the server. You can reuse the same tunnel for both the private network and public hostname routes.

## 1. Connect the server to Cloudflare

<Render file="ssh/tunnel-public-hostname" />

## 2. Connect as a user

1. [Install `cloudflared`](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) on the client machine.

2. Make a one-time change to your SSH configuration file:

   ```sh
   vim ~/.ssh/config
   ```

3. Input the following values; replacing `ssh.example.com` with the hostname you created.

   ```txt
   Host ssh.example.com
   ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h
   ```

   The `cloudflared` path may be different depending on your OS and package manager. For example, if you installed `cloudflared` on macOS with Homebrew, the path is `/opt/homebrew/bin/cloudflared`.

4. You can now test the connection by running a command to reach the service:

   ```sh
   ssh <username>@ssh.example.com
   ```

   When the command is run, `cloudflared` will launch a browser window to prompt you to authenticate with your identity provider before establishing the connection from your terminal.
