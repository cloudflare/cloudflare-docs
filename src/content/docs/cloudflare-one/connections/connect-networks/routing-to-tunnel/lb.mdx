## Add a tunnel to a load balancer pool

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a load balancer, refer to the [Load Balancing documentation](/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/). The endpoint address is the subdomain of your tunnel, `<UUID>.cfargotunnel.com`.

If you want to add a [monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/) to your load balancer pool, you will need to add a host header to **Advanced health check settings**. The header will be similar to `Header Name: Host` and `Value: www.your-zone.com`. The monitor will not work without the host header if you are using a config file that defines the `ingress` field, as shown in [this example](https://github.com/cloudflare/argo-tunnel-examples/blob/adb44da43ec0aa65f7928613b762a47ae0d9b2b0/named-tunnel-k8s/cloudflared.yaml#L90).

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="cli">

You can add Cloudflare Tunnel to an existing load balancer pool directly from `cloudflared`:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel route lb <tunnel name/uuid> <hostname> <load balancer pool>
```

- `<hostname>`: the DNS hostname of the load balancer, for example `lb.example.com`.

- `<load balancer pool>`: the name of the [pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool) that will contain the tunnel subdomain.

This command creates an LB DNS record that points the specified hostname to the subdomain of your tunnel (`<UUID>.cfargotunnel.com`). Traffic will not be proxied unless the tunnel is running.

:::note

To create DNS records using `cloudflared`, the [`cert.pem`](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/tunnel-useful-terms/#certpem) file must be installed on your system.

## Optional Cloudflare settings

The application will default to the Cloudflare settings for the load balancer hostname, including [cache rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) and [firewall policies](/firewall/). You can change the settings for your hostname in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

## Known limitations

### Monitors and TCP Tunnel origins

If you have a tunnel to a port or SSH port, do not run a TCP health check.

Instead, set up a health check endpoint in `cloudflared` — for example, an [ingress entry rule](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/local-management/configuration-file/#file-structure-for-public-hostnames) that returns a fixed HTTP status response — and create an **HTTP** [monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/) for that endpoint. The monitor will only verify that your server is reachable. It does not check whether the server is running and accepting requests.

### Session affinity and replicas

The load balancer does not distinguish between [replicas](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/deploy-cloudflared-replicas/) of the same tunnel. If you run the same tunnel UUID on two separate hosts, the load balancer treats both hosts as a single endpoint. To maintain [session affinity](/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/) between a client and a particular host, you will need to connect each host to Cloudflare using a different tunnel UUID.

### Local connection preference

If you notice traffic imbalances across endpoints in different locations, you may have to adjust your load balancer setup.

`cloudflared` connections give preference to tunnels that terminate in the same Cloudflare data center. This behavior can impact how connections are weighted and traffic is distributed.

The solution depends on the type of tunnel being used. If running [legacy tunnels](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/migrate-legacy-tunnels/), put your origins in different pools. If running [Cloudflare tunnel replicas](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/deploy-cloudflared-replicas/) (using a shared ID), switch to separate Cloudflare tunnels as distinct origins.
