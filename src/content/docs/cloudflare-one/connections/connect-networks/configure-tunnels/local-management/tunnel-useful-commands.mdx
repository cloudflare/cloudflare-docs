| `cloudflared tunnel route ip add <IP/CIDR> <NAME or UUID>`                             | Adds any network route space (represented as a CIDR) to your routing table. That network space becomes reachable for requests egressing from a user's machine as long as it is using Cloudflare WARP and is enrolled in the same account that is running the tunnel chosen here. Further, those requests will be proxied to the specified tunnel, and reach an IP in the given CIDR, as long as that IP is reachable from the tunnel. To assign the IP route to a specific [Virtual Network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/), use the `--vnet` option. |
| `cloudflared tunnel route ip show` (or `list`)                                         | Shows your organization's private routing table.

This is useful if you get an error trying to delete or run a tunnel after `cloudflared` is not shut down gracefully (for example, if a `kill` command is issued).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `cloudflared tunnel cleanup --connector-id <CONNECTOR-ID> <NAME or UUID>`              | Disconnects and deletes a [cloudflared replica](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/deploy-cloudflared-replicas/) with the given connector ID. You can view all replicas for a tunnel by running `cloudflared tunnel info <NAME or UUID>`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `cloudflared tunnel delete <NAME or UUID>`                                             | Deletes tunnels with the given name or UUID. A tunnel cannot be deleted if it has active connections. To delete the tunnel unconditionally, use the `-f` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `cloudflared tunnel vnet add <NAME or UUID>`                                           | Creates a Virtual Network to which IP routes can be assigned. To make this Virtual Network the default for your Zero Trust organization, use the `-d` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `cloudflared tunnel vnet delete <NAME or UUID>`                                        | Deletes the Virtual Network with the given name or UUID. Before you can delete a Virtual Network, you must first delete all IP routes assigned to the Virtual Network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `cloudflared update`  | Looks for a new version on the official download server. If a new version exists, it updates the agent binary and quits. Otherwise, no action is performed. This command only works if `cloudflared` was installed from GitHub binaries or from source. For more information, refer to the [update instructions](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/update-cloudflared/). |
| `cloudflared version` | Prints the `cloudflared` version number and build date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
