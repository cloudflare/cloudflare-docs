This guide covers how to connect an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual machine to Cloudflare using our lightweight connector, `cloudflared`.

We will deploy:

- An EC2 virtual machine that runs a basic HTTP server.
- A Cloudflare Tunnel that allows users to connect to the service via either a public hostname or a private IP address.

### Prerequisites

To complete the following procedure, you will need to:

- [Add a website to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/)
- [Deploy the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) on an end-user device

## 1. Create a VM instance in AWS

1. From the AWS console, go to **Compute** > **EC2** > **Instances**

2. Select **Launch instance**.

3. Name your VM instance. In this example we will name it `http-test-server`.

4. For \*_Amazon Machine Image (AMI)_ choose your desired operating system and specifications. For this example, we will use _Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type_.

5. For **Instance type:**, you can select _t2.micro_ which is available on the free tier.

6. In **Key pair (login)**, create a new key pair to use for SSH. You will need to download the `.pem` file onto your local machine.

7. In **Network settings**, select **Create security group**.

8. Turn on the following Security Group rules:

   - **Allow SSH traffic from _My IP_** to prevent the instance from being publicly accessible.
   - **Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet**
   - **Allow HTTP traffic from the internet**

9. Select **Launch instance**.

10. Once the instance is up and running, go to the **Instances** summary page and copy its **Public IPv4 DNS** hostname (for example, `ec2-44-202-59-16.compute-1.amazonaws.com`).

11. To log in to the instance over SSH, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
cd Downloads
```

```
chmod 400 "YourKeyPair.pem"
```

```sh
ssh -i "YourKeyPair.pem" ubuntu@ec2-44-202-59-16.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

12. Run `sudo su` to gain full admin rights to the instance.

13. For testing purposes, you can deploy a basic Apache web server on port `80`:

```bash
$ apt update

$ apt -y install apache2

$ cat <<EOF > /var/www/html/index.html
<html><body><h1>Hello Cloudflare!</h1>
<p>This page was created for a Cloudflare demo.</p>
</body></html>
EOF
```

14. To verify that the Apache server is running, open a browser and go to `http://ec2-44-202-59-16.compute-1.amazonaws.com` (make sure to connect over `http`, not `https`). You should see the **Hello Cloudflare!** test page.

## 2. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel

<Render
	file="tunnel/cloud-create-tunnel"
	params={{ one: "AWS instance", two: "aws" }}
/>

## 3. Connect using a public hostname

<Render file="tunnel/cloud-public-hostname" />

## 4. Connect using a private IP

[Private network routes](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/) allow users to connect to your virtual private cloud (VPC) using the WARP client. To add a private network route for your Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. In the **Private Network** tab, enter the **Private IPv4 address** of your AWS instance (for example, `172.31.19.0`). You can expand the IP range later if necessary.
2. In your [Split Tunnel configuration](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#add-a-route), make sure the private IP is routing through WARP. For example, if you are using Split Tunnels in Exclude mode, delete `172.16.0.0/12`. We recommend re-adding the IPs that are not explicitly used by your AWS instance -- you can use [this calculator](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/03/wireguard-allowedips-calculator/) to determine which IP addresses to re-add.
3. To test on a user device:

   1. [Log in to the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/).
   2. Open a terminal window and connect to the service using its private IP:

   ```sh
   $ curl 172.31.19.0
   <html><body><h1>Hello Cloudflare!</h1>
   <p>This page was created for a Cloudflare demo.</p>
   </body></html>
   ```

You can optionally [create Gateway network policies](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/#4-recommended-filter-network-traffic-with-gateway) to control who can access the instance via its private IP.

## Firewall configuration

To secure your AWS instance, you can configure your [Security Group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-group-rules.html) to deny all inbound traffic and allow only outbound traffic to the [Cloudflare Tunnel IP addresses](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/#required-for-tunnel-operation). All Security Group rules are Allow rules; traffic that does not match a rule is blocked. Therefore, you can delete all inbound rules and leave only the relevant outbound rules.

:::note

If you delete the inbound rule for port `22`, you will be unable to SSH back into the instance.
:::

After configuring your Security Group rules, verify that you can still access the service through Cloudflare Tunnel via its [public hostname](#3-connect-using-a-public-hostname) or [private IP](#4-connect-using-a-private-ip). The service should no longer be accessible from outside Cloudflare Tunnel -- for example, if you go to `http://ec2-44-202-59-16.compute-1.amazonaws.com` the test page should no longer load.
