This guide covers how to connect a Google Cloud Project (GCP) virtual machine to Cloudflare using our lightweight connector, `cloudflared`.

We will deploy:

- A Google Cloud Project (GCP) virtual machine that runs a basic HTTP server.
- A Cloudflare Tunnel that allows users to connect to the service via either a public hostname or a private IP address.

### Prerequisites

To complete the following procedure, you will need to:

- [Add a website to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/)
- [Deploy the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) on an end-user device

## 1. Create a VM instance in GCP

1. In your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project).

2. Go to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.

3. Select **Create instance**.

4. Name your VM instance. In this example we will name it `http-test-server`.

5. Choose your desired operating system and specifications. For this example, you can use the following settings:

   - **Machine family:** General Purpose
   - **Series:** E2
   - **Machine type:** e2-micro
   - **Boot disk image:** Debian GNU/Linux 12
   - **Firewalls**: Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic

6. Under **Advanced options** > **Management** > **Automation**, add the following startup script. This example deploys a basic Apache web server on port `80`.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   apt update
   apt -y install apache2
   cat <<EOF > /var/www/html/index.html
   <html><body><h1>Hello Cloudflare!</h1>
   <p>This page was created for a Cloudflare demo.</p>
   </body></html>
   EOF
   ```

7. Select **Create**.

8. The operating system automatically starts the Apache HTTP server. To verify that the server is running:

   1. Copy the **External IP** for the VM instance.
   2. Open a browser and go to `http://<EXTERNAL IP>`. You should see the **Hello Cloudflare!** test page.

9. To login to the VM instance, open the dropdown next to **SSH** and select _Open in browser window_.

## 2. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel

<Render
	file="tunnel/cloud-create-tunnel"
	params={{ one: "GCP VM", two: "gcp" }}
/>

## 3. Connect using a public hostname

<Render file="tunnel/cloud-public-hostname" />

## 4. Connect using a private IP

To configure a private network route for your Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. In the **Private Network** tab, enter the **Internal IP** of your GCP VM instance (for example, `10.0.0.2`). You can expand the IP range later if necessary.
2. In your [Split Tunnel configuration](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#add-a-route), make sure the internal IP is routing through WARP. For example, if you are using Split Tunnels in Exclude mode, delete `10.0.0.0/8`. We recommend re-adding the IPs that are not explicitly used by your GCP VM -- you can use [this calculator](https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/03/wireguard-allowedips-calculator/) to determine which IP addresses to re-add.
3. To test on a user device:

   1. [Log in to the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/).
   2. Open a terminal window and connect to the service using its private IP:

   ```sh
   curl 10.0.0.2
   ```

   ```sh output
   <html><body><h1>Hello Cloudflare!</h1>
   <p>This page was created for a Cloudflare demo.</p>
   </body></html>
   ```

You can optionally [create Gateway network policies](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/#4-recommended-filter-network-traffic-with-gateway) to control who can access the VM via its private IP.

## Firewall configuration

To secure your VM instance, you can [configure your VPC firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/using-firewalls) to deny all ingress traffic and allow only egress traffic to the [Cloudflare Tunnel IP addresses](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/#required-for-tunnel-operation). Since GCP denies ingress traffic by [default](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/firewalls#default_firewall_rules), you can delete all ingress rules and leave only the relevant egress rules.

:::note

If you delete the default `allow-ssh` rule, you will be unable to SSH back into the VM.
:::

After configuring your VPC firewall rules, verify that you can still access the service through Cloudflare Tunnel via its [public hostname](#3-connect-using-a-public-hostname) or [private IP](#4-connect-using-a-private-ip). The service should no longer be accessible from outside Cloudflare Tunnel -- for example, if you go to `http://<EXTERNAL IP>` the test page should no longer load.
