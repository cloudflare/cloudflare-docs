For customers using Microsoft Exchange, setting up Email Security via BCC is quick and easy. You need to configure an inbound rule to send emails to Email Security via BCC for processing and detection of potential <GlossaryTooltip term="phishing">phishing</GlossaryTooltip> attacks. The following email flow shows how this works:

## Configure Inbound Rule

1. Access Exchange's **Management Console**, and go to **Organization Configuration** > **Hub Transport**.

3. Give the transport rule a name and a description and select **Next**.

11. At the main configuration page of the transport rule, select **Next** to continue to the Exception configuration panel.

12. You do not need to configure an exception rule. Select **Next**.

    ![Select the new button](~/assets/images/email-security/deployment/api-setup/exchange/step13.png)

:::note

If you have multiple rules, you may need to change the order of the BCC rule and move it to the right location in your rule sequence. This is needed so you can send BCC messages to Email Security. Usually, the Email Security BCC rule will be at the top of the ruleset. The configured conditions of the Email Security BCC rule will only trigger for inbound messages.

## Email processing and reports

In BCC mode, all emails are put through automated phishing detections by Email Security. Emails that trigger phishing detections are logged for reporting via product portal, email and Slack. Emails that do not trigger any detections are deleted.
