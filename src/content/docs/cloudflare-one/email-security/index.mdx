Secure your email inbox with API-first Email Security.
</Description>

Email Security secures your email inbox with API-first email security. Email Security integrates with your existing email provider and blocks phishing attacks, malware, [Business Email Compromise](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) attacks, and vendor email fraud.

Email Security allows you to:

- Configure [allow policies](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/allow-policies/), [blocked senders](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/blocked-senders/), [trusted domains](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/trusted-domains/), and [additional detections](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/additional-detections/).
- [Automatically move messages](/cloudflare-one/email-security/auto-moves/) to specific folders based on a [certain disposition](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).
- [Manage directories](/cloudflare-one/email-security/directories/).
- [Monitor your inbox](/cloudflare-one/insights/email-monitoring/) and perform a thorough [search of your email](/cloudflare-one/insights/email-monitoring/search-email/).
- Generate a [Phishing Risk Assessment report](/cloudflare-one/insights/email-monitoring/phishing-report/) and [submit email phishing reports](/cloudflare-one/insights/email-monitoring/phish-submissions/).
