   - **Registered**: To view registered users.
   - **Unregistered**: To view unregistered users.

To filter users:

Select the **Users** dropdown, and choose one of the following:
   - **All**: To view users in groups and not in groups.
   - **Users in groups**: To view users in groups.
   - **Users not in groups**: To view users not in groups.
