Outbound Data Loss Prevention ensures the protection of sensitive information in outbound emails with [Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/). Outbound Data Loss Prevention integrates with your inbox, and it proactively monitors your email to prevent unauthorized data leaks.

## Get started

To begin using outbound DLP, install the Cloudflare add-in in Microsoft 365:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.
2. In **Protect sensitive data in outbound emails**, select **Get started**.
3. Select **Download add-in** to download the Cloudflare add-in.
4. Configure Microsoft 365 to use the Cloudflare add-in:
   1. In the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com/), go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Settings** > **Integrated Apps**.
   2. Select **Upload custom apps**. For the application type, choose _Office Add-in_.
   3. Select **Upload manifest file (.xml) from device**.
   4. Upload the Cloudflare add-in file.
   5. Verify and complete the wizard.
5. Confirm the Cloudflare add-in was configured in Microsoft 365.

After configuring the Cloudflare add-in in Microsoft 365, you can select **Add a policy** to create an [outbound DLP policy](#create-an-outbound-policy).

## Create an outbound policy

An outbound policy allows you to control outbound email flow.

To create an outbound DLP policy:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. Name your policy.
4. Build an expression to match specific email traffic. For example, you can create a policy that blocks outbound emails containing identifying numbers:

   | Selector            | Operator | Value                                                     | Logic | Action |
   | ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ |
   | Recipient email     | not in   | `example.com`                                             | And   | Block  |
   | Matched DLP profile | in       | _Social Security, Insurance, Tax, and Identifier Numbers_ |       |        |

5. (Optional) Choose whether to use the default block message or a custom message.
6. Select **Create policy**.

After creating your policy, you can modify or reorder your policies in **Email Security** > **Outbound DLP**.
