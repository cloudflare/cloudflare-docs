The impersonation registry contains combinations of emails of users who are likely to be impersonated. If there is an email that is on the impersonation registry not listed as an alternative email address, that email will be reported as potential [business email compromise (BEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/).

:::note

The impersonation registry should contain a list of users who are likely to be impersonated. Email Security applies enhanced security to variations of registered email addresses for additional [Business Email Compromise (BEC)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/business-email-compromise-bec/) protection.

For easier tracking, the Email Security team recommends syncing and structuring VIPs in groups, and avoid doing manual inputs of users.
