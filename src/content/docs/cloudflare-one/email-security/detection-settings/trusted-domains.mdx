Email Security allows you to exempt known partner and internal domains from typical detection scanning. Adding trusted domains helps to reduce false positives on [malicious, suspicious, and spoof dispositions](/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

To configure a trusted domain:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email Security**.
3. Select **Settings**, go to **Detection settings** > **Trusted domains**.
4. On the **Detection settings** page, select **Add a domain**.
5. Select the **Input method**: Choose between **Manual input**, and **Upload trusted domain list**:
   - **Manual input**:
     - **Domain info**: Enter a valid domain name.
     - **Domain type**: Select one or both options:
       * **Proximity domain**: Domains with similar spelling to your existing domain.
       * **Recent domain**: Domains created recently.
     * **Notes**: Provide additional information about the trusted domain list.
   - **Upload trusted domain list**: You can upload a file no larger than 150 KB of multiple trusted domains. The file can only contain `Domain`, `Notes`, `Proximity` and `Recent` fields. The first row must be a header row. 
6. Select **Save**.
