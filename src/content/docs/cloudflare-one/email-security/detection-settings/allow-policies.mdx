Email Security allows you to configure allow policies. An allow policy exempts messages that match certain patterns from normal detection scanning.

To configure allow policies:

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email Security**.
3. Select **Settings**, then go to **Detection settings** > **Allow policies**.
4. On the **Detection settings** page, select **+ Add a policy**.
5. On the **Add an allow policy** page, enter the policy information:
   - **Input method**: Choose between **Manual input**, and **Uploading an allow policy**:
       - **Manual input**:
           - **Action**: Select one of the following to choose how Email Security will handle messages that match your criteria:
               - **Trust sender**: Messages will bypass all detections and link following.
               - **Exempt recipient**: Message to this recipient will bypass all detections.
               - **Accept sender**: Messages from this sender will be exempted from Spam, Spoof, and Bulk dispositions.
       - **Rule type**: Specify the scope of your policy. Choose one of the following:
           - **Email addresses**: Must be a valid email.
           - **IP addresses**: Can only be IPv4. IPv6 and CIDR are invalid entries.
           - **Domains**: Must be a valid domain.
           - **Regular expressions**: Must be valid Java expressions. Regular expressions are matched with fields related to the sender email address (envelope from, header from, reply-to), the originating IP address, and the server name for the email.
     - **(Recommended) Sender verification**: This option enforces DMARC, SPF, or DKIM authentication. If you choose to enable this option, Email Security will only honor policies that pass authentication.
       - **Notes**: Provide additional information about your allow policy.
   - **Uploading an allow policy**: Upload a file no larger than 150 KB. The file can only contain `Pattern`, `Notes`, `Verify Email`, `Trusted Sender`, `Exempt Recipient` and `Acceptable Sender` fields. The first row must be a header row. 
6. Select **Save**.
