Cloudflare Access allows your users to use LinkedIn as their identity provider (IdP).

## Set up LinkedIn as an IdP

To configure LinkedIn as an IdP:

1. Go to [the LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers).

2. Select **Create App**.

3. Sign in to your LinkedIn account. The **Create an app** screen displays.

4. Enter an **App name** for your application.

5. Enter the URL for your business page.

6. Select **Upload a logo** and go to your company logo image file.

7. Select **OK**.

8. (optional) Select the **Share on LinkedIn** option to announce that your clients can use LinkedIn to access your app.

9. Select the **Sign In with LinkedIn** option.

10. Select the **API Terms of Use** link to read the terms of use.

11. If you agree to the terms, check the **I have read and agree to these terms** option.

12. Select **Create app**.

13. Go to your account Settings page.

14. Select the **Auth** tab.

15. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

19. In the **App ID** and **Client secret** fields, input the **Client ID** and **Client secret** values you've copied from the Application credentials tab in the LinkedIn Developer Portal.

20. Select **Save**.

21. In the **LinkedIn** **Auth** tab, scroll to **OAuth 2.0 settings** and select the pencil icon to edit the settings.

22. Enter the following URL:

    ```txt
    https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
    ```

    You can find your team name in Zero Trust under **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

To test that your connection is working, in Zero Trust, go to **Authentication** > **Login methods** and select **Test** next to LinkedIn.
