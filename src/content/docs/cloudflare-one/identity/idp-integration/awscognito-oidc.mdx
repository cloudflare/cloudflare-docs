Amazon Cognito provides SSO identity management for end users of web and mobile apps. You can integrate Amazon Cognito as an OIDC identity provider for Cloudflare Zero Trust.

## Prerequisites

- An Amazon Cognito [user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/tutorial-create-user-pool.html)

## Set up Amazon Cognito (OIDC)

### 1. Obtain Amazon Cognito settings

The following Amazon Cognito values are required to set up the integration:

- App (client) ID
- Client secret
- Auth URL
- Token URL
- Certificate (key) URL

To retrieve those values:

1. Log in to your Amazon Cognito admin portal.

2. Go to **User pools** and select your user pool.

3. Select the **App integration** tab.

4. Under **Domain**, copy your user pool domain or [configure a new domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-assign-domain.html).

5. Make note of the following [Amazon Cognito OIDC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/federation-endpoints.html):

   - **Auth URL**: `https://<your user pool domain>/oauth2/authorize`
   - **Token URL**: `https://<your user pool domain>/oauth2/token`
   - **Certificate (key) URL**: `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<your user pool ID>/.well-known/jwks.json` (This is the **Token signing key URL** shown in **User pool overview**.)

6. Under **App client list**, select **Create app client**.

7. For **App type**, select **Confidential client**.

8. Enter an **App client name** for your application.

9. Ensure that **Generate a client secret** is selected.

10. Configure the following **Hosted UI settings**:

    1. In **Allowed callback URLs**, add the following URL:

       ```txt
       https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
       ```

       You can find your team name in Zero Trust under **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

    2. Select **Identity providers** to use with this app client. At minimum, enable **Cognito user pool** as a provider.

    3. For **OAuth 2.0 grant types**, select **Authorization code grant**.

    4. For **OpenID Connect scopes**, select **OpenID**, **Email**, and **Profile**.

11. Select **Create app client**.

12. Next, select the app client you just created.

13. Copy its **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

### 2. Add Amazon Cognito as an identity provider

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.

2. Under **Login methods**, select **Add new**.

3. Select **OpenID Connect**.

4. Name your identity provider and fill in the required fields with the information obtained from Amazon Cognito.

5. (Optional) Enable [Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/) if the protocol is supported by your IdP. PKCE will be performed on all login attempts.

6. (Optional) Under **Optional configurations**, enter [custom OIDC claims](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/generic-oidc/#oidc-claims) that you wish to add to users' identity. This information will be available in the [user identity endpoint](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/application-token/#user-identity).

7. Select **Save**.

To [test](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/#test-idps-in-zero-trust) that your connection is working, select **Test**.
