The Client Certificate device posture attribute checks if the device has a valid certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). The posture check can be used in Gateway and Access policies to ensure that the user is connecting from a managed device.

<sup>1</sup> Client certificate checks that ran on an earlier WARP version will continue to work. To configure a new certificate check, update WARP to the versions listed above.
</Details>

## Prerequisites

- A CA that issues client certificates for your devices. WARP does not evaluate the certificate trust chain; this needs to be the issuing certificate.
- Cloudflare WARP client is [deployed](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/) on the device.
- A client certificate is [installed and trusted](#how-warp-checks-for-a-client-certificate) on the device.

:::note

You can use the [Cloudflare PKI toolkit](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-mtls-using-cloudflare-pki) to generate a sample root CA for testing.
:::

## Configure the client certificate check

1. <Render
   	file="upload-mtls-cert"
   	params={{
   		one: "The private key is only required if you are using this custom certificate for Gateway HTTPS inspection.",
   	}}
   />

2. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.

3. Scroll down to **WARP client checks** and select **Add new**.

4. Select **Client certificate**.

5. You will be prompted for the following information:

   1. **Name**: Enter a unique name for this device posture check.
   2. **Operating system**: Select your operating system.
   3. **OS locations**: Specify the location(s) where the client certificate is installed.
      <Details header="Windows">
      	- Local machine trust store - User trust store
      </Details>
      <Details header="macOS">- System keychain</Details>
      <Details header="Linux">
      	- NSSDB (`/etc/pki/nssdb`) - To search a custom location, enter the
      	absolute file path(s) to the certificate and private key (for example
      	`/usr/local/mycompany/certs/client.pem` and
      	`/usr/local/mycompany/certs/client_key.pem`). The certificate and
      	private key must be in `PEM` format. They can either be in two different
      	files or the same file.
      </Details>
   4. **Certificate ID**: Enter the UUID of the root CA.
   5. **Common name**: (Optional) To check for a specific common name on the client certificate, enter a string with optional `${serial_number}` and `${hostname}` variables (for example, `${serial_number}_mycompany`). WARP will search for an exact, case-insensitive match. If you do not specify a common name, WARP will ignore the common name field on the certificate.
   6. **Check for Extended Key Usage**: (Optional) Check whether the client certificate has one or more attributes set. Supported values are **Client authentication** (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2`) and/or **Email** (`1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4`).
   7. **Check for private key**: (Recommended) When enabled, WARP checks that the device has a private key associated with the client certificate.

6. Select **Save**.

Next, go to **Logs** > **Posture** and verify that the client certificate check is returning the expected results.

## Troubleshooting

You can use the following commands to check if a client certificate is properly installed and trusted on the device.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Windows">

1. Open a PowerShell window.
2. To search the local machine trust store for a certificate with a specific common name, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My\ | where{$_.Subject -like "*<COMMON_NAME>*"}
```

3. To search the user trust store for a certificate with a specific common name, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My\ | where{$_.Subject -like "*<COMMON_NAME>*"}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

1. Open Terminal.
2. To search System Keychain for a certificate with a specific common name, run the following command:

```sh
/usr/bin/security find-certificate -c "<COMMON_NAME>" -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Linux">

1. Open Terminal.
2. To list all client certificates in NSSDB, run the following command:

```sh
certutil -L -d /etc/pki/nssdb
```

```sh output
Certificate Nickname                                         Trust Attributes
                                                             SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

meow                                                         CTu,Cu,Cu
noPrivateKey                                                 CT,,

```

3. Open your desired certificate using its certificate nickname. The common name will appear in the line `Subject: "CN=123456.mycompany"`.

```sh
certutil -L -d /etc/pki/nssdb -n meow
```

```sh output

For the posture check to pass, a certificate must appear in the output that validates against the uploaded root CA.
