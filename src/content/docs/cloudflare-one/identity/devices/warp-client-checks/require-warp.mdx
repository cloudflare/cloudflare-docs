This device posture attribute will check for all versions of WARP, including the consumer version.

Cloudflare Zero Trust enables you to restrict access to your applications to devices running the Cloudflare WARP client. This allows you to flexibly ensure that a user's traffic is secure and encrypted before allowing access to a resource protected behind Cloudflare Zero Trust.

## Prerequisites

* <Render file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed" params={{ name: "WARP Client Checks", link: "/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/" }} />

## 1. Enable the WARP check

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. Ensure that **Proxy** is enabled.
3. Next, go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
4. Scroll down to **WARP client checks** and select **Add new**.
5. Select **WARP**.

You are now ready to start requiring WARP for your Access applications.

## 2. Add the check to an Access policy

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.

2. Locate the application for which you want to require WARP.

3. Select **Edit**.

4. To have an existing policy require WARP, select **Edit** for that specific policy. Then, add an **Include** or **Require** rule which uses the *WARP* selector.

5. Select **Save rule**.

Before granting access to the application, your policy will now check that the device is running the WARP client.
