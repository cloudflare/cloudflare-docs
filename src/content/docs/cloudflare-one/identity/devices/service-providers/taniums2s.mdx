import { Render } from "~/components"

<Render file="posture/service-provider-intro" params={{ one: "Tanium" }} />

## Prerequisites

* Either Tanium Cloud or on-premise installations of Tanium
* Tanium agent is deployed on the device.
* <Render file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed" params={{ name: "Service providers", link: "/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/service-providers/" }} />

## Set up Tanium as a service provider

### 1. Get Tanium settings

The following Tanium values are needed to set up the Tanium posture check:

* Client Secret
* Rest API URL

To retrieve those values:

1. Log in to your Tanium instance.
2. Go to **Administration** > **API Tokens**.
3. Select **New API Token**.
4. Set **Expire in days** to an appropriate value for your organization. When this token expires, all device posture results will begin to fail unless updated.
5. Set **Trusted IP addresses** to `0.0.0.0/0`.
6. Select **Save**.
7. Copy the **Client Secret** and **API URL** to a safe place.

### 2. Add Tanium as a service provider

<Render file="posture/add-service-provider" params={{ provider: "Tanium" }} />
5. Enter the **Client Secret** and **Rest API URL** you noted down above.
6. Choose a **Polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query Tanium for information.
7. Select **Save**.

<Render file="posture/test-posture-provider" />

### 3. Configure the posture check

<Render file="posture/configure-posture-check" params={{ one: "Tanium" }} />

## Device posture attributes

Device posture data is gathered from [Tanium's EndpointRisk API](https://developer.tanium.com/site/global/apis/graphql/spectaql/index.gsp#definition-EndpointRisk). To learn more about how scores are calculated, refer to the [Tanium risk score documentation](https://help.tanium.com/bundle/ug_benchmark_cloud/page/benchmark/risk_score.html).

| Selector    | Description   | Value |
| ----------- | ------ | --- |
| Total score | `totalScore` of the device. |  `1` to `1000` |
| Risk level | `riskLevel` of the device. | Low, medium, high, or critical |
| EID last seen | Elapsed time since the device was last seen, based on its `datetime` attribute. | In the last 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or more than 30 days |
