5. Go to **Certificates & Secrets** and select **New client secret**.
6. Fill in a description and how long the secret should be valid.
7. After completing the form, immediately copy the resulting secret. This will be your Client Secret.
8. Go to **API Permissions** and select **Add permission**.
9. Select **Microsoft Graph**.
10. Select **Application permissions**.
11. Add `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`.
12. If the permission status shows **Not granted**, select **Grant admin consent**.

## 2. Add Intune as a service provider

<Render file="posture/add-service-provider" params={{ provider: "Microsoft Endpoint Manager" }} />
5. Enter the **Client ID**, **Client secret** and **Customer ID** as you noted down above.
6. Select a **Polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query Microsoft Graph API for information.

## Device posture attributes

The Microsoft Endpoint Manager device posture check relies on information from the Microsoft Graph API. Refer to Microsoft's [ComplianceState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-devices-compliancestate?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [List managedDevices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/intune-devices-manageddevice-list?view=graph-rest-1.0) documentation for a list of properties returned by the API.

To learn more about how to control ComplianceState, refer to Microsoft's [compliance policies guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started).
