Cloudflare Zero Trust can integrate with SentinelOne to require that users connect to certain applications from managed devices. Our service-to-service posture check identifies devices based on their serial numbers.

## Prerequisites

* SentinelOne agent is deployed on the device.
* <Render file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed" params={{ name: "Service providers", link: "/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/service-providers/" }} />

## Set up SentinelOne as a service provider

### 1. Obtain SentinelOne settings

The following SentinelOne values are needed to set up the SentinelOne posture check:

* API Token
* REST API URL

To retrieve those values:

1. Log in to your SentinelOne Dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Users** > **Create new Service User**.
3. Select **Create New Service User**.
4. Enter a **Name** and **Expiration Date** and select **Next**.
5. Set **Scope of Access** to *Viewer*.
6. Select **Create User**. SentinelOne will generate an API Token for this user.
7. Copy the **API Token** to a safe location.
8. Select **Close**.
9. Copy the **Rest API URL** from your browser's address bar (for example, `https://<S1-DOMAIN>.sentinelone.net`).

### 2. Add SentinelOne as a service provider

<Render file="posture/add-service-provider" params={{ provider: "SentinelOne" }} />
5. In **Client Secret**, enter your **API Token**.
6. In **Rest API URL**, enter `https://<S1-DOMAIN>.sentinelone.net`.
7. Choose a **Polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query SentinelOne for information.
8. Select **Save**.

<Render file="posture/test-posture-provider" />

### 3. Configure the posture check

<Render file="posture/configure-posture-check" params={{ one: "SentinelOne" }} />

## Device posture attributes

Device posture data is gathered from the SentinelOne Management APIs. For more information, refer to `https://<S1-DOMAIN>.sentinelone.net/api-doc/overview`.

### Detect user risk behavior

SentinelOne provides endpoint detection and response (EDR) signals to determine [user risk score](/cloudflare-one/insights/risk-score/). User risk scores allow you to detect users that present security risks to your organization. For more information, refer to [Predefined risk behaviors](/cloudflare-one/insights/risk-score/#predefined-risk-behaviors).
