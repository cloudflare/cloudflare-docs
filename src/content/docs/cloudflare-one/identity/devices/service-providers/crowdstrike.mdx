<Render file="posture/service-provider-intro" params={{ one: "Crowdstrike" }} />

## Prerequisites

Device posture with Crowdstrike requires:

* Falcon Enterprise plan or above
* Crowdstrike agent is deployed on the device.
* <Render file="posture/prereqs-warp-is-deployed" params={{ name: "Service providers", link: "/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/service-providers/" }} />

## Set up CrowdStrike as a service provider

### 1. Obtain CrowdStrike settings

The following CrowdStrike values are needed to set up the CrowdStrike posture check:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Base URL
* Customer ID

To retrieve those values:

1. Log in to your Falcon Dashboard.
2. Go to **Support and resources** > **API Clients and Keys**.
3. Select **Add new API client** and enter any name for the client.
4. Enable the **Read** API Scope for **Zero Trust Assessment**, **Hosts**, **Detections**, **Event Streams**, and **User Management**.
5. Select **Add**.
6. Copy the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Base URL** to a safe place.
7. Go to **Host setup and management** > **Sensor downloads** and copy your Customer ID.
8. Get an auth token from your CrowdStrike API endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "<BASE_URL>/oauth2/token" \
       -H "accept: application/json" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       -d "client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>"
   ```

   This POST request authorizes Cloudflare Zero Trust to [add CrowdStrike as a service provider](#2-add-crowdstrike-as-a-service-provider). For more information, refer to the Crowdstrike [auth token documentation](https://falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com/documentation/93/oauth2-auth-token-apis).

### 2. Add CrowdStrike as a service provider

<Render file="posture/add-service-provider" params={{ provider: "Crowdstrike" }} />
5. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** you noted down above.
6. Enter your **Rest API URL**.
7. Enter your **Customer ID**.
8. Choose a **Polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query CrowdStrike for information.
9. Select **Save**.

### 3. Configure the posture check

<Render file="posture/configure-posture-check" params={{ one: "Crowdstrike" }} />
