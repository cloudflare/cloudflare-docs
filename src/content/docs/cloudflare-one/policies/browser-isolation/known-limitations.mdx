Below, you will find information regarding the current limitations for Browser Isolation.

## Website compatibility

Our Network Vector Rendering (NVR) technology allows us to deliver a secure remote computing experience without the bandwidth limitations of video streams. While we expect most websites to work perfectly, some browser features and web technologies are unsupported and will be implemented in the future:

* Webcam and microphone support is unavailable.
* Websites that use WebGL may not function. To turn off WebGL in the browser, refer to [WebGL Rendering Error](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#i-see-webgl-rendering-error).
* Netflix and Spotify Web Player are unavailable.

## Browser compatibility

* Modern Chromium, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Edge (Chromium) and Opera are supported.
* Internet Explorer 11 and below is unsupported.

## Virtual machines

Browser Isolation is not supported in virtualized environments (VMs).

## Gateway selectors

Certain selectors for Gateway HTTP policies bypass Browser Isolation, including:

* [Destination Continent IP Geolocation](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#destination-continent)
* [Destination Country IP Geolocation](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#destination-country)
* [Destination IP](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#destination-ip)

You cannot use these selectors to isolate traffic, and isolation matches for these selectors will not appear in your Gateway logs.

## File download size

When a user downloads a file within the remote browser, the file is held in memory and destroyed at the end of the remote browser session. Therefore, the total size of files downloaded per session is shared with the amount of memory available to the remote browser. We recommend a maximum individual file size of 512MB.

## Multifactor authentication

[Clientless Web Isolation](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/) does not support Yubikey or WebAuthN. These authentication technologies require the isolated website to use the same domain name as the non-isolated website. Therefore, they will not work with prefixed Clientless Web Isolation URLs but will work normally for [in-line deployments](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/) such as [isolated Access applications](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/isolate-application/).

## SAML applications

When Browser Isolation is [deployed in-line](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/) (for example, via WARP, Gateway proxy endpoint or Magic WAN) it is possible to configure a subset of traffic to be isolated. Browser Isolation segregates local and remote browsing contexts. Due to this, cross-domain interactions (such as single sign-on) may not function as expected.

### `POST` request returns `405` error

This error typically occurs due to SAML HTTP-POST bindings. These are not yet supported between non-isolated Identity Providers (IdP) and isolated Service Providers (SP).

### Workarounds

The following workarounds enable isolating SAML applications with Browser Isolation.

#### Use SAML HTTP-Redirect bindings

Configure your SAML implementation to use HTTP Redirect Bindings. This avoids the HTTP `405` error by using URL parameters to route SAMLResponse data into the isolated SP.

#### Clientless Web Isolation

Direct your users to use access the application via [Clientless Web Isolation](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/). Clientless Web Isolation implicitly isolates all traffic (both IdP and SP) and supports HTTP-POST SAML bindings.

For user convenience, [create a bookmark](/cloudflare-one/applications/bookmarks/) in Cloudflare Access for your application (for example, `https://<authdomain>.cloudflareaccess.com/browser/https://example.com`).

:::note

IdP sessions are not shared between the non-isolated IdP and the Clientless Web Isolation IdP. Users will be prompted to establish an additional session with their IdP.
:::

#### Add the application to Access

Configure a [self-hosted application](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) in Cloudflare Access and [enable browser isolation](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/isolate-application/) in the application settings.

#### Isolate both Identity Provider and Service Provider

The HTTP `405` error does not occur when both the IdP and SP are isolated.



| Order | Selector    | Operator | Value                                    | Action  |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1     | Application | In       | Your Identity Provider, Your Application | Isolate |



:::note

SAML HTTP-POST attempts initiated from the remote browser are not forwarded to non-Isolated SPs. All SPs should be isolated to avoid SSO errors.
:::

#### In-line SSO between Okta and Salesforce

Some applications that use HTTP-POST bindings (for example, Salesforce) complete SSO with an internal HTTP Redirect. Applying a Do Not Isolate policy to the SAML HTTP-POST endpoint enables the SAML flow to complete, and authenticate the user into the application in the remote browser.
