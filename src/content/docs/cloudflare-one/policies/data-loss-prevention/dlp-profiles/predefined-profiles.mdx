Cloudflare Zero Trust provides predefined DLP profiles for common types of sensitive data. Some profiles include built-in validation checks to increase detection granularity. Additionally, you can configure [advanced settings](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/advanced-settings/) for predefined profiles.

## Credentials and secrets
