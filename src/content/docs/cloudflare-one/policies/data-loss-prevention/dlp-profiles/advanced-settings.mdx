This page lists the advanced settings available when configuring a [predefined](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles/) or [custom](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/#build-a-custom-profile) DLP profile.

## Match count

Match count refers to the number of times that any enabled entry in the profile can be detected before an action is triggered, such as blocking or logging. For example, if you select a match count of 10, the scanned file or HTTP body must contain 11 or more matching strings. Detections do not have to be unique.

## Context analysis

Context analysis restricts detections based on proximity keywords to prevent false positives. Proximity keywords must be detected within a distance of 1000 bytes (~1000 characters) from the original detection to trigger an context-aware detection. For example, the string `123-45-6789` will only count as a detection if in proximity to keywords such as `ssn`.

DLP will apply context analysis to traffic and the content of [supported files](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/#supported-file-types). Supported detections include the [Financial Information](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles/#financial-information) and [Social Security, Insurance, Tax, and Identifier Numbers](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles/#social-security-insurance-tax-and-identifier-numbers) predefined profiles.

### Exclude files from context analysis

You can exclude the content of files from context analysis while still applying context analysis to traffic. For example, if you send an email containing the string `123-45-6789`, DLP will only count a detection if the string is in proximity to keywords such as `ssn`. If you include a file in an email containing the string `123-45-6789`, DLP will match a detection regardless of keywords.

To exclude file content from context analysis, in **Exclude content type**, choose _Files_.

## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) <Badge text="Beta" variant="caution" size="small" />

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) analyzes and interprets text within image files. When used with DLP profiles, OCR can detect sensitive data within images your users upload.

OCR supports scanning `.jpg`/`.jpeg` and `.png` files between 4 KB and 1 MB in size. Text is encoded in UTF-8 format, including support for non-Latin characters.
