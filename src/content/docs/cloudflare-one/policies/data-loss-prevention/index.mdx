## Data in transit

Data Loss Prevention complements [Secure Web Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/) to detect sensitive data transferred in HTTP requests. DLP scans the entire HTTP body, which may include uploaded or downloaded files, chat messages, forms, and other web content. You can also use DLP with [Email Security](/cloudflare-one/email-security/) to scan [outbound emails](/cloudflare-one/email-security/outbound-dlp/).

DLP requires [Gateway HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/initial-setup/http/) with [TLS decryption](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/) for visibility into data in transit. The depth of visibility varies for each site or application. DLP does not scan any traffic that bypasses Cloudflare Gateway (such as traffic that matches a [Do Not Inspect](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) policy).

To get started, refer to [Scan HTTP traffic with DLP](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/).

## Data at rest

Data Loss Prevention complements [Cloudflare CASB](/cloudflare-one/applications/scan-apps/) to detect sensitive data stored in your SaaS applications. Unlike data in transit scans which read files sent through Cloudflare Gateway, CASB retrieves files directly via the API. Therefore, Gateway and WARP settings (such as [Do Not Inspect](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) policies and [Split Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/) configurations) will not affect data at rest scans.

To get started, refer to [Scan SaaS applications with DLP](/cloudflare-one/applications/scan-apps/casb-dlp/).

## Supported file types

### Formats

DLP supports scanning the following file types:

- Text and CSV
- Microsoft Office 2007 and later (`.docx`, `.xlsx,` `.pptx`), including Microsoft 365
- PDF
- ZIP files containing the above

DLP will scan the text contained in Microsoft Office and PDF files.

### Size

The maximum file size is 100 MB. Size limitation is assessed against the file after unzipping. ZIP files can be recursively compressed a maximum of 10 times.
