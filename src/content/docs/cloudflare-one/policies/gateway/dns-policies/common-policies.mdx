## Restrict access to specific groups

Filter DNS queries to allow only specific users access.

The following example includes two policies. The first policy allows the specified group, while the second policy blocks all other users. To ensure the policies are evaluated properly, place the Allow policy above the Block policy. For more information, refer to the [order of precedence](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence).

### 1. Allow a group

| Selector           | Operator | Value            | Logic | Action |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Content Categories | in       | Social Networks  | And   | Allow  |
| User Group Names   | in       | `marketing-team` |       |        |

### 2. Block all other users

| Selector           | Operator | Value           | Action |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------- | ------ |
| Content Categories | in       | Social Networks | Block  |

## Control IP version

Enterprise users can pair these policies with an [egress policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/) to control which IP address is used to egress to the origin server.

:::note

To ensure traffic routes via your preferred IP version, disable **Display block page**.
