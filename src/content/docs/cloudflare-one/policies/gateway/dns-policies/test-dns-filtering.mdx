This section covers how to validate your Gateway DNS configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you are connected to a network that is associated with the [DNS location](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/) where the policy is applied.

## Test a DNS policy

Once you have created a DNS policy to block a domain, you can use either `dig` or `nslookup` to see if the policy is working as intended.

For example, if you created a policy to block `example.com`, you can do the following to see if Gateway is successfully blocking `example.com`:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Type `dig example.com` (`nslookup example.com` if you are using Windows) and press **Enter**.

3. If the [block page](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/configuring-block-page/) is disabled for the policy, you should see `REFUSED` in the answer section:

   ```sh
   dig example.com
   ```

   ```sh {4} output

   ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> example.com
   ;; global options: +cmd
   ;; Got answer:
   ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: REFUSED, id: 6503
   ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;example.com.                   IN      A

   ;; Query time: 46 msec
   ;; SERVER: 172.64.36.1#53(172.64.36.1)
   ;; WHEN: Tue Mar 10 20:22:18 CDT 2020
   ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 29
   ```

   If the [block page](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/configuring-block-page/) is enabled for the policy, you should see `NOERROR` in the answer section and `162.159.36.12` and `162.159.46.12` as the answers:

   ```sh null
   dig example.com
   ```

   ```sh {4,13,14} output

   ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> example.com
   ;; global options: +cmd
   ;; Got answer:
   ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR id: 14531
   ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

   ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:

   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;example.com.                   IN      A

   ;;ANSWER SECTION:

   example.com.            60      IN      A                  162.159.46.12

   ;; Query time: 53 msec
   ;; SERVER: 172.64.36.1#53(172.64.36.1)
   ;; WHEN: Tue Mar 10 20:19:52 CDT 2020
   ;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 83
   ```

### Test a security or content category

If you are blocking a [security category](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#security-categories) or a [content category](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#content-categories), you can test that the policy is working by using the [test domain](#common-test-domains) associated with each category.

Once you have configured your Gateway policy to block the category, the test domain will show a block page when you attempt to visit the domain in your browser, or will return `REFUSED` when you perform `dig` using the command-line interface.

#### Test domain format

- **One-word category** — For categories with one-word names (for example, _Malware_), the test domain uses the following format:

  ```txt
  <NAME_OF_CATEGORY>.testcategory.com
  ```

- **Multi-word category** — For categories with multiple words in the name (for example, _Parked & For Sale Domains_), the test domain uses the following format:

  - Remove any spaces between the words
  - Replace `&` with `and`
  - Lowercase all letters

#### Common test domains

| Category                       | Test domain                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| _Anonymizer_                   | `anonymizer.testcategory.com`                 |
| _Command and Control & Botnet_ | `commandandcontrolandbotnet.testcategory.com` |
| _Cryptomining_                 | `cryptomining.testcategory.com`               |
| _Malware_                      | `malware.testcategory.com`                    |
| _New Domains_                  | `newdomains.testcategory.com`                 |
| _Parked & For Sale Domains_    | `parkedandforsaledomains.testcategory.com`    |
| _Phishing_                     | `phishing.testcategory.com`                   |
| _Private IP Address_           | `privateipaddress.testcategory.com`           |
| _Spam_                         | `spam.testcategory.com`                       |
| _Spyware_                      | `spyware.testcategory.com`                    |
| _Unreachable_                  | `unreachable.testcategory.com`                |

## Test EDNS configuration

If you [enabled EDNS client subnet](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/) for your DNS location, you can validate EDNS as follows:

1. Obtain your DNS location's DOH subdomain:

   1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Gateway** > **DNS locations**.
   2. Select the DNS location you are testing.
   3. Note the value of **DNS over HTTPS**.

2. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```sh
   curl 'https://<DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query?type=TXT&name=o-o.myaddr.google.com' -H 'Accept: application/dns-json' | json_pp
   ```

   The output should contain your EDNS client subnet:

   ```json null {12}
   {
   	"AD": false,
   	"Answer": [
   		{
   			"TTL": 60,
   			"data": "\"108.162.218.211\"",
   			"name": "o-o.myaddr.google.com",
   			"type": 16
   		},
   		{
   			"TTL": 60,
   			"data": "\"edns0-client-subnet 136.62.0.0/24\"",
   			"name": "o-o.myaddr.google.com",
   			"type": 16
   		}
   	],
   	"CD": false,
   	"Question": [
   		{
   			"name": "o-o.myaddr.google.com",
   			"type": 16
   		}
   	],
   	"RA": true,
   	"RD": true,
   	"Status": 0,
   	"TC": false
   }
   ```

3. To verify your EDNS client subnet, obtain your source IP address:

   ```sh
   curl ifconfig.me
   ```

   ```sh output
   136.62.12.156%
   ```

   The source IP address should fall within the /24 range specified by your EDNS client subnet.

## Clear DNS cache

Modern web browsers and operating systems are designed to cache DNS records for a set amount of time. When a request is made for a DNS record, the browser cache is the first location checked for the requested record. A DNS policy may not appear to work if the response is already cached.

To clear your DNS cache:

<Details header="ChromeOS">

1. Go to `chrome://net-internals/#dns`.
2. Select **Clear host cache**.

</Details>

<Details header="Windows">

1. Open the admin command prompt or PowerShell.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
ipconfig /flushdns
```

</Details>

<Details header="macOS">

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following commands:

```sh
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```

</Details>
