Gateway supports inspection of HTTP/3 traffic, which uses the QUIC protocol over UDP. HTTP/3 inspection requires traffic to be proxied over UDP.

Gateway applies HTTP policies to HTTP/3 traffic last. For more information, refer to the [order of enforcement](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/order-of-enforcement/#http3-traffic).

## Enable HTTP/3 inspection

To enable HTTP/3 inspection:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. Under **Firewall**, enable **Proxy** and select **UDP**.
3. Enable **TLS decryption**.

### Application limitations

Gateway can inspect HTTP/3 traffic from Microsoft Edge, as well as other HTTP applications, such as cURL.

By default, the following browsers do not support HTTP/3 inspection unless you [disable QUIC](#prevent-inspection-bypass):

- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox

If the [UDP proxy](#enable-http3-inspection) is enabled in Zero Trust, Gateway will force all HTTP/3 traffic in these browsers to fall back to HTTP/2, allowing you to enforce your HTTP policies. If the UDP proxy is not enabled, HTTP/3 traffic will bypass inspection.

## Prevent inspection bypass

To prevent HTTP/3 traffic from bypassing inspection, disable QUIC in your users' browsers.
