With Cloudflare Zero Trust, you can create Secure Web Gateway policies that filter outbound traffic down to the user identity level. To do that, you can build DNS, HTTP or Network policies using a set of [identity-based selectors](#identity-based-selectors). These selectors require you to deploy the Zero Trust WARP client in [Gateway with WARP mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/).

You may also filter outbound traffic based on additional signals from [device posture checks](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/).

## Gateway identity checks

Gateway checks identity when a user logs in or re-authenticates. To check your users' identities and require re-authentication at regular intervals, you can [enforce a WARP client session duration](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-sessions/).

Unless you use an [IdP that supports SCIM provisioning](#automatic-scim-idp-updates), Gateway will not detect when you add or remove a user from a group in your IdP until the user re-authenticates to your Zero Trust instance. There are two ways a user can re-authenticate:

- Log out from an Access-protected application and log back in.
- In their WARP client settings, select **Preferences** > **Account** > **Re-Authenticate Session**. This will open a browser window and prompt the user to log in.

To view the identity that Gateway will use when evaluating policies, check the [user registry](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/users/).

### Automatic SCIM IdP updates

Gateway will automatically detect changes in user name, title, and group membership for IdPs configured with System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning. IdPs that support SCIM include:

<Render file="access/scim-supported-idps" />

For more information, refer to [SCIM provisioning](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/scim/).

## Identity-based selectors

### SAML Attributes

Specify a value from the SAML Attribute Assertion.

| UI name         | API example                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| SAML Attributes | `identity.saml_attributes == "\"group=finance\""` |

### User Email

Use this selector to create identity-based Gateway rules based on a user's email.

| UI name    | API example value                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| User Email | `identity.email == "user-name@company.com"` |

### User Group IDs

Use this selector to create identity-based Gateway rules based on an IdP group ID of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

| UI name        | API example                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| User Group IDs | `identity.groups.id == "12jf495bhjd7893ml09o"` |

### User Group Email

Use this selector to create identity-based Gateway rules based on an IdP group email address of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

| UI name          | API example                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| User Group Email | `identity.groups.id == "contractors@company.com"` |

### User Group Names

Use this selector to create identity-based Gateway rules based on an IdP group name of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

| UI name          | API example                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| User Group Names | `identity.groups.name == "\"finance\""` |

### User Name

Use this selector to create identity-based Gateway rules based on an IdP username for a particular user in the IdP.

| UI name   | API example                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| User Name | `identity.name == "user-name"` |

:::note[Gateway groups vs. Access groups]

In Gateway, a **User Group** refers to a group in your IdP (for example, an Okta group). Gateway does not currently support applying DNS, HTTP, and Network policies to [Access groups](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/groups/). This is because Access groups may include criteria not available through the IdP, such as device location or IP address.

:::

## IdP groups in Gateway

Cloudflare Gateway can integrate with your organization's identity providers (IdPs). Before building a Gateway policy for IdP users or groups, be sure to [add the IdP as an authentication method](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/).

Because IdPs expose user groups in different formats, reference the list below to choose the appropriate identity-based selector.

### Azure AD

| Selector       | Value                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User Group IDs | `61503835-b6fe-4630-af88-de551dd59a2` |

**Value** is the [Object Id](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/azuread/#azure-groups-in-zero-trust-policies) for an Azure group.

If you enabled user and group synchronization with [SCIM](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/azuread/#synchronize-users-and-groups), the synchronized groups will appear under _User Group Names_:

| Selector         | Value        |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| User Group Names | `SCIM group` |

### GitHub

| Selector         | Value       |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| User Group Names | `Marketing` |

### Google

| Selector         | Value       |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| User Group Names | `Marketing` |

### Okta (OIDC)

If you added Okta as an [OIDC provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/okta/), use the User Group Names selector:

| Selector         | Value       |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| User Group Names | `Marketing` |

The Okta OIDC integration supports user and group synchronization with [SCIM](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/okta/#synchronize-users-and-groups).

### Okta (SAML)

If you added Okta as a [SAML provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/okta-saml/), use the SAML Attributes selector:

| Selector        | Attribute name | Attribute value |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| SAML Attributes | `groups`       | `Marketing`     |

### Generic SAML IdP

For a [generic SAML provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/generic-saml/), use the SAML Attribute selector:

| Selector        | Attribute name | Attribute value |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| SAML Attributes | `department`   | `Marketing`     |

### Generic OIDC IdP

Custom OIDC claims are not supported in Gateway policies.
