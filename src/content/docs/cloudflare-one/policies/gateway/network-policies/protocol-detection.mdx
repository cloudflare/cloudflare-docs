Gateway supports the detection, logging, and filtering of network protocols using packet attributes.

Protocol detection only applies to devices connected to Zero Trust via the WARP client in [Gateway with WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#gateway-with-warp-default) mode.

## Turn on protocol detection

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Network** > **Firewall**.
2. Turn on **Protocol Detection**.

You can now use *Detected Protocol* as a selector in a [Network policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/#detected-protocol).

## Supported protocols

Gateway supports detection and filtering of the following protocols:

| Protocol | Notes                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP     | The policy builder includes separate values for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.                        |
| SSH      |                                                                                             |
| TLS      | Gateway detects TLS versions 1.1 through 1.3 with the *TLS* value.                          |
| DCE/RPC  |                                                                                             |
| MQTT     |                                                                                             |
| TPKT     | TPKT commonly initiates RDP sessions, so you can use it to identify and filter RDP traffic. |
| DNP3     |                                                                                             |

## Example network policy

You can create network policies that filter traffic based on protocol detections rather than common ports. For example, you can block all SSH traffic on your network without blocking port 22 or any other non-default ports:

| Selector          | Operator | Value | Action |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Detected Protocol | in       | *SSH* | Block  |
