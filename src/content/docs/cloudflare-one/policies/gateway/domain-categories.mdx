Cloudflare Gateway allows you to block known and potential security risks on the public Internet, as well as specific categories of content. Domains are categorized by [Cloudflare Radar](/radar/glossary/#content-categories).

<Render file="gateway/domain-categories" />

You can block security and content categories by creating DNS or HTTP policies. Once you have configured your policies, you will be able to inspect network activity and the associated categories in your Gateway logs.

To request changes to a domain's categorization, refer to [Change categorization](/security-center/investigate/change-categorization/). For more information on investigating potentially risky domains, refer to [Investigate threats](/security-center/investigate/investigate-threats/#domain).

:::note[Subdomain category]

Subdomains that have not been assigned a category will inherit the category of their parent domain. When Gateway categorizes a subdomain, the subdomain will carry only its own category. Categorized subdomains will not inherit their parent domain's categories.

## Filtering options

### Filter traffic by resolved IP category

When creating a DNS policy for security or content categories, you can optionally turn on **Filter traffic by resolved IP category** in the policy settings. When turned on, Gateway will block queries based on their resolved IP address in addition to the domain name. This setting may increase the number of false positives because domains in the blocked category can share IP addresses with legitimate domains.

### Ignore `CNAME` domain categories

The categories for a site's `CNAME` records may differ from its `A` record. For example, `blog.example.com` may be categorized under Personal Blogs, while `example.com` is categorized under Technology. To limit matches for a DNS policy to only the root domain's categories, turn on **Ignore CNAME domain categories**.

Regardless of this setting, `CNAME` domain categories will still appear in your Gateway [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/) logs.

## Categorization process

Cloudflare's domain categorization engine begins with multiple data sources, including:

1. Cloudflare's proprietary data using our global network.

2. Third-party intelligence feeds. Cloudflare uses data from over 30 open-source intelligence feeds and premium commercial feeds, such as Avira and Zvelo.

Then, the initial categorization is refined via:

3. Machine learning models. Our algorithms, including DGA Domains, DNS tunneling, and phishing detection models analyze patterns and behaviors to detect new and evolving threats.

4. Community feedback. Through a review process, Cloudflare assesses feedback by both our internal models and threat analysts. This ensures that our categorizations reflect the most current and accurate threat intelligence.
