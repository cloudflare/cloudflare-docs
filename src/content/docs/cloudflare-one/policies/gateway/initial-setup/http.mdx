Secure Web Gateway allows you to inspect HTTP traffic and control which websites users can visit.

:::note

For a more detailed guide to filtering HTTP requests and other traffic for your organization, refer to the [Secure your Internet traffic and SaaS apps](/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/) implementation guide.
:::

## 1. Connect to Gateway

To filter HTTP requests from a device:

1. [Install the Cloudflare root certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/) on your device.
2. [Install the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/) on your device.
3. In the WARP client Settings, log in to your organization's <GlossaryTooltip term="team name">Zero Trust instance</GlossaryTooltip>.
4. [Enable the Gateway proxy](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/proxy/#enable-the-gateway-proxy) for TCP. Optionally, you can enable the UDP proxy to inspect all port 443 UDP traffic.
5. To inspect HTTPS traffic, [enable TLS decryption](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#enable-tls-decryption).
6. (Optional) To scan file uploads and downloads for malware, [enable anti-virus scanning](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/antivirus-scanning/).

## 2. Verify device connectivity

<Render
	file="gateway/verify-connectivity"
	params={{ one: "HTTP", two: "requests" }}
/>

## 3. Add recommended policies

To create a new HTTP policy, go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies** > **HTTP** in Zero Trust.
We recommend adding the following policies:

### Bypass inspection for incompatible applications

Bypass HTTP inspection for applications which use [embedded certificates](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/tls-decryption/#inspection-limitations). This will help avoid any incompatibilities that may arise from an initial rollout. By the _Do Not Inspect_ app type, Gateway will filter any new applications when they are added to the group.

<Render file="gateway/policies/do-not-inspect-applications" />

### Block all security categories

Block [known threats](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/#security-categories) such as Command & Control, Botnet and Malware based on Cloudflare's threat intelligence.

<Render file="gateway/policies/block-security-categories" />

## 4. Add optional policies

Refer to our list of [common HTTP policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/common-policies) for other policies you may want to create.
