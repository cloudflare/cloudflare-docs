Application paths define the URLs protected by an Access policy. When adding a [self-hosted web application](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) to Access, you can choose to protect the entire website by entering its apex domain, or alternatively, protect specific subdomains and paths.

## Policy inheritance

Cloudflare Zero Trust allows you to create unique rules for parts of an application that share a root path. Imagine an example application is deployed at `dashboard.com/eng` that anyone on the engineering team should be able to access. However, a tool deployed at `dashboard.com/eng/exec` should only be accessed by the executive team.

When multiple rules are set for a common root path, the more specific rule takes precedence. For example, when setting rules for `dashboard.com/eng` and `dashboard.com/eng/exec` separately, the more specific rule for `dashboard.com/eng/exec` takes precedence, and no rule is inherited from `dashboard.com/eng`. If no separate, specific rule is set for `dashboard.com/eng/exec`, it will inherit any rules set for `dashboard.com/eng`.

## Wildcards

When you create an application for a specific subdomain or path, you can use asterisks (`*`) as wildcards. Wildcards allow you to extend the application you are creating to multiple subdomains or paths in a given apex domain.

### Examples

#### Match all subdomains of an apex domain

Using a wildcard in the **Subdomain** field does not cover the apex domain.

| Application     | Covers                                       | Does not cover |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `*.example.com` | `alpha.example.com` <br/> `beta.example.com` | `example.com`  |

#### Match all paths of an apex domain

To protect an apex domain and all of the paths under it, leave the **Path** field empty. Alternatively, use a wildcard in the **Path** field.

| Application                            | Covers                                                           | Does not cover      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `example.com` <br/> or `example.com/*` | `example.com` <br/> `example.com/alpha` <br/> `example.com/beta` | `alpha.example.com` |

#### Match multi-level subdomains

Using a wildcard in the **Subdomain** field does not cover the parent subdomain nor the apex domain.

| Application          | Covers                                                 | Does not cover                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `*.test.example.com` | `alpha.test.example.com` <br/> `beta.test.example.com` | `test.example.com`  <br/> `example.com` |

#### Partially match subdomains

Using a wildcard at the beginning or end of the **Subdomain** field does not cover multiple levels of the subdomain.

| Application         | Covers                                           | Does not cover          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `*test.example.com` | `test.example.com` <br/> `alphatest.example.com` | `beta.test.example.com` |

#### Match multi-level paths

Using a wildcard in the **Path** field does not cover the parent path nor the apex domain.

| Application           | Covers                                                | Does not cover                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `example.com/alpha/*` | `example.com/alpha/one` <br/> `example.com/alpha/two` | `example.com/alpha` <br/> `example.com` |

#### Partially match paths

Using a wildcard in the middle of the **Path** field covers multiple segments of the URL.

| Application            | Covers                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `example.com/foo*/bar` | `example.com/foo/bar`<br/> `example.com/food/bar` <br/> `example.com/food/stuff/bar` |

### Limitations

* At most one wildcard in between each dot in the **Subdomain**. For example, `foo*bar*baz.example.com` is not allowed.
* At most one wildcard in between each slash in the **Path**. For example, `example.com/foo*bar*baz` is not allowed.

## Subdomain setups

[Subdomain setups](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/) allow you to manage a child domain separately from its parent domain. In Access application paths, your configured child domains will appear in the **Domain** dropdown menu. If you [split out a subdomain](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/setup/) which already has an Access application, you will need to re-save the Access application to associate it with the new child domain.

## Unsupported URLs

### Port numbers

Port numbers are not supported in Access application paths. If a request includes a port number in the URL, Access will strip the port number and redirect the request to the default HTTP/HTTPS port.

### Anchor links

Since anchor links are processed by the browser and not the server, Access applications do not support `#` characters in the URL. For example, requests to `dashboard.com/#settings` will redirect to `dashboard.com`.
