Cloudflare Access allows security and IT teams to present users with a purpose justification screen directly after they log in to an Access application. This allows organizations to audit not only for *who* is accessing their resources, but also for *why* they are requesting access.

The purpose justification screen will show for any new sessions of an application. For example, if an Access application has a session time of eight hours, a user will see the purpose justification screen once every eight hours.

Configuring a purpose justification screen is done as part of configuring an Access policy.

1. In Zero Trust, go to **Access** > **Applications**.
2. Select an application and select **Edit**.
3. Select the policy you want to configure with purpose justification.
4. Open **Optional Configurations**.
5. Enable purpose justification.
6. (Optional) set a custom purpose justification message. This will appear on the purpose justification screen and will be visible to the user.
7. Once configured, a user will see the following screen:
