Cloudflare can render certain non-web applications in your browser without the need for client software or end-user configuration changes. Cloudflare currently supports rendering a terminal for SSH and VNC connections in a user's browser.

:::note
You can only enable browser rendering on domains and subdomains, not for specific paths.

## Enable browser rendering

To enable browser rendering:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.
2. Locate the SSH or VNC application you created when [connecting the server to Cloudflare](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/). Select **Configure**.
3. In the **Policies** tab, ensure that only **Allow** or **Block** policies are present. **Bypass** and **Service Auth** are not supported for browser-rendered applications.
4. In the **Settings** tab, scroll down to **Additional settings**.
5. For **Browser rendering**, choose *SSH* or *VNC*.
6. Select **Save application**.

When users authenticate and visit the URL of the application, Cloudflare will render a terminal in their browser.
