When users connect to an Access application through `cloudflared`, the browser prompts them to allow access by displaying this page:

![Access request prompt page displayed after logging in with cloudflared.](~/assets/images/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/access-screen.png)

Automatic `cloudflared` authentication allows users to skip this login page if they already have an active IdP session.

To enable automatic `cloudflared` authentication:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.
2. Locate your application and select **Configure**.
3. In the **Settings** tab, scroll down to **Additional settings**.
4. Turn on **Enable automatic cloudflared authentication**.
5. Select **Save application**.

This option will still prompt a browser window in the background, but authentication will now happen automatically.
