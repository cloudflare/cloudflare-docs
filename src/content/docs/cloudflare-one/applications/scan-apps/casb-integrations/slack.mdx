## Integration prerequisites

- A Slack user account
- Membership in a Slack Workspace (Free, Pro, Business+, or Enterprise Grid)
- If you are not the Workspace Owner and the `Require App Approval` setting is enabled for the Workspace, [request permission](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-apps-to-your-Slack-workspace) to install apps.

## Integration permissions

For the Slack integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Slack API permissions:

- `channels:read`
- `files:read`
- `groups:read`
- `users:read`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Slack Permission scopes reference](https://api.slack.com/scopes).
