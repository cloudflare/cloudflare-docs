## Integration prerequisites

* A Dropbox Business plan (Standard, Advanced, Enterprise, or Education)
* Access to a Dropbox Business account with Team admin permissions

## Integration permissions

For the Dropbox integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Dropbox permissions via an OAuth 2.0 app:

* `account_info.read`
* `files.metadata.read`
* `files.content.read`
* `sharing.read`
* `team_info.read`
* `team_data.member`
* `team_data.governance.write`
* `team_data.governance.read`
* `files.team_metadata.read`
* `members.read`
* `groups.read`
* `sessions.list`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Dropbox API Permissions documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#dropbox-api-permissions).
