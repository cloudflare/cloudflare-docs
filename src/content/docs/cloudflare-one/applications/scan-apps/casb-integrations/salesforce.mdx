## Integration prerequisites

- A Salesforce environment (most editions are compatible)
- Permissions to a Salesforce organization with either:

  - System Administrator permission
  - Permissions for View Setup and Configuration, Customize Applications, and Modify All Data

## Integration permissions

For the Salesforce integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Salesforce permissions via a Connected App:

- `Manage user data via APIs (api)`
- `Manage user data via Web browsers (web)`
- `Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`
- `Access unique user identifiers (openid)`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Salesforce OAuth Tokens and Scopes documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm).
