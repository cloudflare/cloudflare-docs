:::note

At this time, the CASB integration for Jira is only compatible with Jira Cloud accounts. Support for Jira Data Center will come at a future date. 
:::

## Integration prerequisites

* A Jira Cloud plan (Free, Standard, Premium, Enterprise)

* Access to a Jira Cloud account with Site admin and/or Organization admin permissions

## Integration permissions

For the Jira Cloud integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following permissions via an OAuth 2.0 app:

* `read:jira-work`
* `read:jira-user`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Atlassian scopes documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/).
