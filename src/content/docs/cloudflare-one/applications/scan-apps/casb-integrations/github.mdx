## Integration permissions

For the GitHub integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following GitHub API permissions:

| Permission                  | Access      | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administration              | `Read-only` | View basic administrative information from the account.                                                 |
| Members                     | `Read-only` | View metadata on organization members                                                                   |
| Metadata                    | `Read-only` | View metadata surrounding an organization's assets, excluding sensitive private repository information. |
| Organization administration | `Read-only` | View information on organization settings                                                               |

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [GitHub App permissions reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps).
