## Integration prerequisites

- A Box account on a Business plan (Business, Business Plus, Enterprise, Enterprise Plus)

- Access to a Box Business account with Admin permission

## Integration permissions

For the Box integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Box permissions via an OAuth 2.0 app:

- `Read all files and folders stored in Box`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about the permission, refer to the [Box Scopes documentation](https://developer.box.com/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#read-all-files-and-folders).
