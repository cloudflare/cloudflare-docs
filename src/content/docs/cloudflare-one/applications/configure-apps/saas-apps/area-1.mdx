[Cloudflare Area 1](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/email-security/) is an email security platform that protects your organization's inbox from phishing, spam, and other malicious messages. This guide covers how to configure Area 1 as a SAML application in Cloudflare Zero Trust.

## Prerequisites

* An [identity provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/) configured in Cloudflare Zero Trust
* Admin access to your Area 1 account
* Your user's email in Area 1 matches their email in Zero Trust

## 1. Add Area 1 to Zero Trust

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.

2. Select **Add an application**.

3. Select **SaaS**.

4. In the **Application** field, enter `Area 1` and select **Area 1**. (Area 1 is not currently listed in the default drop-down menu.)

5. Enter the following values for your application configuration:
   |                                    |                                                    |
   | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Entity ID**                      | `https://horizon.area1security.com`                |
   | **Assertion Consumer Service URL** | `https://horizon.area1security.com/api/users/saml` |
   | **Name ID Format**                 | *Email*                                            |

6. (Optional) Configure [App Launcher settings](/cloudflare-one/applications/app-launcher/) for the application.

7. Choose the **Identity providers** you want to enable for your application.

8. Turn on **Instant Auth** if you are selecting only one login method for your application, and would like your end users to skip the identity provider selection step.

9. Select **Next**.

## 2. Add an Access policy

1. To control who can access your application, [create an Access policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).

2. Select **Next**.

## 3. Configure SSO for Area 1

Finally, you will need to configure Area 1 to allow users to log in through Cloudflare Access.

1. In your [Area 1 portal](https://horizon.area1security.com/), go to **Settings** > **SSO**.

2. Turn on **Single Sign On**.

3. (Optional) To require users to sign in through Access, set **SSO Enforcement** to *All*. When SSO is enforced, users will no longer be able to sign in with their Area 1 credentials.

4. In **SAML SSO Domain**, enter `<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`.

5. Get your Metadata XML file:

   1. In Zero Trust, copy the **SSO Endpoint** for your application.

   2. In a new browser tab, paste the **SSO Endpoint** and append `/saml-metadata` to the end of the URL. For example, `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/sso/saml/<app-id>/saml-metadata`.

   3. Copy the resulting metadata.

6. Return to the Area 1 portal and paste the metadata into **Metadata XML**.

7. Select **Update Settings**.

8. In Zero Trust, select **Done**.

Your application will appear on the **Applications** page. If you added the application to your App Launcher, you can test the integration by going to `<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`.
