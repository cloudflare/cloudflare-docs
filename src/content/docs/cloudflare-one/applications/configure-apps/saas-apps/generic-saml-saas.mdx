This page provides generic instructions for setting up a SaaS application in Cloudflare Access using the SAML authentication protocol.

## Prerequisites

- An [identity provider](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/) configured in Cloudflare Zero Trust
- Admin access to the account of the SaaS application

## 1. Get SaaS application URLs

Obtain the following URLs from your SaaS application account:

- **Entity ID**: A unique URL issued for your SaaS application, for example `https://<your-domain>.my.salesforce.com`.
- **Assertion Consumer Service URL**: The service provider's endpoint for receiving and parsing SAML assertions.

## 2. Add your application to Access

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.

2. Select **Add an application**.

3. Select **SaaS**.

4. Select your **Application** from the drop-down menu. If your application is not listed, enter a custom name in the **Application** field and select the textbox that appears below.

5. Select **SAML**.

6. Select **Add application**.

7. Enter the **Entity ID** and **Assertion Consumer Service URL** obtained from your SaaS application account.

8. Select the **Name ID Format** expected by your SaaS application (usually _Email_).

9. Copy the **SSO endpoint**, **Access Entity ID or Issuer**, and **Public key**.

10. If your SaaS application requires additional **SAML attribute statements**, add the mapping of your IdP's attributes you would like to include in the SAML statement sent to the SaaS application.

:::note[IdP groups]

If you are using Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Google Workspace, or GitHub as your IdP, Access will automatically send a SAML attribute titled `groups` with all of the user's associated groups as attribute values.

11. (Optional) Configure [App Launcher settings](/cloudflare-one/applications/app-launcher/) for the application.

12. <Render file="access/access-block-page" />

13. <Render file="access/access-choose-idps" />

14. Select **Save configuration**.

## 2. Add an Access policy

1. To control who can access the SaaS application, [create an Access policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/).

2. Select **Done**.

## 3. Configure SSO in your SaaS application

Next, configure your SaaS application to require users to log in through Cloudflare Access. Refer to your SaaS application documentation for instructions on how to configure a third-party SAML SSO provider. You will need the following values from the Zero Trust dashboard:

- **SSO endpoint**
- **Access Entity ID or Issuer**
- **Public key**

You can either manually enter this data into your SaaS application or upload a metadata XML file. The metadata is available at the URL: `<SSO endpoint>/saml-metadata`.

### Validate SAML Response

When acting as a SAML identity provider, Cloudflare will sign both the SAML Response and the SAML Assertion using the SHA-256 algorithm. The SaaS application can validate this signature using the **Public key** that you upload to the SaaS application.

## 4. Test the integration

Open an incognito browser window and go to the SaaS application's login URL. You will be redirected to the Cloudflare Access login screen and prompted to sign in with your identity provider.
