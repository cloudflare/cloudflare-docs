Cloudflare Access allows you to add an additional authentication layer to your SaaS applications. When you integrate a SaaS application with Access, users log in to the application with Cloudflare as the Single Sign-On provider. The user is then redirected to the configured identity providers for that application and are only granted access if they pass your Access policies.
