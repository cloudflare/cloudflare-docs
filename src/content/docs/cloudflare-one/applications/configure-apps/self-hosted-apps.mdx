![Cloudflare Access authenticates users to your internal applications.](~/assets/images/cloudflare-one/applications/network-diagram.png)

## Prerequisites

* An [active domain on Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/)
* Domain uses either a [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) or a [partial (`CNAME`) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/)

## 1. Add your application to Access

<Render file="access/self-hosted-app" />

## 2. Add an Access policy

<Render file="access/self-hosted-policy" />

## 3. (Optional) Configure advanced settings

<Render file="access/self-hosted-settings" />

## 4. Connect your origin to Cloudflare

Next, set up a [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) to make your internal application available over the Internet.

## 5. Validate the Access token

<Render file="access/secure-tunnel-with-access" />

Users can now connect to your self-hosted application after authenticating with Cloudflare Access.

## Product compatibility

When using Access self-hosted applications, the majority of Cloudflare products will be compatible with your application.

However, the following products are not supported:

* [Automatic Signed Exchanges](/speed/optimization/other/signed-exchanges/)
* [Automatic Platform Optimization](/automatic-platform-optimization)
* [Zaraz](/zaraz)

You can disable Automatic Signed Exchanges and Zaraz for a specific application - instead of across your entire zone - using a [Configuration Rule](/rules/configuration-rules/) scoped to the application domain.
