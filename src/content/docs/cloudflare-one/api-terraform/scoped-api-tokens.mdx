The administrators managing policies and groups in Cloudflare Access might be different from the users responsible for configuring WAF custom rules or other Cloudflare settings. Cloudflare Access supports [scoped API tokens](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) so that team members and automated systems can manage settings specific to Access without having permission to modify other configurations in Cloudflare.

## Creating a scoped API token

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), select the user icon > **My Profile**.

2. Select the **API Tokens** tab. The existing tokens will display.

3. Select **Create Token**.

4. Select **Get started** next to **Create Custom Token**.

5. Select **Account** and **Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups** in the drop-downs under **Permissions**. You can configure the token to be Read or Write in the third drop-down.

6. In the final section, the token can be applied to a single account or multiple if you are an administrator of multiple Cloudflare accounts.

7. Select **Continue to summary**. The next page will display the token details and instructions on how to use it.

## Review tokens

You can review tokens created in the **API Tokens** tab. In this view, you can roll, revoke, or edit issued tokens.
