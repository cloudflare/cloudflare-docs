| [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-associate-tutorials/install-cli) installed on your machine |
| The [Cloudflare provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) properly configured                 |

[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-associate-tutorials/install-cli) is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure, and provides components and documentation for building [Cloudflare resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs). Listed below are examples to help you get started with building Access with Terraform. For a more generalized guide on configuring Cloudflare and Terraform, visit our [Getting Started with Terraform and Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/getting-started-with-terraform-and-cloudflare-part-1/) blog post.

## Create an application with Terraform

1. Create an application.

   Here is an example configuration:

   ```tf
   variable "domain" {
     default = "example.com"
   }

   variable "zone_id" {
     default = <CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID>
   }

   resource "cloudflare_access_application" "cf_app" {
     zone_id          = var.zone_id
     name             = "My Example App"
     domain           = var.domain
     session_duration = "24h"
   }
   ```

2. Next, we need to export our environment variables and secrets:

   ```sh
   export CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=<CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL>
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=<CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY>
   ```

3. Now we can run a `terraform plan` which will output any proposed changes. Make sure to review the plan carefully:

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

   ```sh output
   Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
   The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
   persisted to local or remote state storage.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
   	+ create

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

   	# cloudflare_access_application.cf_app will be created
   	+ resource "cloudflare_access_application" "cf_app" {
   			+ aud              = (known after apply)
   			+ domain           = "example.com"
   			+ id               = (known after apply)
   			+ name             = "My Example App"
   			+ session_duration = "24h"
   			+ zone_id          = "1ce82492016e71df631bf4af9c02587f"
   		}

   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
   can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
   "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
   ```

4. Apply these changes using the `apply` command, once they look accurate and you're comfortable moving forward:

   ```sh
   terraform apply --auto-approve
   ```

   ```sh output
   cloudflare_access_application.cf_app: Creating...
   cloudflare_access_application.cf_app: Creation complete after 2s [id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx]

   Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
   ```

## Create a policy

After you've created an application, you can start creating policies and attaching them to applications:

```tf
   resource "cloudflare_access_policy" "cf_policy" {
     application_id = cloudflare_access_application.cf_app.id
     zone_id        = var.zone_id
     name           = "Example Policy"
     precedence     = "1"
     decision       = "allow"

     include {
       email = ["test@example.com"]
     }
   }
```

To do so:

1. Run a `terraform plan`:

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

   ```sh output

   Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
   The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
   persisted to local or remote state storage.

   cloudflare_access_application.cf_app: Refreshing state... [id=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx]

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create

   Terraform will perform the following actions:

    # cloudflare_access_policy.cf_policy will be created
    + resource "cloudflare_access_policy" "cf_policy" {
        + application_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        + decision       = "allow"
        + id             = (known after apply)
        + name           = "My Example Policy"
        + precedence     = 1
        + zone_id        = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

        + include {
            + email = [
                + "test@example.com",
              ]
          }
      }

   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
   can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
   "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
   ```

2. Next, apply these changes using the `apply` command, once they look accurate and you're comfortable moving forward:

   ```sh
   terraform apply --auto-approve
   ```

### Configuring an identity provider

The example below shows how you can configure an identity provider and attach it to a policy:

```tf
resource "cloudflare_access_identity_provider" "github_oauth" {
  account_id = <CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID>
  name       = "GitHub OAuth"
  type       = "github"
  config {
    client_id     = <GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>
    client_secret = <GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET>
  }
}

resource "cloudflare_access_policy" "cf_policy" {
  application_id = cloudflare_access_application.cf_app.id
  zone_id        = var.zone_id
  name           = "My Example Policy"
  precedence     = "1"
  decision       = "allow"

  include {
    email = ["test@example.com"]
    github {
      name                 = "My GitHub Org"
      identity_provider_id = cloudflare_access_identity_provider.github_oauth.id
    }
  }
}
```

These are the basics to get up and running with Access and Terraform. Refer to our [API documentation](/api/) for other endpoints that can be managed via Terraform.
