This section covers a few common use cases with the API and Terraform to manage Cloudflare Zero Trust. For more information, refer to our [API documentation](/api/) and [Terraform reference guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs).

## Set dashboard to read-only

Super Administrators can lock all settings as read-only in Zero Trust. Read-only mode ensures that all updates for the account are made through the API or Terraform.

To enable read-only mode:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Account**.
2. Enable **API/Terraform read-only mode**.

All users, regardless of [user permissions](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/), will be prevented from making configuration changes through the UI.
