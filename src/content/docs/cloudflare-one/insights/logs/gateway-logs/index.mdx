:::note[Private source IP substitution]

Gateway logs will only show the public IP address for the **Source IP** field. Private IP addresses are substituted by a public IP address via network address translation (NAT).

:::

Gateway activity logs show the individual DNS queries, Network packets, and HTTP requests inspected by Gateway. You can also download encrypted [SSH command logs](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/ssh-logging/) for sessions proxied by Gateway.

To view Gateway activity logs, log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Logs** > **Gateway**. Select an individual row to investigate the event in more detail.

Enterprise users can generate more detailed logs with [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/).

## Selective logging

By default, Gateway logs all events, including DNS queries and HTTP requests that are allowed and not a risk. You can choose to disable logs or only log blocked requests. To customize what type of events are recorded, log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Settings** > **Network**. Under **Activity Logging**, indicate your DNS, Network, and HTTP log preferences.

These settings will only apply to logs displayed in Zero Trust. Logpush data is unaffected.

#### File detection details

| Field            | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**         | Name of the detected file.                         |
| **Type**         | File type of the detected file.                    |
| **Size**         | Size of the detected file.                         |
| **Hash**         | Hash of the detected file, generated by DLP.       |
| **Content type** | MIME type of the detected file.                    |
| **Direction**    | Upload or download direction of the detected file. |
| **Action**       | The Action Gateway applied to the request.         |

### Enhanced file detection

Enhanced file detection is an optional feature to extract more file information from HTTP traffic. When turned on, Gateway will read file information from the HTTP body rather than the HTTP headers to provide greater accuracy and reliability. This feature may have a minor impact on performance for file-heavy organizations.

To turn on enhanced file detection:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. In **Firewall**, turn on **TLS decryption**.
3. In **Gateway Logging**, turn on **Enable enhanced file detection**.

### Isolate requests

When a user creates an [isolation policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/isolation-policies/), Gateway logs the initial request that triggers isolation as an Isolate action. Because this request is not isolated yet, the `is_isolated` field will return `false`. Zero Trust then securely returns the result to the user in an isolated browser. Gateway will log all subsequent requests in the isolated browser with the action (such as Allow or Block), and the `is_isolated` field will return `true`.

## Limitations

Gateway activity logs are not available in the dashboard if you turn on the [Customer Metadata Boundary](/data-localization/metadata-boundary/) within Cloudflare Data Localization Suite (DLS). Enterprise users using CMB can still export logs via [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/). For more information, refer to [DLS product compatibility](/data-localization/compatibility/#zero-trust).
