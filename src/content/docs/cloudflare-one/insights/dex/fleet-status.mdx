With DEX, you can monitor your users' devices and connection status.

## View metrics

To view an overview of all enrolled devices, go to **DEX** > **Monitoring**. The **Fleet Status** tab will show real-time and historical connectivity metrics for all devices in your organization.

To view analytics on a per-device level, go to **My Team** > **Devices**. The **Fleet Status** tab will show real-time and historical connectivity metrics for the selected device.

## Available metrics

* **Devices connected by colo**: Number of devices that are connected to a given [Cloudflare data center](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/).

* **Connectivity status**: Percentage of devices in a given WARP client state.

  | Status            | Description |
  |-------------------|-------------|
  | Connected    |  WARP has successfully established a connection to the Cloudflare global network.  |
  | Disconnected | WARP has been intentionally or unintentionally disconnected from the Cloudflare global network.  |
  | Paused       | A user or administrator has taken an explicit action to temporarily turn off WARP, for example by entering an [Admin Override](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#admin-override) code.  Paused clients will [auto-connect](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#auto-connect) after a timeout period. |
  | Connecting   | WARP is pending connection, but is actively trying to establish a connection to the Cloudflare global network. |


* **Mode**: [WARP mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/) deployed on the device.

* **Colo**: Percentage of devices connected to a given Cloudflare data center.

* **Platform**: Operating system of the device.

* **Major Version**: WARP client version installed on the device.

* **Device Status Over Time**: WARP client connection status over the selected time period.

* **Connection Methods Over Time**: WARP mode used by the device over the selected time period.
