import { AvailableNotifications } from "~/components"

Administrators can receive alerts when Cloudflare detects connectivity issues with the WARP client or degraded application performance. Notifications can be delivered via email, webhook, and third-party services.

## Manage notifications

DEX notifications are configured on the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/). For more information, refer to [Create a notification](/notifications/get-started/#create-a-notification).

## ​​Alert logic

### Z-score

Cloudflare uses a z-score to detect traffic spikes or drops. A [z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) is the number of standard deviations the current value is to the mean. We calculate the mean and standard deviation by comparing the current five minutes to the past four hours. This is measured every five minutes.

To trigger an alert, the z-score value must be above 3.5 or less than -3.5.

### SLO

A service-level objective (SLO) is defined as (x / y) \* 100 where x = the number of good events and y = the number of valid events for a given time period. DEX notifications look at both a short window (five minutes) and a long time window (one hour) and triggers an alert if the availability falls below the SLO threshold in either window.
