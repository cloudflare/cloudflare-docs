With Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX), you can test if your devices can connect to a private or public endpoint through the WARP client. This tool allows you to monitor availability for a given application and investigate performance issues reported by your end users. DEX tests will only run when the WARP client is turned on, whereas [fleet status](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/fleet-status/) metrics are always available.
