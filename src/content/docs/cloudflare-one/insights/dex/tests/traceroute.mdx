</Details>

A traceroute test measures the network path of an IP packet from an end-user device to a server. You can use the test results to troubleshoot network issues. For example, increased latency may indicate a problem with connectivity along the network path.

## Create a test

To set up a traceroute test for an application:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Tests**.
2. Select **Add a Test**.
3. Fill in the following fields:
   * **Name**: Enter any name for the test.
   * **Target**: Enter the IP address of the server you want to test (for example, `192.0.2.0`). You can test either a public-facing endpoint or a private endpoint you have connected to Cloudflare.
   * **Source device profiles**: (Optional) Select the [WARP device profiles](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) that you want to run the test on. If no profiles are selected, the test will run on all supported devices connected to your Zero Trust organization.
   * **Test type**: Select *Traceroute*.
   * **Test frequency**: Specify how often the test will run. Input a minute value between 5 and 60.
4. Select **Add test**.

Next, [view the results](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/view-results/) of your test.

## Test results

A traceroute test measures the following data:

| Last seen ISP                     | The Internet Service Provider that is managing the connection from the device to Cloudflare. (Only available on macOS and Windows.) <br/> <br/> DEX looks up the IP address of the ISP in the [MaxMind GeoIP2 database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-services-and-databases) and returns the corresponding [ASO and ASN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/). If the ASO and ASN are `Unknown`, it means this information is unavailable in MaxMind. |
