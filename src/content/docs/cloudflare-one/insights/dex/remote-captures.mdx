Remote captures allow administrators to collect packet captures (PCAPs) and WARP diagnostic logs directly from end user devices. This data can be used to troubleshoot network problems, investigate security incidents, and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Start a remote capture

To capture data from a remote device:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Remote captures**.
2. Select up to 10 devices that you want to run a capture on. Devices must be [registered](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/) in your Zero Trust organization.
3. Configure the types of captures to run.
	- **PCAP**: Performs packet captures for traffic outside of the WARP tunnel (default network interface) and traffic inside of the WARP tunnel ([WARP virtual interface](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/warp-architecture/#ip-traffic)).
		<Details header="PCAP capture limits">
		Packet captures are subject to the following limits:
			- **Maximum time limit**: 600 seconds
			- **Maximum file size**: 50 MB
			- **Maximum packet size**: 1500 bytes
		</Details>
	- **WARP Diagnostics Logs**: Generates a [WARP diagnostic log](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/troubleshooting/warp-logs/#warp-diag-logs) of the past 96 hours. To include a routing test for all IPs and domains in your [Split Tunnel configuration](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/), select **Test all routes**.
		<Details header="WARP capture limits">
		WARP diagnostic logs have no file size limit, but files larger than 100 MB cannot be uploaded to Cloudflare and must be shared directly with the admin.
		</Details>
4. Select **Start a capture**.

DEX will now send capture requests to the configured devices. If the WARP client is disconnected, the capture will time out after 10 minutes.

## Check remote capture status

To view a list of captures, go to **DEX** > **Remote captures**. The **Status** column displays one of the following options:
	- **Success**: The capture is complete and ready for download.
	- **Running**: The capture is in progress on the device.
	- **Pending Upload**: The capture is complete but not yet ready for download.
	- **Failed**: The capture has either timed out or encountered an error. To retry the capture, verify the [connectivity status](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/fleet-status/) of the device and start a [new capture](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/#start-a-remote-capture).

## Download remote captures

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Remote captures**.
2. Find a successful capture.
3. Select the three-dot menu and select **Download**.

This will download a ZIP file to your local machine. You can analyze `.pcap` files using Wireshark or another third-party packet capture tool.

## Data retention

Cloudflare will store capture data for 7 days.
