Wrangler is a command-line tool for building with Cloudflare developer products.

## Install Wrangler

To install [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler), ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) installed, preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Using a version manager helps avoid permission issues and allows you to change Node.js versions. Wrangler requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

Wrangler is installed locally into each of your projects. This allows you and your team to use the same Wrangler version, control Wrangler versions for each project, and roll back to an earlier version of Wrangler, if needed.

To install Wrangler within your Worker project, run:

<Render file="install_wrangler" />

Since Cloudflare recommends installing Wrangler locally in your project (rather than globally), the way to run Wrangler will depend on your specific setup and package manager. Refer to [How to run Wrangler commands](/workers/wrangler/commands/#how-to-run-wrangler-commands) for more information.

:::caution

If Wrangler is not installed, running `npx wrangler` will use the latest version of Wrangler.

:::

## Check your Wrangler version

```sh
npx wrangler --version
// or

## Update Wrangler

```sh
npm install wrangler@latest
```
