description: Review Wrangler's default bundling.
---

By default, Wrangler bundles your Worker code using [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/). This means that Wrangler has built-in support for importing modules from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) defined in your `package.json`. To review the exact code that Wrangler will upload to Cloudflare, run `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir dist`, which will show your Worker code after Wrangler's bundling.

:::note

Wrangler's inbuilt bundling usually provides the best experience, but we understand there are cases where you will need more flexibility.
You can provide `rules` and set `find_additional_modules` in your configuration to control which files are included in the deployed Worker but not bundled into the entry-point file.
Furthermore, we have an escape hatch in the form of [Custom Builds](/workers/wrangler/custom-builds/), which lets you run your own build before Wrangler's built-in one.
:::

## Including non-JavaScript modules

Bundling your Worker code takes multiple modules and bundles them into one file.
Sometimes, you might have modules that cannot be inlined directly into the bundle.
For example, instead of bundling a Wasm file into your JavaScript Worker, you would want to upload the Wasm file as a separate module that can be imported at runtime.
Wrangler supports this for the following file types:

- `.txt`
- `.html`
- `.bin`
- `.wasm` and `.wasm?module`

Refer to [Bundling configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling) to customize these file types.

For example, with the following import, the variable `data` will be a string containing the contents of `example.html`:

```js
import data from "./example.html"; // Where `example.html` is a file in your local directory
```

This is also the basis of Wasm support with Wrangler. To use a Wasm module in a Worker developed with Wrangler, add the following to your Worker:

```js
import wasm from "./example.wasm"; // Where `example.wasm` is a file in your local directory
const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm); // Instantiate Wasm modules in global scope, not within the fetch() handler

export default {
	fetch(request) {
		const result = instance.exports.exported_func();
	},
};
```

:::caution

Cloudflare Workers does not support `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()`.

## Find additional modules

By setting `find_additional_modules` to `true` in your configuration file, Wrangler will traverse the file tree below `base_dir`.
Any files that match the `rules` you define will also be included as unbundled, external modules in the deployed Worker.

This approach is useful for supporting lazy loading of large or dynamically imported JavaScript files:

- Normally a large lazy imported file (e.g. `await import("./large-dep.mjs")`) would be bundled directly into your entrypoint, making lazy loading less effective.
  If matching rule is added to `rules`, then this file would only be loaded and executed at runtime when it is actually imported.
- Previously, variable based dynamic imports (e.g. ``await import(`./lang/${language}.mjs`)``) would always fail at runtime, as Wrangler would have no way of knowing which modules to include in the upload.
  Providing a rule that matches all these files (e.g. ` { type = "EsModule", globs = ["./land/**/*.mjs"], fallthrough = true }), will ensure this module is available at runtime.
- "Partial bundling" is supported when `find_additional_modules` is `true`, and a source file matches one of the configured `rules`, since Wrangler will then treat it as "external" and not try to bundle it into the entry-point file.

## Conditional exports

Wrangler respects the [conditional `exports` field](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) in `package.json`. This allows developers to implement isomorphic libraries that have different implementations depending on the JavaScript runtime they are running in. When bundling, Wrangler will try to load the [`workerd` key](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/#workerd). Refer to the Wrangler repository for [an example isomorphic package](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/fixtures/isomorphic-random-example).

## Disable bundling

:::caution

Disabling bundling is not recommended in most scenarios. Use this option only when deploying code pre-processed by other tooling.
:::

If your build tooling already produces build artifacts suitable for direct deployment to Cloudflare, you can opt out of bundling by using the `--no-bundle` command line flag: `npx wrangler deploy --no-bundle`. If you opt out of bundling, Wrangler will not process your code and some features introduced by Wrangler bundling (for example minification, and polyfills injection) will not be available.

Use [Custom Builds](/workers/wrangler/custom-builds/) to customize what Wrangler will bundle and upload to the Cloudflare global network when you use [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) and [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy).
