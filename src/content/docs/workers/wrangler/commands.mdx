## How to run Wrangler commands

This page provides a reference for Wrangler commands.

```txt
wrangler <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]
```

Since Cloudflare recommends [installing Wrangler locally](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) in your project(rather than globally), the way to run Wrangler will depend on your specific setup and package manager.

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="wrangler" args="<COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> [PARAMETERS] [OPTIONS]" />

You can add Wrangler commands that you use often as scripts in your project's `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy",
    "dev": "wrangler dev"
  }
  ...
}
```

You can then run them using your package manager of choice:

<PackageManagers type="run" pkg="deploy" />

---

<WranglerCommand cmd="docs" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="init" />

:::caution 

The `init` command will be removed in a future version. Please use `npm create cloudflare@latest` instead. 

:::

:::

:::caution

As of Wrangler v3.2.0, `wrangler dev` is supported by any Linux distributions providing `glibc 2.31` or higher (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Debian 11/12, Fedora 37/38/39), macOS version 11 or higher, and Windows (x86-64 architecture).

:::

`wrangler dev` is a way to [locally test](/workers/testing/local-development/) your Worker while developing. With `wrangler dev` running, send HTTP requests to `localhost:8787` and your Worker should execute as expected. You will also see `console.log` messages and exceptions appearing in your terminal.

---

<WranglerCommand cmd="deploy" />

:::note

None of the options for this command are required. Also, many can be set in your `wrangler.toml` file. Refer to the [`wrangler.toml` configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) documentation for more information.

:::

---

<WranglerCommand cmd="delete" />

<Render file="wrangler-commands/kv" product="workers" />

---

## `r2 bucket`

Interact with buckets in an R2 store.

:::note

The `r2 bucket` commands allow you to manage application data in the Cloudflare network to be accessed from Workers using [the R2 API](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/).

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 bucket create" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 bucket delete" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 bucket list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 bucket notification create" />

## `r2 object`

Interact with R2 objects.

:::note

The `r2 object` commands allow you to manage application data in the Cloudflare network to be accessed from Workers using [the R2 API](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/).

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 object get" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 object put" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="r2 object delete" />

---

## `secret`

Manage the secret variables for a Worker.

This action creates a new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of the Worker and [deploys](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#deployments) it immediately. To only create a new version of the Worker, use the [`wrangler versions secret`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret-put) commands.

<WranglerCommand cmd="secret put" />

When running this command, you will be prompted to input the secret's value:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put FOO
```

```sh output
? Enter a secret value: › ***
🌀 Creating the secret for script worker-app
✨ Success! Uploaded secret FOO
```

The `put` command can also receive piped input. For example:

```sh
echo "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nM...==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n" | wrangler secret put PRIVATE_KEY
```

{/* <WranglerCommand cmd="secret delete" /> */}

<WranglerCommand cmd="secret list" />

The following is an example of listing the secrets for the current Worker.

```sh
npx wrangler secret list
```

```sh output
[
  {
    "name": "FOO",
    "type": "secret_text"
  }
]
```

---
<WranglerCommand cmd="secret bulk" />

The following is an example of uploading secrets from a JSON file redirected to `stdin`. When complete, the output summary will show the number of secrets uploaded and the number of secrets that failed to upload.

```json
{
	"secret-name-1": "secret-value-1",
	"secret-name-2": "secret-value-2"
}
```

```sh
npx wrangler secret:bulk < secrets.json
```

```sh output
🌀 Creating the secrets for the Worker "script-name"
✨ Successfully created secret for key: secret-name-1
...
🚨 Error uploading secret for key: secret-name-1
✨ Successfully created secret for key: secret-name-2

Finished processing secrets JSON file:
✨ 1 secrets successfully uploaded
🚨 1 secrets failed to upload
```

<WranglerCommand cmd="tail" />

After starting `wrangler tail`, you will receive a live feed of console and exception logs for each request your Worker receives.

If your Worker has a high volume of traffic, the tail might enter sampling mode. This will cause some of your messages to be dropped and a warning to appear in your tail logs. To prevent messages from being dropped, add the options listed above to filter the volume of tail messages.

:::note

It may take up to 1 minute (60 seconds) for a tail to exit sampling mode after adding an option to filter tail messages.
:::

If sampling persists after using options to filter messages, consider using [instant logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/instant-logs/).

---

## `pages`

Configure Cloudflare Pages.

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages dev" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages download config" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages project list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages project create" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages project delete" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages deployment list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages deployment tail" />

:::note

Filtering with `--ip self` will allow tailing your deployed Functions beyond the normal request per second limits.

:::

After starting `wrangler pages deployment tail`, you will receive a live stream of console and exception logs for each request your Functions receive.

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages deploy" />

:::note

Your site is deployed to `<PROJECT_NAME>.pages.dev`. If you do not provide the `--project-name` argument, you will be prompted to enter a project name in your terminal after you run the command.

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages secret put" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages secret delete" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages secret list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="pages secret bulk" />

---

## `queues`

Manage your Workers [Queues](/queues/) configurations.

<WranglerCommand cmd="queues create" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="queues delete" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="queues list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="queues consumer add" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="queues consumer remove" />

---

Authorize Wrangler with your Cloudflare account using OAuth. Wrangler will attempt to automatically open your web browser to login with your Cloudflare account.

If you prefer to use API tokens for authentication, such as in headless or continuous integration environments, refer to [Running Wrangler in CI/CD](/workers/ci-cd/).

<WranglerCommand cmd="login" />

:::note

`wrangler login` uses all the available scopes by default if no flags are provided.

:::

If Wrangler fails to open a browser, you can copy and paste the URL generated by `wrangler login` in your terminal into a browser and log in.

### Use `wrangler login` on a remote machine

If you are using Wrangler from a remote machine, but run the login flow from your local browser, you will receive the following error message after logging in:`This site can't be reached`.

To finish the login flow, run `wrangler login` and go through the login flow in the browser:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

```sh output
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.1.6
-------------------
Attempting to login via OAuth...
Opening a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/oauth2/auth?xyz...
```

The browser login flow will redirect you to a `localhost` URL on your machine.

Leave the login flow active. Open a second terminal session. In that second terminal session, use `curl` or an equivalent request library on the remote machine to fetch this `localhost` URL. Copy and paste the `localhost` URL that was generated during the `wrangler login` flow and run:

```sh
curl <LOCALHOST_URL>
```

---

<WranglerCommand cmd="logout" />

If you are using `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` instead of OAuth, and you can logout by deleting your API token in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **My Profile** > **API Tokens**.
3. Select the three-dot menu on your Wrangler token.
4. Select **Delete**.

---

<WranglerCommand cmd="whoami" />

---

## `versions`

:::note
The minimum required wrangler version to use these commands is 3.40.0. For versions before 3.73.0, you will need to add the `--x-versions` flag.
:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="versions upload" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="versions deploy" />

:::note

The non-interactive version of this prompt is: `wrangler versions deploy version-id-1@percentage-1% version-id-2@percentage-2 -y`

For example:
`wrangler versions deploy 095f00a7-23a7-43b7-a227-e4c97cab5f22@10%   1a88955c-2fbd-4a72-9d9b-3ba1e59842f2@90% -y`

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="versions list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="versions secret put" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="versions secret delete" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="versions secret bulk" />

---

## `triggers`

:::note

The minimum required wrangler version to use these commands is 3.40.0. For versions before 3.73.0, you will need to add the `--x-versions` flag.

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="triggers deploy" />

---

## `deployments`

[Deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#deployments) track the version(s) of your Worker that are actively serving traffic.

<WranglerCommand cmd="deployments list" />

:::note

The minimum required wrangler version to use these commands is 3.40.0. For versions before 3.73.0, you will need to add the `--x-versions` flag.

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="deployments status" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="rollback" />

:::caution

A rollback will immediately create a new deployment with the specified version of your Worker and become the active deployment across all your deployed routes and domains. This change will not affect work in your local development environment.

:::

---

## dispatch namespace

<WranglerCommand cmd="dispatch-namespace list" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="dispatch-namespace get" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="dispatch-namespace create" />

<WranglerCommand cmd="dispatch-namespace delete" />

:::note

You must delete all user Workers in the dispatch namespace before it can be deleted.

:::

<WranglerCommand cmd="dispatch-namespace rename" />

---

## `mtls-certificate`

Manage client certificates used for mTLS connections in subrequests.

These certificates can be used in [`mtls_certificate` bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/mtls), which allow a Worker to present the certificate when establishing a connection with an origin that requires client authentication (mTLS).

<WranglerCommand cmd="mtls-certificate upload" />

The following is an example of using the `upload` command to upload an mTLS certificate.

```sh
npx wrangler mtls-certificate upload --cert cert.pem --key key.pem --name my-origin-cert
```

```sh output
Uploading mTLS Certificate my-origin-cert...
Success! Uploaded mTLS Certificate my-origin-cert
ID: 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d
Issuer: CN=my-secured-origin.com,OU=my-team,O=my-org,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US
Expires: 1/01/2025
```

You can then add this certificate as a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
mtls_certificates = [
  { binding = "MY_CERT", certificate_id = "99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d" }
]
```

Note that the certificate and private keys must be in separate (typically `.pem`) files when uploading.

<WranglerCommand cmd="mtls-certificate list" />

The following is an example of using the `list` command to upload an mTLS certificate.

```sh
npx wrangler mtls-certificate list
```

```sh output
ID: 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d
Name: my-origin-cert
Issuer: CN=my-secured-origin.com,OU=my-team,O=my-org,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US
Created on: 1/01/2023
Expires: 1/01/2025

ID: c5d004d1-8312-402c-b8ed-6194328d5cbe
Issuer: CN=another-origin.com,OU=my-team,O=my-org,L=San Francisco,ST=California,C=US
Created on: 1/01/2023
Expires: 1/01/2025
```

<WranglerCommand cmd="mtls-certificate delete" />

The following is an example of using the `delete` command to delete an mTLS certificate.

```sh
npx wrangler mtls-certificate delete --id 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d
```

```sh output
Are you sure you want to delete certificate 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d (my-origin-cert)? [y/n]
yes
Deleting certificate 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d...
Deleted certificate 99f5fef1-6cc1-46b8-bd79-44a0d5082b8d successfully
```

---

<WranglerCommand cmd="types" />

:::note

The `--experimental-include-runtime` flag dynamically generates runtime types according to the `compatibility_date` and `compatibility_flags` defined in your [config file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

It is a replacement for the [`@cloudflare/workers-types` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types), so that package, if installed, should be uninstalled to avoid any potential conflict.

After running the command, you must add the path of the generated runtime types file to the [`compilerOptions.types` field](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#types) in your project's [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) file.

You may use the shorthand `--x-include-runtime` flag in place of `--experimental-include-runtime` anywhere it is mentioned.

The minimum required Wrangler version to use this command is 3.66.0.

:::
