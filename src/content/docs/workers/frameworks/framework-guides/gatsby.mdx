In this guide, you will create a new [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [<InlineBadge preset="beta" /> Workers Assets](/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1. Set up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Gatsby's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Gatsby project with <InlineBadge preset="beta" /> Workers Assets, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest my-gatsby-app"
	args={"--framework=gatsby --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "web-framework",
		framework: "Gatsby",
	}}
/>

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-gatsby-app
```

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"dev"} />

## 3. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including Cloudflare's own.

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

## Static assets

You can serve static assets your Gatsby application by placing them in [the `./static/` directory](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/static-folder/). This can be useful for resource files such as images, stylesheets, fonts, and manifests.
