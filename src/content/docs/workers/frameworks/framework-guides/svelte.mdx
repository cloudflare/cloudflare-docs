} from "~/components";

In this guide, you will create a new [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [<InlineBadge preset="beta" /> Workers Assets](/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1. Set up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Svelte's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Svelte project with <InlineBadge preset="beta" /> Workers Assets, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest my-svelte-app"
	args={"--framework=svelte --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "web-framework",
		framework: "Svelte",
	}}
/>

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-svelte-app
```

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"dev"} />

## 3. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

## Bindings

Your Svelte application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, in both local development and in production, by using product bindings. The [Svelte documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-cloudflare#runtime-apis) provides information about configuring bindings and how you can access them in your Svelte hooks and endpoints.

## Static assets

You can serve static assets your Svelte application by placing them in [the `./static/` directory](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure#project-files-static). This can be useful for resource files such as images, stylesheets, fonts, and manifests.

<Render file="workers-assets-routing-summary" />
