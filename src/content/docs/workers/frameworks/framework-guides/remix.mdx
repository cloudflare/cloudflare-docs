In this guide, you will create a new [Remix](https://remix.run/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [<InlineBadge preset="beta" /> Workers Assets](/workers/configuration/assets/)).

## 1. Set up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Remix's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Remix project with <InlineBadge preset="beta" /> Workers Assets, run the following command:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest my-remix-app"
	args={"--framework=remix --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "web-framework",
		framework: "Remix",
	}}
/>

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-remix-app
```

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"dev"} />

## 3. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including Cloudflare's own.

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

<PackageManagers type="run" args={"deploy"} />

## Bindings

Your Remix application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, in both local development and in production, by using product bindings. The [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite#bindings) provides information about configuring bindings and how you can access them in your Remix page loaders.

## Static assets

You can serve static assets your Remix application by placing them in the `./public/` directory. This can be useful for resource files such as images, stylesheets, fonts, and manifests.
