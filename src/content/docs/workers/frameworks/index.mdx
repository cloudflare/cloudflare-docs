### What you can build

<Feature header="Static Websites" href="/workers/frameworks/get-started/#deploying-a-static-site" cta="Deploy a static site">

Deploy static sites like blogs, portfolios, or documentation pages. Serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files directly from Cloudflare's network for low-latency access worldwide.

</Feature>

<Feature header="Full-stack Applications" href="/workers/frameworks/get-started/#deploying-a-dynamic-site" cta="Deploy a full-stack application">

Build dynamic and interactive server-side rendered (SSR) applications on Cloudflare Workers.

Combine asset hosting with Cloudflare's data and storage products such as [Workers KV](/kv/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), and [R2 Storage](/r2/) to build full-stack applications. Manage both frontend and backend logic on Cloudflare's Developer Platform.
