## `MockTracker`

The `MockTracker` API in Node.js provides a means of tracking and managing mock objects in a test
environment.

```js
import { mock } from 'node:test';

const fn = mock.fn();
fn(1,2,3);  // does nothing... but

console.log(fn.mock.callCount());  // Records how many times it was called
console.log(fn.mock.calls[0].arguments));  // Recoreds the arguments that were passed each call
```

The full `MockTracker` API is documented in the [Node.js documentation for `MockTracker`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/test.html#class-mocktracker).

The Workers implementation of `MockTracker` currently does not include an implementation of the [Node.js mock timers API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/test.html#class-mocktimers).
