description: Node.js APIs available in Cloudflare Workers

import { DirectoryListing } from "~/components";

When you write a Worker, you may need to import packages from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Many npm packages rely on APIs from the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/about), and will not work unless these Node.js APIs are available.

Cloudflare Workers provides a subset of Node.js APIs in two forms:

1. As built-in APIs provided by the Workers Runtime
2. As polyfills that [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) adds to your Worker's code

You can view which APIs are supported using the [Node.js compatability matrix](https://workers-nodejs-compat-matrix.pages.dev).

## Get Started

To enable both built-in runtime APIs and polyfills for your Worker, add the [`nodejs_compat`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) [compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) to your `wrangler.toml`, and set your compatibility date to September 23rd, 2024 or later.

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
```

:::note
As of September 23rd, 2024, the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag enables the exact same behavior as the `nodejs_compat_v2` compatibility flag, as long as your compatibility date is set to September 23rd, 2024 or later.

## Built-in Node.js Runtime APIs

The following APIs from Node.js are provided directly by the Workers Runtime when either `nodejs_compat` or `nodejs_compat_v2` are enabled:

Unless otherwise specified, implementations of Node.js APIs in Workers are intended to match the implementation in the [Current release of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

## Node.js API Polyfills

When you enable the `nodejs_compat` compatability flag and set your compatibility date to `2024-09-23` or later, in addition to enabling Node.js APIs in the Workers Runtime, [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) will use [unenv](https://github.com/unjs/unenv) to automatically detect uses of Node.js APIs, and add polyfills where relevant.

Adding polyfills maximizes compatibility with existing npm packages, while recognizing that not all APIs from Node.js make sense in the context of serverless functions.

Where it is possible to provide a fully functional polyfill of the relevant Node.js API, unenv will do so.
In cases where this is not possible, such as the [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html), unenv adds a module with mocked methods.
Calling these mocked methods will either noop or will throw an error with a message like:

```
[unenv] <method name> is not implemented yet!
```

This allows you to import packages that use these Node.js modules, even if certain methods are not supported.

For a full list of APIs supported, including information on which are mocked, see the [Node.js compatability matrix](https://workers-nodejs-compat-matrix.pages.dev).

If an API you wish to use is missing and you want to suggest that Workers support it, please add a post or comment in the
[Node.js APIs discussions category](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/discussions/categories/node-js-apis) on GitHub.

## Enable only AsyncLocalStorage

To enable only the Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` API, use the `nodejs_als` compatibility flag.

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_als" ]
```
