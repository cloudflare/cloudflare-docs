description: Configure your Worker to present a client certificate to services
  that enforce an mTLS connection.

import { TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components"

When using [HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/), a server presents a certificate for the client to authenticate in order to prove their identity. For even tighter security, some services require that the client also present a certificate.

This process - known as [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) - moves authentication to the protocol of TLS, rather than managing it in application code. Connections from unauthorized clients are rejected during the TLS handshake instead.

To present a client certificate when communicating with a service, create a mTLS certificate [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your Worker project's `wrangler.toml` file. This will allow your Worker to present a client certificate to a service on your behalf.

:::caution


Currently, mTLS for Workers cannot be used for requests made to a service that is a [proxied zone](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) on Cloudflare. If your Worker presents a client certificate to a service proxied by Cloudflare, Cloudflare will return a `520` error.


:::

First, upload a certificate and its private key to your account using the [`wrangler mtls-certificate`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#mtls-certificate) command:

:::caution


The `wrangler mtls-certificate upload` command requires the [SSL and Certificates Edit API token scope](/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/). If you are using the OAuth flow triggered by  `wrangler login`, the correct scope is set automatically. If you are using API tokens, refer to [Create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) to set the right scope for your API token. 
:::

```sh
$ npx wrangler mtls-certificate upload --cert cert.pem --key key.pem --name my-client-cert
```

Then, update your Worker project's `wrangler.toml` file to create an mTLS certificate binding:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
mtls_certificates = [
  { binding = "MY_CERT", certificate_id = "<CERTIFICATE_ID>" }
]
```

:::note

Certificate IDs are displayed after uploading, and can also be viewed with the command `wrangler mtls-certificate list`. 
:::

Adding an mTLS certificate binding includes a variable in the Worker's environment on which the `fetch()` method is available. This `fetch()` method uses the standard [Fetch](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) API and has the exact same signature as the global `fetch`, but always presents the client certificate when establishing the TLS connection.

:::note

mTLS certificate bindings present an API similar to [service bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings).
