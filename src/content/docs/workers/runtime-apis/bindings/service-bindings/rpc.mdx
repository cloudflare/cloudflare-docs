import { DirectoryListing, Render } from "~/components";

[Service bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings) allow one Worker to call into another, without going through a publicly-accessible URL.

You can use Service bindings to create your own internal APIs that your Worker makes available to other Workers. This can be done by extending the built-in `WorkerEntrypoint` class, and adding your own public methods. These public methods can then be directly called by other Workers on your Cloudflare account that declare a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) to this Worker.

The [RPC system in Workers](/workers/runtime-apis/rpc) is designed feel as similar as possible to calling a JavaScript function in the same Worker. In most cases, you should be able to write code in the same way you would if everything was in a single Worker.

:::note

You can also use RPC to communicate between Workers and [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/best-practices/create-durable-object-stubs-and-send-requests/#call-rpc-methods).
:::

## Example

For example, the following Worker implements the public method `add(a, b)`:

<Render file="service-binding-rpc-example" product="workers" />

You do not need to learn, implement, or think about special protocols to use the RPC system. The client, in this case Worker A, calls Worker B and tells it to execute a specific procedure using specific arguments that the client provides. This is accomplished with standard JavaScript classes.

## The `WorkerEntrypoint` Class

To provide RPC methods from your Worker, you must extend the `WorkerEntrypoint` class, as shown in the example below:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	async add(a, b) {
		return a + b;
	}
}
```

A new instance of the class is created every time the Worker is called. Note that even though the Worker is implemented as a class, it is still stateless — the class instance only lasts for the duration of the invocation. If you need to persist or coordinate state in Workers, you should use [Durable Objects](/durable-objects).

### Bindings (`env`)

The [`env`](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) object is exposed as a class property of the `WorkerEntrypoint` class.

For example, a Worker that declares a binding to the [environment variable](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) `GREETING`:

import { WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "my-worker"

[vars]
GREETING = "Hello"
```

</WranglerConfig>

Can access it by calling `this.env.GREETING`:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	fetch() {
		return new Response("Hello from my-worker");
	}

	async greet(name) {
		return this.env.GREETING + name;
	}
}
```

You can use any type of [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) this way.

### Lifecycle methods (`ctx`)

The [`ctx`](/workers/runtime-apis/context) object is exposed as a class property of the `WorkerEntrypoint` class.

For example, you can extend the lifetime of the invocation context by calling the `waitUntil()` method:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	fetch() {
		return new Response("Hello from my-worker");
	}

	async signup(email, name) {
		// sendEvent() will continue running, even after this method returns a value to the caller
		this.ctx.waitUntil(this.#sendEvent("signup", email));
		// Perform any other work
		return "Success";
	}

	async #sendEvent(eventName, email) {
		//...
	}
}
```

## Named entrypoints

You can also export any number of named `WorkerEntrypoint` classes from within a single Worker, in addition to the default export. You can then declare a Service binding to a specific named entrypoint.

You can use this to group multiple pieces of compute together. For example, you might create a distinct `WorkerEntrypoint` for each permission role in your application, and use these to provide role-specific RPC methods:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "todo-app"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "D1"
database_name = "todo-app-db"
database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
```

</WranglerConfig>

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class AdminEntrypoint extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	async createUser(username) {
		await this.env.D1.prepare("INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES (?)")
			.bind(username)
			.run();
	}

	async deleteUser(username) {
		await this.env.D1.prepare("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = ?")
			.bind(username)
			.run();
	}
}

export class UserEntrypoint extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	async getTasks(userId) {
		return await this.env.D1.prepare(
			"SELECT title FROM tasks WHERE user_id = ?",
		)
			.bind(userId)
			.all();
	}

	async createTask(userId, title) {
		await this.env.D1.prepare(
			"INSERT INTO tasks (user_id, title) VALUES (?, ?)",
		)
			.bind(userId, title)
			.run();
	}
}

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		return new Response("Hello from my to do app");
	}
}
```

You can then declare a Service binding directly to `AdminEntrypoint` in another Worker:

<WranglerConfig>

```toml
name = "admin-app"

[[services]]
binding = "ADMIN"
service = "todo-app"
entrypoint = "AdminEntrypoint"
```

</WranglerConfig>

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		await env.ADMIN.createUser("aNewUser");
		return new Response("Hello from admin app");
	},
};
```

You can learn more about how to configure D1 in the [D1 documentation](/d1/get-started/#3-bind-your-worker-to-your-d1-database).

You can try out a complete example of this to do app, as well as a Discord bot built with named entrypoints, by cloning the [cloudflare/js-rpc-and-entrypoints-demo repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/js-rpc-and-entrypoints-demo) from GitHub.
