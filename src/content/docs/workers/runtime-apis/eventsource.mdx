## Background

The [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) interface is a server-sent event API that allows a server to push events to a client. The `EventSource` object is used to receive server-sent events. It connects to a server over HTTP and receives events in a text-based format.

### Constructor

```js
let eventSource = new EventSource(url, options);
```



* `url` USVString - The URL to which to connect.
* `options` EventSourceInit - An optional dictionary containing any optional settings.



By default, the `EventSource` will use the global `fetch()` function under the
covers to make requests. If you need to use a different fetch implementation as
provided by a Cloudflare Workers binding, you can pass the `fetcher` option:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(req, env) {
    let eventSource = new EventSource(url, { fetcher: env.MYFETCHER });
    // ...
  }
};
```

Note that the `fetcher` option is a Cloudflare Workers specific extension.

### Properties



* `eventSource.url` USVString read-only
  * The URL of the event source.
* `eventSource.readyState` USVString read-only
  * The state of the connection.
* `eventSource.withCredentials` Boolean read-only
  * A Boolean indicating whether the `EventSource` object was instantiated with cross-origin (CORS) credentials set (`true`), or not (`false`).



### Methods



* `eventSource.close()`
  * Closes the connection.
* `eventSource.onopen`
  * An event handler called when a connection is opened.
* `eventSource.onmessage`
  * An event handler called when a message is received.
* `eventSource.onerror`
  * An event handler called when an error occurs.



### Events



* `message`
  * Fired when a message is received.
* `open`
  * Fired when the connection is opened.
* `error`
  * Fired when an error occurs.



### Class Methods



* <code>EventSource.from(readableStreamReadableStream) : EventSource</code>
  * This is a Cloudflare Workers specific extension that creates a new `EventSource` object from an existing `ReadableStream`. Such an instance does not initiate a new connection but instead attaches to the provided stream.
