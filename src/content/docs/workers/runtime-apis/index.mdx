The Workers runtime is designed to be [JavaScript standards compliant](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) and web-interoperable. Wherever possible, it uses web platform APIs, so that code can be reused across client and server, as well as across [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/) JavaScript runtimes.

[Workers runtime features](/workers/runtime-apis/) are [compatible with a subset of Node.js APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs) and the ability to set a [compatibility date or compatibility flag](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/).
