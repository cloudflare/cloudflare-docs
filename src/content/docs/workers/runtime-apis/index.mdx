The Workers runtime is designed to be [JavaScript standards compliant](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) and web-interoperable. Wherever possible, it uses web platform APIs, so that code can be reused across client and server, as well as across [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/) JavaScript runtimes.

The Workers runtime also implements [a subset of Node.js APIs](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) as an optional, opt-in compatibility layer.
