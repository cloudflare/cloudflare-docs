title: Fetch Handler

---

## Background

Incoming HTTP requests to a Worker are passed to the `fetch()` handler as a [`Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) object. To respond to the request with a response, return a [`Response`](/workers/runtime-apis/response/) object:

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		return new Response('Hello World!');
	},
};
```

:::note


The Workers runtime does not support `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR). Learn the difference between `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch()` in the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) documentation.

  * Refer to [`waitUntil`](/workers/runtime-apis/context/#waituntil).

* <code>ctx.passThroughOnException()</code> : void
