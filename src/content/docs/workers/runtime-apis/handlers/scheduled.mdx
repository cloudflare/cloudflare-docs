title: Scheduled Handler
---

## Background

When a Worker is invoked via a [Cron Trigger](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/), the `scheduled()` handler handles the invocation.

:::note[Testing scheduled() handlers in local development]

You can test the behavior of your `scheduled()` handler in local development using Wrangler.

Cron Triggers can be tested using `Wrangler` by passing in the `--test-scheduled` flag to [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev). This will expose a `/__scheduled` route which can be used to test using a http request. To simulate different cron patterns, a `cron` query parameter can be passed in.

```sh
npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled

curl "http://localhost:8787/__scheduled?cron=*+*+*+*+*"
```

## Syntax

```js
export default {
	async scheduled(event, env, ctx) {
		ctx.waitUntil(doSomeTaskOnASchedule());
	},
};
```

### Properties

- `event.cron` string

  - The value of the [Cron Trigger](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/) that started the `ScheduledEvent`.

- `event.type` string

  - The type of event. This will always return `"scheduled"`.

- `event.scheduledTime` number

  - The time the `ScheduledEvent` was scheduled to be executed in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, UTC. It can be parsed as <code>new Date(event.scheduledTime)</code>.

- `env` object

  - An object containing the bindings associated with your Worker using ES modules format, such as KV namespaces and Durable Objects.

- `ctx` object
  - An object containing the context associated with your Worker using ES modules format. Currently, this object just contains the `waitUntil` function.

### Methods

When a Workers script is invoked by a [Cron Trigger](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/), the Workers runtime starts a `ScheduledEvent` which will be handled by the `scheduled` function in your Workers Module class. The `ctx` argument represents the context your function runs in, and contains the following methods to control what happens next:

- <code>ctx.waitUntil(promisePromise)</code> : void

  - Use this method to notify the runtime to wait for asynchronous tasks (for example, logging, analytics to third-party services, streaming and caching). The first `ctx.waitUntil` to fail will be observed and recorded as the status in the [Cron Trigger](/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/) Past Events table. Otherwise, it will be reported as a success.
