## Background

`BYOB` is an abbreviation of bring your own buffer. A `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` allows reading into a developer-supplied buffer, thus minimizing copies.

An instance of `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` is functionally identical to [`ReadableStreamDefaultReader`](/workers/runtime-apis/streams/readablestreamdefaultreader/) with the exception of the `read` method.

A `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` is not instantiated via its constructor. Rather, it is retrieved from a [`ReadableStream`](/workers/runtime-apis/streams/readablestream/):

```js
const { readable, writable } = new TransformStream();
const reader = readable.getReader({ mode: 'byob' });
```

## Methods



* <code>read(bufferArrayBufferView)</code> : Promise\<ReadableStreamBYOBReadResult>

  * Returns a promise with the next available chunk of data read into a passed-in buffer.

* <code>readAtLeast(minBytes, bufferArrayBufferView)</code> : Promise\<ReadableStreamBYOBReadResult>

  * Returns a promise with the next available chunk of data read into a passed-in buffer. The promise will not resolve until at least `minBytes` have been read.

## Common issues

:::caution[Warning]


`read` provides no control over the minimum number of bytes that should be read into the buffer. Even if you allocate a 1 MiB buffer, the kernel is perfectly within its rights to fulfill this read with a single byte, whether or not an EOF immediately follows.

In practice, the Workers team has found that `read` typically fills only 1% of the provided buffer.

`readAtLeast` is a non-standard extension to the Streams API which allows users to specify that at least `minBytes` bytes must be read into the buffer before resolving the read.
