For most frontend applications, you'll want to use a framework. Workers supports number of popular [frameworks](/workers/frameworks/) that come with ready-to-use components, a pre-defined structured architecture, and community support. View [framework specific guides](/workers/frameworks/) to get started using a framework.

Alternativley, you may prefer to build your website from scratch if:

- You're interested in learning by implementing core functionalities on your own.
- You're working on a simple project where you might not need a framework.
- You want to optimize for performance by minimizing external dependencies.
- You require complete control over every aspect of the application.
- You want to build your own framework.

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a static site or a full-stack application without a framework on Workers.

## Deploy a static site

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a static site on Workers.

### 1. Create a new Worker project using the CLI

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare. Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-static-site --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World - Assets-only",
		lang: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

### 3. Deploy your project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Deploy a full-stack application

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying dynamic and interactive server-side rendered (SSR) applications on Cloudflare Workers.

When building a full-stack application, you can use any [Workers bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) to interact with resources on the Cloudflare developer platform.

### 1. Create a new Worker project

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-dynamic-site --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		category: "hello-world",
		type: "Hello World - Worker with Assets",
		lang: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

### 3. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```
