Configuring a project with assets requires specifying a [directory](/workers/configuration/assets/#directory) or an [assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/) in the project's `wrangler.toml` file. Only one assets directory/binding can be configured for each project.

## Directory

Root folder of static assets to be served. For static site only projects. For many frameworks, this is the `./public` or `./dist` folder.

```sh title="wrangler.toml"
name = "my-worker"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-19"
assets = { directory = "./public"}
```

## Binding

The assets binding is used in full-stack applications. The [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) gives you access to the directory of assets from within a Worker.

```sh title="wrangler.toml"
name = "my-worker"
main = "src/index.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-19"

assets = { directory = "./public", binding = "ASSETS" }
```

### Runtime API Reference

#### `fetch()`

**Parameters**

- `request: Request` Pass a [Request object](/workers/runtime-apis/request/), URL string, or URL object.Requests made through this method have `html_handling` and `not_found_handling` configuration applied to them.

**Response**

- `Promise<Response>` Returns a static asset matching the given request.

**Example**

Your dynamic code can make or forward requests to your project's static assets using the assets binding.

Take the following example that configures a Worker to return a response under all requests headed for `/api/`. Otherwise, the Worker will fallback to returning static assets.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">

```js
export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const url = new URL(request.url);
		if (url.pathname.startsWith("/api/")) {
			// TODO: Add your custom /api/* logic here.
			return new Response("Ok");
		}
		// Otherwise, serve the static assets.
		// Without this, the Worker will error and no assets will be served.
		return env.ASSETS.fetch(request);
	},
};
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">

```ts
interface Env {
	ASSETS: Fetcher;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
		const url = new URL(request.url);
		if (url.pathname.startsWith("/api/")) {
			// TODO: Add your custom /api/* logic here.
			return new Response("Ok");
		}
		// Otherwise, serve the static assets.
		// Without this, the Worker will error and no assets will be served.
		return env.ASSETS.fetch(request);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

:::caution
The following methods are experimental and subject to change.
:::

#### `unstable_exists()`

**Parameters**:

- `pathname: string` URL path. Requests made through this method are treated as "raw access" as they do not have `html_handling` and `not_found_handling` configuration applied to them.

**Response**:

- `Promise<string | null` Returns a promise of an etag for a specific assets.

#### `unstable_exists()`

**Parameters**:

- `eTag: string` eTag returned for an asset.

**Response**:

- `Promise<{ readableStream: ReadableStream; contentType: string }>` Returns a ReadableStream of data and contentType for a specific assets. Can be used to construct a response object.

#### `unstable_getByPathName()`

**Parameters**:

- `pathname: string` URL path. Requests made through this method are treated as "raw access" as they do not have `html_handling` and `not_found_handling` configuration applied to them.

**Response**:

- `Promise<{ readableStream: ReadableStream; contentType: string }>` Returns a ReadableStream of data and contentType for a specific assets. Can be used to construct a response object.
