Configuring a Worker with assets requires specifying a [directory](/workers/static-assets/binding/#directory) and, optionally, an [assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/), in your Worker's `wrangler.toml` file. The [assets binding](/workers/static-assets/binding/) allows you to dynamically fetch assets from within your Worker script (e.g. `env.ASSETS.fetch()`), similarly to how you might with a make a `fetch()` call with a [Service binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/http/).

Only one collection of static assets can be configured in each Worker.

## `directory`

The folder of static assets to be served. For many frameworks, this is the `./public/`, `./dist/`, or `./build/` folder.

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "my-worker"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-19"
assets = { directory = "./public/" }
```

## `binding`

Configuring the optional [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) gives you access to the collection of assets from within your Worker script.

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "my-worker"
main = "./src/index.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-19"

assets = { directory = "./public/", binding = "ASSETS" }
```

In the example above, assets would be available through `env.ASSETS`.

### Runtime API Reference

#### `fetch()`

**Parameters**

- `request: Request` Pass a [Request object](/workers/runtime-apis/request/), URL string, or URL object. Requests made through this method have `html_handling` and `not_found_handling` configuration applied to them.

**Response**

- `Promise<Response>` Returns a static asset response for the given request.

**Example**

Your dynamic code can make new, or forward incoming, requests to your project's static assets using the assets binding.

Take the following example that configures a Worker script to return a response under all requests headed for `/api/`. Otherwise, the Worker script will pass the incoming request through to the asset binding. In this case, because a Worker script is only invoked when the requested route has not matched any static assets, this will always evaluate [`not_found_handling`](/workers/static-assets/routing/#routing-configuration) behavior.

			return new Response("Ok");
		}
		// Passes the incoming request through to the assets binding.

		return env.ASSETS.fetch(request);

		if (url.pathname.startsWith("/api/")) {
			// TODO: Add your custom /api/* logic here.
			return new Response("Ok");
		}
		// Passes the incoming request through to the assets binding.
		// No asset matched this request, so this will evaluate `not_found_handling` behavior.
		return env.ASSETS.fetch(request);
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
