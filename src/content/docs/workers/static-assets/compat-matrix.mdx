Cloudflare [Workers with static assets](/workers/static-assets/) and [Pages](/pages/) both have the ability to host frontend applications. The following compatibility matrix shows the features are available for each product to help you when choosing which product to start with.

We plan to bridge the gaps between Workers and Pages and provide ways to migrate your Pages projects to Workers.

<sup>1</sup> Recommend using a Worker infront of the Worker with assets to run
middleware, connected through a [service
binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/).
<sup>2</sup> Redirects can be handled in a Worker or using [bulk
redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/#_top)(only available if your
Worker is running on a [route or custom
domain](/workers/configuration/routing/)).
<sup>3</sup> Cannot be enabled right now. Actively working on removing this
limitation.
