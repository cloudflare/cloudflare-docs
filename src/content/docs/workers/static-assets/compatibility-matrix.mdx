Cloudflare [Workers with static assets](/workers/static-assets/) and [Pages](/pages/) both have the ability to host front-end and full-stack applications. The following compatibility matrix shows the features are available for each product to help you when choosing which product to start with.

We plan to bridge the gaps between Workers and Pages and provide ways to migrate your Pages projects to Workers.

<sup>1</sup> If you need to run a Worker script ahead of serving static assets,
we currently recommend using [Service
bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) to connect a Worker
in front of the Worker with assets. We plan to explore additional configuration
to support more complex routing in the future.

<sup>2</sup> You can handle redirects by adding code to your Worker (a
[community package](https://npmjs.com/package/redirects-in-workers) is available
for `_redirects` support), or you can use [Bulk
Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/).

<sup>3</sup> You cannot yet enable [Smart
Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) projects with static assets.
This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.

<sup>4</sup> You cannot yet add a [Tail
Worker](/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/) to a project with assets.
This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.

<sup>5</sup> You can use Durable Objects if deployed from a normal Worker. You
will need to specify the Worker which deploys the Durable Object.
