Cloudflare [Workers with static assets](/workers/static-assets/) and [Pages](/pages/) both have the ability to host frontend applications. The following compatibility matrix shows the features are available for each product to help you when choosing which product to start with.

We plan to bridge the gaps between Workers and Pages and provide ways to migrate your Pages projects to Workers.

<sup>1</sup> We recommend using [service
bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) to connect a Worker
in front of the Worker with assets to run middleware. <br />
<sup>2</sup> You can handle redirects by adding code to your Worker, or use
[bulk redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/#_top) (only available if
your Worker is running on a [route or custom
domain](/workers/configuration/routing/)). <br />
<sup>3</sup> You cannot yet enable [Smart
Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) projects with static assets.
This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it. <br />
<sup>4</sup> You cannot yet add a [Tail
Worker](/workers/observability/logging/tail-workers/) to a project with assets.
This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
