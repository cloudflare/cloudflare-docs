## What you can build

### Static Websites

Deploy static sites like blogs, portfolios, or documentation pages. Serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files directly from Cloudflare's network for low-latency access worldwide.

</LinkButton>

### Full-stack Applicatoins

Build dynamic and interactive server-side rendered (SSR) applications on Cloudflare Workers.

Combine asset hosting with Cloudflare's data and storage products such as [Workers KV](/kv/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), and [R2 Storage](/r2/) to build full-stack applications. Manage both frontend and backend logic on Cloudflare's Developer Platform.

### Pricing

Requests to static assets are free and unlimited. Refer to [pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#example-2) for an example.

### Limitations

The following limitations apply for Workers with static assets:

- You cannot yet enable [Smart Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) projects with static assets. This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- You cannot upload static assets to [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) [user workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/). This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- In local development, you cannot make [Service Binding RPC calls](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/rpc/) to a Worker with static assets. This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- Workers with assets cannot run on a [route or domain](/workers/configuration/routing/) with a path. Eg. `example.com` is an acceptable route but `example.com/foo` is not. The Worker will throw an error when you try and add the route with a path.
- The [Vitest Integration](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/) does not currently handle static assets. All requests will reach your Worker, which can otherwise be tested as usual. This is a temporary limitation - we are working to remove it.
