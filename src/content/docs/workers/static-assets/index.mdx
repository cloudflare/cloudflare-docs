### What you can build

<Feature header="Static Websites" href="/workers/frameworks/get-started/#deploying-a-static-site" cta="Deploy a static site">

Deploy static sites like blogs, portfolios, or documentation pages. Serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files directly from Cloudflare's network for low-latency access worldwide.

</Feature>

<Feature header="Full-stack Applications" href="/workers/frameworks/get-started/#deploying-a-dynamic-site" cta="Deploy a full-stack application">

Build dynamic and interactive server-side rendered (SSR) applications on Cloudflare Workers.

Combine asset hosting with Cloudflare's data and storage products such as [Workers KV](/kv/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), and [R2 Storage](/r2/) to build full-stack applications. Manage both frontend and backend logic on Cloudflare's Developer Platform.

</Feature>

### Pricing

Requests to static assets are free and unlimited. Refer to [pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#example-2) for an example.

### Limitations

The following limitations apply for Workers with assets:

- [Smart Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) cannot be enabled for projects with Assets. We are actively working on removing this limitation.
- Assets cannot be uploaded to [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) [user workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/). We are working on removing this limitation during the beta period.
- [RPC](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/rpc/) communication between service bindings are not supported in `wrangler dev` for Workers with assets. We are working on removing this limitation during the beta period.
- Workers with assets cannot run on a [route or domain](/workers/configuration/routing/) with a path. Eg. `example.com` is an acceptable route but `example.com/foo` is not and will throw an error.
