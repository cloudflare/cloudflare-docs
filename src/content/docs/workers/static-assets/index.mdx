## What you can build

### Static Websites

Deploy static sites like blogs, portfolios, or documentation pages. Serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files directly from Cloudflare's network for low-latency access worldwide.

</LinkButton>

### Full-stack Applications

Build dynamic and interactive server-side rendered (SSR) applications on Cloudflare Workers.

You can combine asset hosting with Cloudflare's data and storage products such as [Workers KV](/kv/), [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/), and [R2 Storage](/r2/) to build full-stack applications that serve both front-end and back-end logic in a single Worker.

### Supported frameworks

The following Frameworks are currently supported on Cloudflare Workers:

<DirectoryListing folder="workers/frameworks/framework-guides" />

:::note

Static Assets for Workers is currently in open beta. If you're looking for a framework not on this list, it may be supported in [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/). Visit [Pages Frameworks guides](/pages/framework-guides/) for a full list.

### Pricing

Requests to a project with static assets can either return static assets or invoke the Worker script, depending on if the request [matches a static asset or not](/workers/static-assets/routing/).

**Requests to static assets are free and unlimited**. Requests to the Worker script (e.g. in the case of SSR content) are billed according to Workers pricing. Refer to [pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#example-2) for an example.

### Troubleshooting

- `assets.bucket is a required field` — if you see this error, you need to update Wrangler to at least `3.78.10` or later. `bucket` is not a required field.

### Limitations

The following limitations apply for Workers with static assets:

- You cannot yet enable [Smart Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) projects with static assets. This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- You cannot upload static assets to [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) [user workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/). This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- In local development, you cannot make [Service Binding RPC calls](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/rpc/) to a Worker with static assets. This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
- Workers with assets cannot run on a [route or domain](/workers/configuration/routing/) with a path component. For example, `example.com/*` is an acceptable route, but `example.com/foo/*` is not. Wrangler and the Cloudflare dashboard will throw an error when you try and add a route with a path component.
