You can set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for your Workers by using either the native build system, [Workers Builds](#workers-builds), or using [external providers](#external-cicd) to optimize your development workflow.

## Why use CI/CD?

It is best practice to deploy your Workers with a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process. A CI/CD pipeline offers several advantages:

- Streamlines the build and deployment process, eliminating the need for manual adhoc `wrangler deploy` commands
- Ensures your Worker is always built and deployed in a uniform environment, reducing variability and potential errors
- Simplifies managing access to production credentials

## Which CI/CD should I use?

Choose [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds) if you want a fully integrated solution within Cloudflare's ecosystem that requires minimal setup and configuration for GitHub or GitLab users.

We recommend using [external CI/CD providers](/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd) if:

- You have a self-hosted instance of GitHub or GitLabs, which is currently not supported in Workers Builds' git integration
- You are using a git provider that is not GitHub or GitLab

## Workers Builds

[Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds) is Cloudflare's native CI/CD system that allows you to integrate with GitHub or GitLab, and automatically deploy your changes with each new commit.

## External CI/CD

You can also choose to set up your CI/CD pipeline with an external provider.
