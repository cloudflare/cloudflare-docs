Deploying Cloudflare Workers with CI/CD ensures reliable, automated deployments for every code change.

If you prefer to use your existing CI/CD provider instead of [Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/), this section offers guides for popular providers:

- [**GitHub Actions**](/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/)
- [**GitLab Pipelines**](/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/gitlab-pipelines/)

Other CI/CD options including but not limited to Terraform, CircleCI, Jenkins, and more, can also be used to deploy Workers following a similar set up process.
