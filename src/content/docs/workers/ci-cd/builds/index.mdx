Workers Builds allows you to connect an existing Worker to a GitHub or GitLab repository to set up automatic builds and deployments for your development workflow. Creating a new Worker from a git repository will be supported soon.

## Get Started

To set up your Git integration with Workers:

1. **Select your Worker** in the [Workers & Pages dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and navigate to **Settings > Build**
2. **Select the Git provider** you'd like to connect to by clicking "Connect". Follow the prompts to install the Cloudflare application on your git account.
3. **Configure your build settings** by selecting your desired git repository, branch, and [configuring](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/) a deploy command and optionally a build command.
4. **Push a commit** to your git repository to trigger your first build and deploy.

## View Build Details

Once a build is in-progress, you can monitor its build logs and view build history by navigating to **View build history** at the bottom of the deployments tab of your Worker.

If the build is successful, you can also view the build details by selecting **View build** in the associated new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/) created under **Version History**.
