Workers Builds uses a build image with support for a variety of languages and tools such as Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Go.

## Supported languages and tools

In the following table, review the preinstalled versions for languages and tools included in the Cloudflare Workers' build image, and the environment variables and/or files available for [overriding the preinstalled version](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-image/#overriding-default-versions):

| Tool        | Default version  | Environment variable | File                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Go**      | 1.22.0           | `GO_VERSION`         |                              |
| **Node.js** | 22               | `NODE_VERSION`       | .nvmrc, .node-version        |
| **Python**  | 3.12.5           | `PYTHON_VERSION`     | .python-version, runtime.txt |
| **Ruby**    | 3.3.4            | `RUBY_VERSION`       | .ruby-version                |
| **Bun**     | 1.1.22           | `BUN_VERSION`        |                              |
| **Hugo**    | extended_0.130.0 | `HUGO_VERSION`       |                              |

The default versions will be updated regularly to the latest minor version. No major version updates will be made without notice. If you need a specific minor version, please specify it by overriding the default version.

### Overriding default versions

If you need to override a [specific version](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-image/#overriding-default-versions) of a language or tool within the image, you can specify it as a [build environment variable](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-configuration/#build-settings), or set the relevant file in your source code as shown above.

To set the version using a build environment variables, you can:

1. Find the environment variable name for the language or tool and desired version (e.g. `NODE_VERSION = 22`)
2. Add and save the environment variable on the dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Build** > **Build Variables and Secrets* in your Workers project

Or, to set the version by adding a file to your project, you can:

1. Find the filename for the language or tool (e.g. `.nvmrc`)
2. Add the specified file name to the root directory and add the desired version number as the contents of the file (e.g. 22)

## Pre-installed packages
