Workers Builds' build environment has broad support for a variety of languages, such as Ruby, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Go.

If you need to use a [specific version](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-image/#overriding-default-versions) of a language, (for example, Node.js or Ruby) you can specify it by providing an associated environment variable in your build configuration, or setting the relevant file in your source code.

## Supported Languages and Tools

In the following tables, review the preinstalled versions for languages and tools included in the Cloudflare Pages' build image, and the environment variables and/or files available for [overriding the preinstalled version](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-image/#overriding-default-versions):

| Tool        | Default version  | Supported versions | Environment variable | File                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Go**      | 1.22.0           | Any version        | `GO_VERSION`         |                              |
| **Node.js** | 20.16.0          | Any version        | `NODE_VERSION`       | .nvmrc, .node-version        |
| **Python**  | 3.12.5           | Any version        | `PYTHON_VERSION`     | .python-version, runtime.txt |
| **Ruby**    | 3.3.4            | Any version        | `RUBY_VERSION`       | .ruby-version                |
| **Bun**     | 1.1.22           | Any version        | `BUN_VERSION`        |                              |
| **Hugo**    | extended_0.130.0 | Any version        | `HUGO_VERSION`       |                              |

:::note[Any version]
Under Supported versions, "Any version" refers to support for all versions of the language or tool including versions newer than the Default version.

### Frameworks

To use a specific version of a framework, specify it in the project's package manager configuration file.
For example, if you use Gatsby, your `package.json` should include the following:

```
"dependencies": {
	"gatsby": "^5.13.7",
}
```

When your build starts, version 5.13.7 of Gatsby will be installed using `npm install`.

## Overriding default versions

To override default versions of languages and tools in the build system, you can either set the desired version through environment variables or by adding files to your project.

To set the version using **environment variables**, you can:

1. Find the environment variable name for the language or tool in [this table]().
2. Add the environment variable on the dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Environmnet variables** in your Pages project, or [add the environment variable via Wrangler](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#add-environment-variables-via-wrangler).

Or, to set the version by **adding a file** to your project, you can:

1. Find the environment variable name for the language or tool in [this table]().
2. Add the specified file name to the root directory of your project, and add the desired version number as the contents of the file.

For example, if you were previously relying on the default version of Node.js in the v1 build system, to migrate to v2, you must specify that you need Node.js `12.18.0` by setting a `NODE_VERSION = 12.18.0` environment variable or by adding a `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` file to your project with `12.18.0` added as the contents to the file.

## Build Environment

Cloudflare Workers builds are run in the following environment:

|                       |              |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Build Enviornment** | Ubuntu 24.04 |
| **Architecture**      | x86_64       |

## Container Resources

Each build will have the following resources:

|                |        |
| -------------- | ------ |
| **CPU**        | 2 CPUs |
| **Disk Space** | 8 GB   |
| **Memory**     | 8 GB   |
