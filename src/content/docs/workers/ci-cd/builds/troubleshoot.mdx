## Known Issues

- **GitLab project:** Currently in Beta, GitLab projects are not yet supported. Only GitHub projects are supported.
- **Hardcoded build environment variables:** In the Build Details view, the build environment variables they are hardcoded. We will be removing the hardcoding soon.
- **Deleted API Keys listed:** In build configurations, you may see deleted API Keys still appear in the list of selectable API Keys.
- **Disconnect repository when deleting a Worker:** When you delete a Worker, you should first disconnect the associated git repository in 'Settings > Build'. This will ensure that you will be able to reuse that repository with other Workers.
- **Long intialization time:** Our initialization times can be slow at the moment, we are working on patching this issue. If you are experiencing more than 5 minutes of initialization time, please try cancelling the build and triggering a new deployment.
- **Wrangler.toml and Workers dashboard project name mismatch:** When you deploy a Worker that has a different name on the dashboard from its Wrangler.toml, then the project will build in the Worker you made the git connection on but deploy to a Worker with the same name as the one specified in the Wrangler.toml. To avoid this issue, please ensure that the project name in the Wrangler.toml matches the project name on the dashboard.
