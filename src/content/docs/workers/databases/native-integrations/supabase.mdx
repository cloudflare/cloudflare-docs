[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open source Firebase alternative and a PostgreSQL database service that offers real-time functionality, database backups, and extensions. With Supabase, developers can quickly set up a PostgreSQL database and build applications.

## Set up an integration with Supabase

To set up an integration with Supabase:

1. You need to have an existing Supabase database to connect to. [Create a Supabase database](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables#creating-tables) or [have an existing database to connect to Supabase and load data from](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables#loading-data).

2. Create a `countries` table with the following query. You can create a table in your Supabase dashboard in two ways:

   * Use the table editor, which allows you to set up Postgres similar to a spreadsheet.
   * Alternatively, use the [SQL editor](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor):

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE countries (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. Insert some data in your newly created table. Run the following commands to add countries to your table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO countries (name) VALUES ('United States');
   INSERT INTO countries (name) VALUES ('Canada');
   INSERT INTO countries (name) VALUES ('The Netherlands');
   ```

4. Add the Supabase database integration to your Worker:

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
   2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
   3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
   4. Select **Integrations** > **Supabase**.
   5. Follow the setup flow, selecting the database created in step 1.

5. In your Worker, install the `@supabase/supabase-js`  driver to connect to your database and start manipulating data:

   ```sh
   $ npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

6. The following example shows how to make a query to your Supabase database in a Worker. The credentials needed to connect to Supabase have been automatically added as secrets to your Worker through the integration.

   ```sql
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

   export default {
     async fetch(request, env) {
       const supabase = createClient(env.SUPABASE_URL, env.SUPABASE_KEY);
       const { data, error } = await supabase.from("countries").select('*');
       if (error) throw error;
       return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
         headers: {
           "Content-Type": "application/json",
         },
       });
     },
   };
   ```
