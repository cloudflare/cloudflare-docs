[Upstash](https://upstash.com/) is a serverless database with Redis\* and Kafka API. Upstash also offers QStash, a task queue/scheduler designed for the serverless.

<Render file="database_integrations_definition" />

## Upstash for Redis

To set up an integration with Upstash:

1. You need an existing Upstash database to connect to. [Create an Upstash database](https://docs.upstash.com/redis#create-a-database) or [load data from an existing database to Upstash](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/howto/connectclient).

2. Insert some data to your Upstash database. You can add data to your Upstash database in two ways:

   - Use the CLI directly from your Upstash console.
   - Alternatively, install [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) locally and run the following commands.

   ```sh
   set GB "Ey up?"
   ```

   ```sh output
   OK
   ```

   ```sh
   set US "Yo, what’s up?"
   ```

   ```sh output
   OK
   ```

   ```sh
   set NL "Hoi, hoe gaat het?"
   ```

   ```sh output
   OK
   ```

3. Add the Upstash Redis integration to your Worker:

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
   2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
   3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
   4. Select **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Upstash Redis**.
   5. Follow the setup flow, selecting the database created in step 1.

4. In your Worker, install the `@upstash/redis`, a HTTP client to connect to your database and start manipulating data:

   ```sh
   npm install @upstash/redis
   ```

5. The following example shows how to make a query to your Upstash database in a Worker. The credentials needed to connect to Upstash have been automatically added as secrets to your Worker through the integration.

```js
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/cloudflare";

export default {
	async fetch(request, env) {
		const redis = Redis.fromEnv(env);

		const country = request.headers.get("cf-ipcountry");
		if (country) {
			const greeting = await redis.get(country);
			if (greeting) {
				return new Response(greeting);
			}
		}

		return new Response("Hello What's up!");
	},
};
```

:::note

`Redis.fromEnv(env)` automatically picks up the default `url` and `token` names created in the integration.

If you have renamed the secrets, you must declare them explicitly like in the [Upstash basic example](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/redis-ts/getstarted#basic-usage).

## Upstash Kafka

To set up an integration with Upstash Kafka:

1. Create a [Kafka cluster and topic](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka).

2. Add the Upstash Kafka integration to your Worker:

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
   2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
   3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
   4. Select **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Upstash Kafka**.
   5. Follow the setup flow, selecting the cluster and topic.

3. In your Worker, install `@upstash/kafka`, a HTTP/REST based Kafka client:

   ```sh
   npm install @upstash/kafka
   ```

4. Use the [upstash-kafka](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-kafka/blob/main/README.md) JavaScript SDK to send data to Kafka.

Refer to [Upstash documentation on Kafka setup with Workers](https://docs.upstash.com/kafka/real-time-analytics/realtime_analytics_serverless_kafka_setup#option-1-cloudflare-workers) for more information. Replace `url`, `username` and `password` with the variables set by the integration.

## Upstash QStash

To set up an integration with Upstash QStash:

1. Configure the [publicly available HTTP endpoint](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash#1-public-api) that you want to send your messages to.

2. Add the Upstash QStash integration to your Worker:

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
   2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
   3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
   4. Select **Integrations** > **Upstash QStash**.
   5. Follow the setup flow.

3. In your Worker, install the `@upstash/qstash`, a HTTP client to connect to your database QStash endpoint:

   ```sh
   npm install @upstash/qstash
   ```

4. Refer to the [Upstash documentation on how to receive webhooks from QStash in your Cloudflare Worker](https://docs.upstash.com/qstash/quickstarts/cloudflare-workers#3-use-qstash-in-your-handler).
