## Set up an integration with Fauna

To set up an integration with Fauna:

1. You need to have an existing Fauna database to connect to. [Create a Fauna database with demo data](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/get-started/quick-start/?lang=javascript#create-a-database).

2. Once your database is created with demo data, you can query it directly using the Shell tab in the Fauna dashboard:

	```sh
	Customer.all()
	```

3. Add the Fauna database integration to your Worker:

	1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
	2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
	3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
	4. Select **Integrations** > **Fauna**.
	5. Follow the setup flow, selecting the database created in step 1.

4. In your Worker, install the `fauna` driver to connect to your database and start manipulating data:

	```sh
	npm install fauna
	```

5. The following example shows how to make a query to your Fauna database in a Worker. The credentials needed to connect to Fauna have been automatically added as secrets to your Worker through the integration.

	```javascript
	import { Client, fql } from 'fauna';

	export default {
		async fetch(request, env) {
			const fauna = new Client({
				secret: env.FAUNA_SECRET
			});
			const query = fql`Customer.all()`;
			const result = await fauna.query(query);
			return Response.json(result.data);
		}
	};
	```

6. You can manage the Cloudflare Fauna integration from the [Fauna Dashboard](https://dashboard.fauna.com/):

	- To view Fauna keys for an integrated Cloudflare Worker, select your database and click the **Keys** tab.

		Keys for a Cloudflare Worker integration are prepended with `_cloudflare_key_`.

		![Key tab for a database in the Fauna Dashboard](~/assets/images/workers/databases/native-integrations/fauna_keys_tab.png)

		You can delete the key to disable the integration.

	- When you connect a Cloudflare Worker to your database, Fauna creates an OAuth client app in your Fauna account.

		To view your account's OAuth apps, go to **Account Settings > OAuth Apps** in the Fauna Dashboard.

		![OAuth apps in Fauna](~/assets/images/workers/databases/native-integrations/fauna_oauth.png)

		You can delete the app to disable the integration.
