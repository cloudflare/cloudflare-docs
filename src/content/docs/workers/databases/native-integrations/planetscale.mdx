[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) is a MySQL-compatible platform that makes databases infinitely scalable, easier and safer to manage.

## Set up an integration with PlanetScale

To set up an integration with PlanetScale:

1. You need to have an existing PlanetScale database to connect to. [Create a PlanetScale database](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide#create-a-database) or [import an existing database to PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/docs/imports/database-imports#overview).

2. From the [PlanetScale web console](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/web-console#get-started), create a `products` table with the following query:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
     id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
     image_url varchar(255),
     category_id INT,
     KEY category_id_idx (category_id)
   );
   ```

3. Insert some data in your newly created table. Run the following command to add a product and category to your table:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO products (name, image_url, category_id)
   VALUES ('Ballpoint pen', 'https://example.com/500x500', '1');
   ```

4. Add the PlanetScale integration to your Worker:

   1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
   2. In **Account Home**, select **Workers & Pages**.
   3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
   4. Select **Integrations** > **PlanetScale**.
   5. Follow the setup flow, selecting the database created in step 1.

5. In your Worker, install the `@planetscale/database` driver to connect to your PlanetScale database and start manipulating data:

   ```sh
   npm install @planetscale/database
   ```

6. The following example shows how to make a query to your PlanetScale database in a Worker. The credentials needed to connect to PlanetScale have been automatically added as secrets to your Worker through the integration.

   ```js
   import { connect } from "@planetscale/database";

   export default {
   	async fetch(request, env) {
   		const config = {
   			host: env.DATABASE_HOST,
   			username: env.DATABASE_USERNAME,
   			password: env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,
   			// see https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/698
   			fetch: (url, init) => {
   				delete init["cache"];
   				return fetch(url, init);
   			},
   		};

   		const conn = connect(config);
   		const data = await conn.execute("SELECT * FROM products;");
   		return new Response(JSON.stringify(data.rows), {
   			status: 200,
   			headers: {
   				"Content-Type": "application/json",
   			},
   		});
   	},
   };
   ```
