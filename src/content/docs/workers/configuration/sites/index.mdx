Workers Sites enables developers to deploy static applications directly to Workers. It can be used for deploying applications built with static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), or front-end frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

***

## 1. Start from scratch
