import { Render } from "~/components";

Preview URLs allow you to preview new versions of your Worker without deploying it to production.

Every time you create a new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker a unique preview URL is generated. Preview URLs take the format: `<VERSION_PREFIX>-<WORKER_NAME>.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`. New [versions](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of a Worker are created on [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy), [`wrangler versions upload`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#upload) or when you make edits on the Cloudflare dashboard. By default, preview URLs are enabled and available publicly.

Preview URLs can be:

- Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing automatic generation of preview environments for every pull request.
- Used for collaboration between teams to test code changes in a live environment and verify updates.
- Used to test new API endpoints, validate data formats, and ensure backward compatibility with existing services.

When testing zone level performance or security featues for a version, we recommended using [version overrides](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/#version-overrides) so that your zone's performance and security settings apply.

:::note
Preview URLs are only available for Worker versions uploaded after 2024-09-25.

Minimum required Wrangler version: 3.74.0. Check your version by running `wrangler --version`. To update Wrangler, refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## View preview URLs using wrangler

The [`wrangler versions upload`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#upload) command uploads a new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker and returns a preview URL for each version uploaded.

## View preview URLs on the Workers dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) and select your project.
2. Head to the "Deployments" tab find the version you would like to view.

## Manage access to Preview URLs

By default, preview URLs are enabled and available publicly. You can use [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to require visitors to authenticate before accessing preview URLs. You can limit access to yourself, your teammates, your organization, or anyone else you specify in your [access policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access).

To limit your preview URLs to authorized emails only:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Access dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/access/apps).
2. Select your account.
3. Add an application.
4. Select **Self Hosted**.
5. Name your application (for example, "my-worker") and add your `workers.dev` subdomain as the "Application domain".

For example, if you want to secure preview URLs for a Worker running on `my-worker.my-subdomain.workers.dev`.

- Subdomain: `*-my-worker`
- Domain: `my-subdomain.workers.dev`

:::note
You must press enter after you input your Application domain for it to save. You will see a "Zone is not associated with the current account" warning that you may ignore.
:::

6. Go to the next page.
7. Add a name for your access policy (for example, "Allow employees access to preview URLs for my-worker")
8. In the "Configure rules" section create a new rule with the "Emails" selector, or any other attributes which you wish to gate access to previews with. Enter the emails you want to authorize. View [access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/#selectors) to learn about configuring alternate rules.
9. Go to the next page.
10. Add application.

## Making Preview URLs inaccessible

Preview URLs run on your [`workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/). To make preview URLs inaccessible, you must disable your Workers `workers.dev` subdomain. Learn how to [disable your Workers `workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/#disabling-workersdev).

## Limitations

- Preview URLs are not generated for Workers that implement a [Durable Object](/durable-objects/).
- Preview URLs are not currently generated for [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) [user Workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers). This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
