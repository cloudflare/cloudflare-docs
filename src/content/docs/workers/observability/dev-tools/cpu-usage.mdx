description: Learn how to profile CPU usage and ensure CPU-time per request stays under Workers limits
---

CPU-intensive tasks can slow down a Worker's request or startup time. If a Worker spends too much time
performing CPU operations, responses may be slow or startup may fail due to
[startup time limits](/workers/platform/limits/#worker-startup-time).

Profiling in DevTools can help you identify and fix code that uses too much CPU.

Measuring execution time of specific functions in production can be difficult because Workers
[only increment timers on I/O](/workers/reference/security-model/#step-1-disallow-timers-and-multi-threading)
for security purposes. However, measuring CPU execution times is possible in local development with DevTools.

## Taking a profile

To get started:

- Run `wrangler dev` to run your Worker
- Hit <kbd>d</kbd> from your terminal to open DevTools
- Click on the "Profiler" tab
- Click `Start` to begin recording CPU usage
- Send requests to your Worker from a new tab
- Click `Stop`

You now have a CPU profile.

## Example Profiling

Let's look at example code to learn how to read a CPU profile. Imagine you have the following Worker code:

```js title="index.js"
const addNumbers = (body) => {
	for (let i = 0; i < 5000; ++i) {
		body = body + " " + i;
	}
	return body;
};

const moreAddition = (body) => {
	for (let i = 5001; i < 15000; ++i) {
		body = body + " " + i;
	}
	return body;
};

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		let body = "Hello Profiler! - ";
		body = addNumbers(body);
		body = moreAddition(body);
		return new Response(body);
	},
};
```

You want to find which part of the code is causing slow response times. How do you use DevTool profiling to identify the
CPU-heavy code and fix the issue?

First, as mentioned above, you open DevTools by hitting <kbd>d</kbd> after running `wrangler dev`. Then, you
navigate to the "Profiler" tab and take a profile by hitting start and sending a request.

The top chart in this image shows a timeline of the profile, and you can use it to zoom in on a specific request.

The chart below shows the CPU time used for operations run during the request. In this screenshot, you can see
"fetch" time at the top and the subscomponents of fetch beneath, including the two functions `addNumbers` and
`moreAdditions`. By hovering over each box, you get more information, and by clicking the box, you navigate
to the function's source code.

Using this graph, you can answer the question of "what is taking CPU time?". The `addNumbers` function has
a very small box, representing 0.3ms of CPU time. The `moreAdditions` box is larger, representing 2.2ms of CPU time.

Therefore, if you want to make response times faster, you need to optimize `moreAdditions`.

You can also change the visualization from ‘Chart’ to ‘Heavy (Bottom Up)’ for an alternative view.

This shows the relative times allocated to each function. At the top of the list, `moreAdditions` is clearly the
slowest portion of your Worker. You can see that garbage collection also represents a large percentage of time, so
memory optimization could be useful.
