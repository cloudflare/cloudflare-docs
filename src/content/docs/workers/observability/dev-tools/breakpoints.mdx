## Debug via breakpoints

As of Wrangler 3.9.0, you can debug via breakpoints in your Worker. Breakpoints provide the ability to review what is happening at a given point in the execution of your Worker. Breakpoint functionality exists in both DevTools and VS Code.

For more information on breakpoint debugging via Chrome's DevTools, refer to [Chrome's article on breakpoints](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/).

### Setup VS Code to use breakpoints

To setup VS Code for breakpoint debugging in your Worker project:

1. Create a `.vscode` folder in your project's root folder if one does not exist.
2. Within that folder, create a `launch.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Wrangler",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9229,
      "cwd": "/",
      "resolveSourceMapLocations": null,
      "attachExistingChildren": false,
      "autoAttachChildProcesses": false,
      "sourceMaps": true // works with or without this line
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Open your project in VS Code, open a new terminal window from VS Code, and run `npx wrangler dev` to start the local dev server.

4. At the top of the **Run & Debug** panel, you should see an option to select a configuration. Choose **Wrangler**, and select the play icon. **Wrangler: Remote Process \[0]** should show up in the Call Stack panel on the left.

5. Go back to a `.js` or `.ts` file in your project and add at least one breakpoint.

6. Open your browser and go to the Worker's local URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`). The breakpoint should be hit, and you should be able to review details about your code at the specified line.

:::caution

Breakpoint debugging in `wrangler dev` using `--remote` could extend Worker CPU time and incur additional costs since you are testing against actual resources that count against usage limits. It is recommended to use `wrangler dev` without the `--remote` option. This ensures you are developing locally.

:::

:::note

The `.vscode/launch.json` file only applies to a single workspace. If you prefer, you can add the above launch configuration to your User Settings (per the [official VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_global-launch-configuration)) to have it available for all your workspaces.
