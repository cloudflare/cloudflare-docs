## Using DevTools

When running your Worker locally using `wrangler dev`, you automatically have access to [Cloudflare's implementation](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler-devtools?cf_target_id=115890352C73E75FD7D837D0B8720E96) of [Chrome's DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview).
DevTools help you debug and optimize your Workers.

:::note
You may have experience using Chrome's DevTools for frontend development. Notably, Worker DevTools are used for backend code and _not_ client-side JavaScript.

## Opening DevTools

To get started, run your Worker in development mode with `wrangler dev`, then open the DevTools in the browser by hitting <kbd>d</kbd> from your terminal. Now when you access this worker locally, it can be debugged and profiled with this DevTools instance.

Alternatively, both the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and the [Worker's Playground](https://workers.cloudflare.com/playground) include DevTools in their UI.

## DevTool use cases

DevTools can be used in a variety of situations. For more information, see the documentation:

- [Debugging code via breakpoints and logging](/workers/observability/dev-tools/breakpoints/)
- [Profiling CPU usage](/workers/observability/dev-tools/cpu-usage/)
- [Addressing out of memory (OOM) errors](/workers/observability/dev-tools/memory-usage/)
