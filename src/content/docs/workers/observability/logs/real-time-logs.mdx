With Real-time logs, access all your log events in near real-time for log events happening globally. Real-time logs is helpful for immediate feedback, such as the status of a new deployment.

Real-time logs captures [execution logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#execution-logs), [custom logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#custom-logs), errors, and uncaught exceptions. For high-traffic applications, real-time logs may enter sampling mode, which means some messages will be dropped and a warning will appear in your logs.

:::caution

Real-time logs are not available for zones on the [Cloudflare China Network](/china-network/).

## View logs from the dashboard

To view real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard:

<Steps>
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, go to **Workers & Pages**.
3. In **Overview**, select your **Worker**.
4. Select **Logs**. 
5. In the right-hand navigation bar, select **Live**.
</Steps>

## View logs using `wrangler tail`

To view real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker using Wrangler:

1. Go to your Worker project directory.
2. Run [`npx wrangler tail`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#tail).

This will log any incoming requests to your application available in your local terminal.

The output of each `wrangler tail` log is a structured JSON object:

```json
{
	"outcome": "ok",
	"scriptName": null,
	"exceptions": [],
	"logs": [],
	"eventTimestamp": 1590680082349,
	"event": {
		"request": {
			"url": "https://www.bytesized.xyz/",
			"method": "GET",
			"headers": {},
			"cf": {}
		}
	}
}
```

By piping the output to tools like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), you can query and manipulate the requests to look for specific information:

```sh
npx wrangler tail | jq .event.request.url
```

```sh output
"https://www.bytesized.xyz/"
"https://www.bytesized.xyz/component---src-pages-index-js-a77e385e3bde5b78dbf6.js"
"https://www.bytesized.xyz/page-data/app-data.json"
```

You can customize how `wrangler tail` works to fit your needs. Refer to [the `wrangler tail` documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#tail) for available configuration options.

## Limits

:::note

You can filter real-time logs in the dashboard or using [`wrangler tail`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#tail). If your Worker has a high volume of messages, filtering real-time logs can help mitgate messages from being dropped.

:::

Note that:

- Real-time logs does not store Workers Logs. To store logs, use [Workers Logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs).
- If your Worker has a high volume of traffic, the real-time logs might enter sampling mode. This will cause some of your messages to be dropped and a warning to appear in your logs.
- Logs from any [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) your Worker is using will show up in the dashboard.
- A maximum of 10 clients can view a Worker's logs at one time. This can be a combination of either dashboard sessions or `wrangler tail` calls.

## Persist logs

Logs can be persisted, filtered, and analyzed with [Workers Logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs). To send logs to a third party, use [Workers Logpush](/workers/observability/logs/logpush/) or [Tail Workers](/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/).
