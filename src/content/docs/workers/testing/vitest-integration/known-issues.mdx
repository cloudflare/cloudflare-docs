description: Explore the known issues associated with the Workers Vitest integration.

---

The Workers Vitest pool is currently in open beta. The following are issues Cloudflare is aware of and fixing:

### Coverage

Native code coverage via [V8](https://v8.dev/blog/javascript-code-coverage) is not supported. You must use instrumented code coverage via [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) instead. Refer to the [Vitest Coverage documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage) for setup instructions.

### Fake timers

Vitest's [fake timers](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#timers) do not apply to KV, R2 and cache simulators. For example, you cannot expire a KV key by advancing fake time.

### Dynamic `import()` statements with `SELF` and Durable Objects

Dynamic `import()` statements do not work inside `export default { ... }` handlers when writing integration tests with `SELF`, or inside Durable Object event handlers. You must import and call your handlers directly, or use static `import` statements in the global scope.

### Durable Object alarms

Durable Object alarms are not reset between test runs and do not respect isolated storage. Ensure you delete or run all alarms with [`runDurableObjectAlarm()`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/test-apis/#durable-objects) scheduled in each test before finishing the test.

### Durable Objects and `isolatedStorage`

Using WebSockets with Durable Objects with the [`isolatedStorage`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/isolation-and-concurrency) flag turned on is not supported. You must set `isolatedStorage: false` in your `vitest.config.ts` file.

### Returning non-primitive values from RPC methods

In order to return non-primitive values (objects or classes extending `RpcTarget`, for instance) from RPC methods, you must use the `using` keyword. Refer to [https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle#explicit-resource-management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/lifecycle#explicit-resource-management) for more details. An [example test](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/fixtures/vitest-pool-workers-examples/rpc/test/unit.test.ts#L155) is included in the `workers-sdk` repository.
