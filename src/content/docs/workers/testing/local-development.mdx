description: Develop your Workers locally via Wrangler.
---

Cloudflare Workers and most connected resources can be fully developed and tested locally - providing confidence that the applications you build locally will work the same way in production. This allows you to be more efficient and effective by providing a faster feedback loop and removing the need to test against remote resources. Local development runs against the same production runtime used by Cloudflare Workers, [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd).

In addition to testing Workers locally with [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev), the use of Miniflare allows you to test other Developer Platform products locally, such as [R2](/r2/), [KV](/kv/), [D1](/d1/), and [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/).

## Start a local development server

:::note

This guide assumes you are using [Wrangler v3.0](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wrangler3/) or later.

Users new to Wrangler CLI and Cloudflare Workers should visit the [Wrangler Install/Update guide](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update) to install `wrangler`.

:::

Wrangler provides a [`dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command that starts a local server for developing your Worker. Make sure you have `npm` installed and run the following in the folder containing your Worker application:

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

`wrangler dev` will run the Worker directly on your local machine. `wrangler dev` uses a combination of `workerd` and [Miniflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/miniflare), a simulator that allows you to test your Worker against additional resources like KV, Durable Objects, WebSockets, and more.

With any bindings that are not supported locally, you will need to use the `--remote` command in wrangler, such as `wrangler dev --remote`.

[^1]: Using Workers AI always accesses your Cloudflare account in order to run AI models and will incur usage charges even in local development.

## Work with local data

When running `wrangler dev`, resources such as KV, Durable Objects, D1, and R2 will be stored and persisted locally and not affect the production resources.

### Use bindings in `wrangler.toml`

[Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) will automatically create local versions of bindings found in the `wrangler.toml` [configuration file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/). These local resources will not have data in them initially, so you will need to add data manually via Wrangler commands and the [`--local` flag](/workers/testing/local-development/#use---local-flag).

When you run `wrangler dev` Wrangler stores local resources in a `.wrangler/state` folder, which is automatically created.

If you prefer to specify a directory, you can use the [`--persist-to`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) flag with `wrangler dev` like this:

```sh
npx wrangler dev --persist-to <DIRECTORY>
```

Using this will write all local storage and cache to the specified directory instead of `.wrangler`.

:::note

This local persistence folder should be added to your `.gitignore` file.

:::

### Use `--local` flag

The following [Wrangler commands](/workers/wrangler/commands/) have a `--local` flag which allows you to create, update, and delete local data during development:

| Command                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [`d1 execute`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#execute)  |
| [`kv:key`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#kv-key)       |
| [`kv:bulk`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#kv-bulk)     |
| [`r2 object`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#r2-object) |

If using `--persist-to` to specify a custom folder with `wrangler dev` you should also add `--persist-to` with the same directory name along with the `--local` flag when running the commands above. For example, to put a custom KV key into a local namespace via the CLI you would run:

```sh
npx wrangler kv:key put test 12345 --binding MY_KV_NAMESPACE --local --persist-to worker-local
```

Running `wrangler kv:key put` will create a new key `test` with a value of `12345` on the local namespace specified via the binding `MY_KV_NAMESPACE` in `wrangler.toml`. This example command sets the local persistence directory to `worker-local` using `--persist-to`, to ensure that the data is created in the correct location. If `--persist-to` was not set, it would create the data in the `.wrangler` folder.

### Clear Wrangler's local storage

If you need to clear local storage entirely, delete the `.wrangler/state` folder. You can also be more fine-grained and delete specific resource folders within `.wrangler/state`.

Any deleted folders will be created automatically the next time you run `wrangler dev`.

## Local-only environment variables

When running `wrangler dev`, variables in `wrangler.toml` are automatically overridden by values defined in a `.dev.vars` file located in the root directory of your worker. This is useful for providing values you do not want to check in to source control.

```shell
API_HOST = "localhost:4000"
API_ACCOUNT_ID = "local_example_user"
```

## Develop using remote resources and bindings

There may be times you want to develop against remote resources and bindings. To run `wrangler dev` in remote mode, add the `--remote` flag, which will run both your code and resources remotely:

```sh
npx wrangler dev --remote
```

For some products like KV and R2, remote resources used for `wrangler dev --remote` must be specified with preview ID/names in `wrangler.toml` such as `preview_id` for KV or `preview_bucket name` for R2. Resources used for remote mode (preview) can be different from resources used for production to prevent changing production data during development. To use production data in `wrangler dev --remote`, set the preview ID/name of the resource to the ID/name of your production resource.

## Customize `wrangler dev`

You can customize how `wrangler dev` works to fit your needs. Refer to [the `wrangler dev` documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) for available configuration options.

:::caution

There is a bug associated with how outgoing requests are handled when using `wrangler dev --remote`. For more information, read the [Known issues section](/workers/platform/known-issues/#wrangler-dev).
