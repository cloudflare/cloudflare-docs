Quickstarts are GitHub repositories that are designed to be a starting point for building a new Cloudflare Workers project. To start any of the projects below, run:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest <NEW_PROJECT_NAME> -- --template <GITHUB_REPO_URL>
```

- `new-project-name`

  - A folder with this name will be created with your new project inside, pre-configured to [your Workers account](/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

- `template`
  - This is the URL of the GitHub repo starter, as below. Refer to the [create-cloudflare documentation](/pages/get-started/c3/) for a full list of possible values.
