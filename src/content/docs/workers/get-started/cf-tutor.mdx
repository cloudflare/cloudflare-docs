Cloudflare CLI tutor, or `cf-tutor`, is a guided learning experience within your terminal. If you are unfamiliar with Workers, or are new to command line interface (CLI) based development, cf-tutor offers an introduction on how to use Workers with other Cloudflare products through your terminal.

`cf-tutor` is currently a beta application in pre-release. To download the application, you can use the `git clone` in your terminal, or download the application from the releases page on the project repo.
