import { DirectoryListing } from "~/components"

Workers is a polyglot platform, and provides first-class support for the following programming languages:

<DirectoryListing />

Workers also supports [WebAssembly](/workers/runtime-apis/webassembly/) (abbreviated as "Wasm") â€” a binary format that many languages can be compiled to. This allows you to write Workers using programming language beyond the languages listed above, including C, C++, Kotlin, Go and more.
