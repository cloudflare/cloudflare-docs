import { TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components";

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a first-class language on Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare publishes type definitions to [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-types) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types) (`npm install -D @cloudflare/workers-types`). All APIs provided in Workers are fully typed, and type definitions are generated directly from [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers runtime.

### Generate types that match your Worker's configuration (experimental)

Cloudflare continuously improves [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers runtime.
Some updates change the TypeScript types that APIs return. For example, the [`urlsearchparams_delete_has_value_arg`](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#urlsearchparams-delete-and-has-value-argument) compatibility flag adds optional arguments to some methods, in order to support new additions to the WHATWG URL standard API.

This means the correct TypeScript types for your Worker depend on:

1. Your Worker's [Compatibility Date](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/).
2. Your Worker's [Compatibility Flags](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#compatibility-flags).

For example, if you have `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_als"]` in your `wrangler.toml`, then the runtime will allow you to use the [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) class in your worker code, but you will not see this reflected in the type definitions in `@cloudflare/workers-types`.

In order to solve this issue, and to ensure that your type definitions are always up-to-date with your compatibility settings, you can dynamically generate the runtime types (as of `wrangler 3.66.0`):

```bash
wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime
```

This will generate a `d.ts` file and (by default) save it to `.wrangler/types/runtime.d.ts`. You will be prompted in the command's output to add that file to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions.types` array.

If you would like to commit the file to git, you can provide a custom path. Here, for instance, the `runtime.d.ts` file will be saved to the root of your project:

```bash
wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime="./runtime.d.ts"
```

To ensure that your types are always up-to-date, make sure to run `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` after any changes to your config file.

#### Migrating from `@cloudflare/workers-types` to `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime`

The `@cloudflare/workers-types` package provides runtime types according to your compatibility date, but is superceeded by the `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` command.

Here are the steps to switch from `@cloudflare/workers-types` to using `wrangler types` with the experimental runtime inclusion:

##### Uninstall `@cloudflare/workers-types`

<Tabs> <TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm uninstall @cloudflare/workers-types
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn remove @cloudflare/workers-types
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm uninstall @cloudflare/workers-types
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun remove @cloudflare/workers-types
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

##### Generate runtime types using wrangler

```bash
wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime
```

This will generate a `.d.ts` file, saved to `.wrangler/types/runtime.d.ts` by default.

##### Update your `tsconfig.json` to include the generated types

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["./.wrangler/types/runtime"]
  }
}
```

Note that if you have specified a custom path for the runtime types file, you should use that in your `compilerOptions.types` array instead of the default path.

##### Update your scripts and CI pipelines

When switching to `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime`, you'll want to ensure that your development process always uses the most up-to-date types. The main thing to remember here is that - regardless of your specific framework or build tools - you should run the `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` command before any development tasks that rely on TypeScript. This ensures your editor and build tools always have access to the latest types.

Most projects will have existing build and development scripts scripts, as well as some type-checking. In the example below, we're adding the `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` before the type-checking script in the project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "existing-dev-command",
    "build": "-existing-build-command",
    "type-check": "wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime && tsc"
  }
}
```

In CI, you may have a separate build and test commands. It is best practice to run `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` before other CI commands. For example:

<Tabs> <TabItem label="npm">

```yaml
- run: npm run generate-types
- run: npm run build
- run: npm test
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="yarn">

```yaml
- run: yarn generate-types
- run: yarn build
- run: yarn test
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="pnpm">

```yaml
- run: pnpm run generate-types
- run: pnpm run build
- run: pnpm test
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="bun">

```yaml
- run: bun run generate-types
- run: bun run build
- run: bun test
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

By integrating the `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` command into your workflow this way, you ensure that your development environment, builds, and CI processes always use the most accurate and up-to-date types for your Cloudflare Worker, regardless of your specific framework or tooling choices.

### Known issues

#### Transitive loading of `@types/node` overrides `@cloudflare/workers-types`

You project's dependencies may load the `@types/node` package on their own. As of `@types/node@20.8.4` that package now overrides `Request`, `Response` and `fetch` types (possibly others) specified by `@cloudflare/workers-types` causing type errors.

The way to get around this issue currently is to pin the version of `@types/node` to `20.8.3` in your `package.json` like this:

```json
{
	"overrides": {
		"@types/node": "20.8.3"
	}
}
```
