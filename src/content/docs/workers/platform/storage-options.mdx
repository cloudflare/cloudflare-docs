description: Storage and database options available on Cloudflare's developer platform.
---

import { Render } from "~/components";

Cloudflare Workers support a range of storage and database options for persisting different types of data across different use-cases, from key-value stores (like [Workers KV](/kv/)) through to SQL databases (such as [D1](/d1/)). This guide describes the use-cases suited to each storage option, as well as their performance and consistency properties.

:::note[Pages Functions]

Storage options can also be used by your front-end application built with Cloudflare Pages. For more information on available storage options for Pages applications, refer to the [Pages Functions bindings documentation](/pages/functions/bindings/).

:::

Available storage and persistency products include:

- [Workers KV](#workers-kv) for key-value storage.
- [R2](#r2) for object storage, including use-cases where S3 compatible storage is required.
- [Durable Objects](#durable-objects) for transactional, globally coordinated storage.
- [D1](#d1) as a relational, SQL-based database.
- [Queues](#queues) for job queueing, batching and inter-Service (Worker to Worker) communication.
- [Hyperdrive](/hyperdrive/) for connecting to and speeding up access to existing hosted and on-premises databases.
- [Analytics Engine](/analytics/analytics-engine/) for storing and querying (using SQL) time-series data and product metrics at scale.
- [Vectorize](/vectorize/) for vector search and storing embeddings from [Workers AI](/workers-ai/).

Applications built on the Workers platform may combine one or more storage components as they grow, scale or as requirements demand.

## Workers KV

Workers KV is an eventually consistent key-value data store that caches on the Cloudflare global network.

It is ideal for projects that require:

- High volumes of reads and/or repeated reads to the same keys.
- Per-object time-to-live (TTL).
- Distributed configuration.

To get started with KV:

- Read how [KV works](/kv/concepts/how-kv-works/).
- Create a [KV namespace](/kv/concepts/kv-namespaces/).
- Review the [KV Runtime API](/kv/api/).
- Learn about KV [Limits](/kv/platform/limits/).

## R2

R2 is S3-compatible blob storage that allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data without egress fees associated with typical cloud storage services.

It is ideal for projects that require:

- Storage for files which are infrequently accessed.
- Large object storage (for example, gigabytes or more per object).
- Strong consistency per object.
- Asset storage for websites (refer to [caching guide](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#caching))

To get started with R2:

- Read the [Get started guide](/r2/get-started/).
- Learn about R2 [Limits](/r2/platform/limits/).
- Review the [R2 Workers API](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/).

## Durable Objects

Durable Objects provide low-latency coordination and consistent storage for the Workers platform through global uniqueness and a transactional storage API.

- Global Uniqueness guarantees that there will be a single instance of a Durable Object class with a given ID running at once, across the world. Requests for a Durable Object ID are routed by the Workers runtime to the Cloudflare data center that owns the Durable Object.

- The transactional storage API provides strongly consistent key-value storage to the Durable Object. Each Object can only read and modify keys associated with that Object. Execution of a Durable Object is single-threaded, but multiple request events may still be processed out-of-order from how they arrived at the Object.

It is ideal for projects that require:

- Real-time collaboration (such as a chat application or a game server).
- Consistent storage.
- Data locality.

To get started with Durable Objects:

- Read the [introductory blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/).
- Review the [Durable Objects documentation](/durable-objects/).
- Get started with [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/get-started/).
- Learn about Durable Objects [Limits](/durable-objects/platform/limits/).

## D1

[D1](/d1/) is Cloudflare’s native serverless database. With D1, you can create a database by importing data or defining your tables and writing your queries within a Worker or through the API.

D1 is ideal for:

- Persistent, relational storage for user data, account data, and other structured datasets.
- Use-cases that require querying across your data ad-hoc (using SQL).
- Workloads with a high ratio of reads to writes (most web applications).

To get started with D1:

- Read [the documentation](/d1)
- Follow the [Get started guide](/d1/get-started/) to provision your first D1 database.
- Review the [D1 client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/).

:::note
If your working data size exceeds 10 GB (the maximum size for a D1 database), consider splitting the database into multiple, smaller D1 databases.
:::

## Queues

Cloudflare Queues allows developers to send and receive messages with guaranteed delivery. It integrates with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers) and offers at-least once delivery, message batching, and does not charge for egress bandwidth.

Queues is ideal for:

- Offloading work from a request to schedule later.
- Send data from Worker to Worker (inter-Service communication).
- Buffering or batching data before writing to upstream systems, including third-party APIs or [Cloudflare R2](/queues/examples/send-errors-to-r2/).

To get started with Queues:

- [Set up your first queue](/queues/get-started/).
- Learn more [about how Queues works](/queues/reference/how-queues-works/).

## Hyperdrive

Hyperdrive is a service that accelerates queries you make to existing databases, making it faster to access your data from across the globe, irrespective of your users’ location.

Hyperdrive allows you to:

- Connect to an existing database from Workers without connection overhead.
- Cache frequent queries across Cloudflare's global network to reduce response times on highly trafficked content.
- Reduce load on your origin database with connection pooling.

To get started with Hyperdrive:

- [Connect Hyperdrive](/hyperdrive/get-started/) to your existing database.
- Learn more [about how Hyperdrive speeds up your database queries](/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/).

## Analytics Engine

Analytics Engine is Cloudflare's time-series and metrics database that allows you to write unlimited-cardinality analytics at scale using a built-in API to write data points from Workers and query that data using SQL directly.

Analytics Engine allows you to:

- Expose custom analytics to your own customers
- Build usage-based billing systems
- Understand the health of your service on a per-customer or per-user basis
- Add instrumentation to frequently called code paths, without impacting performance or overwhelming external analytics systems with events

Cloudflare uses Analytics Engine internally to store and product per-product metrics for products like D1 and R2 at scale.

To get started with Analytics Engine:

- Learn how to [get started with Analytics Engine](/analytics/analytics-engine/get-started/)
- See [an example of writing time-series data to Analytics Engine](/analytics/analytics-engine/recipes/usage-based-billing-for-your-saas-product/)
- Understand the [SQL API](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/) for reading data from your Analytics Engine datasets

## Vectorize

Vectorize is a globally distributed vector database that enables you to build full-stack, AI-powered applications with Cloudflare Workers and [Workers AI](/workers-ai/).

Vectorize allows you to:

- Store embeddings from any vector embeddings model (Bring Your Own embeddings) for semantic search and classification tasks.
- Add context to Large Language Model (LLM) queries by using vector search as part of a [Retrieval Augmented Generation](/workers-ai/tutorials/build-a-retrieval-augmented-generation-ai/) (RAG) workflow.
- [Filter on vector metadata](/vectorize/reference/metadata-filtering/) to reduce the search space and return more relevant results.

To get started with Vectorize:

- [Create your first vector database](/vectorize/get-started/intro/).
- Combine [Workers AI and Vectorize](/vectorize/get-started/embeddings/) to generate, store and query text embeddings.
- Learn more about [how vector databases work](/vectorize/reference/what-is-a-vector-database/).

:::note[SQLite in Durable Objects Beta]

The new beta version of Durable Objects is available where each Durable Object has a private, embedded SQLite database. When deploying a new Durable Object class, users can opt-in to using SQL storage in order to access [Storage SQL API methods](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sqlexec). Otherwise, a Durable Object class has the standard, private key-value storage.

:::

## D1 vs Hyperdrive

D1 is a standalone, serverless database that provides a SQL API, using SQLite's SQL semantics, to store and access your relational data.

Hyperdrive is a service that lets you connect to your existing, regional PostgreSQL databases and improves database performance by optimizing them for global, scalable data access from Workers.

- If you are building a new project on Workers or are considering migrating your data, use D1.
- If you are building a Workers project with an existing PostgreSQL database, use Hyperdrive.

:::note

You cannot use D1 with Hyperdrive.

However, D1 does not need to be used with Hyperdrive because it does not have slow connection setups which would benefit from Hyperdrive's connection pooling. D1 data can also be cached within Workers using the [Cache API](/workers/runtime-apis/cache/).
