import { ProductChangelog } from "~/components";

This changelog details meaningful changes made to Workers across the Cloudflare dashboard, Wrangler, the API, and the workerd runtime. These changes are not configurable.

This is *different* from the [compatibility dates of workerd](/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) which specifically gate individual runtime features and can be opted-in to or out from.
