In this tutorial, you will build a [Slack](https://slack.com) bot using [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). Your bot will make use of GitHub webhooks to send messages to a Slack channel when issues are updated or created, and allow users to write a command to look up GitHub issues from inside Slack.

![After following this tutorial, you will be able to create a Slackbot like the one in this example. Continue reading to build your Slackbot.](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/issue-command.png)

This tutorial is recommended for people who are familiar with writing web applications. You will use TypeScript as the programming language and [Hono](https://hono.dev/) as the web framework. If you have built an application with tools like [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Express](https://expressjs.com), this project will feel very familiar to you. If you are new to writing web applications or have wanted to build something like a Slack bot in the past, but were intimidated by deployment or configuration, Workers will be a way for you to focus on writing code and shipping projects.

If you would like to review the code or how the bot works in an actual Slack channel before proceeding with this tutorial, you can access the final version of the codebase [on GitHub](https://github.com/yusukebe/workers-slack-bot). From GitHub, you can add your own Slack API keys and deploy it to your own Slack channels for testing.

## Set up Slack

This tutorial assumes that you already have a Slack account, and the ability to create and manage Slack applications.

### Configure a Slack application

To post messages from your Cloudflare Worker into a Slack channel, you will need to create an application in Slack‚Äôs UI. To do this, go to Slack‚Äôs API section, at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), and select **Create New App**.

![To create a Slackbot, first create a Slack App](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/create-a-slack-app.png)

Slack applications have many features. You will make use of two of them, Incoming Webhooks and Slash Commands, to build your Worker-powered Slack bot.

#### Incoming Webhook

Incoming Webhooks are URLs that you can use to send messages to your Slack channels. Your incoming webhook will be paired with GitHub‚Äôs webhook support to send messages to a Slack channel whenever there are updates to issues in a given repository. You will see the code in more detail as you build your application. First, create a Slack webhook:

1. On the sidebar of Slack's UI, select **Incoming Webhooks**.
2. In **Webhook URLs for your Workspace**, select **Add New Webhook to Workspace**.
3. On the following screen, select the channel that you want your webhook to send messages to (you can select a room, like #general or #code, or be messaged directly by your Slack bot when the webhook is called.)
4. Authorize the new webhook URL.

After authorizing your webhook URL, you will be returned to the **Incoming Webhooks** page and can view your new webhook URL. You will add this into your Workers code later. Next, you will add the second component to your Slack bot: a Slash Command.

![Select Add New Webhook to Workspace to add a new Webhook URL in Slack's dashboard](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/slack-incoming-webhook.png)

#### Slash Command

A Slash Command in Slack is a custom-configured command that can be attached to a URL request. For example, if you configured `/weather <zip>`, Slack would make an HTTP POST request to a configured URL, passing the text `<zip>` to get the weather for a specified zip code. In your application, you will use the `/issue` command to look up GitHub issues using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com). Typing `/issue cloudflare/wrangler#1` will send the text `cloudflare/wrangler#1` in a HTTP POST request to your application, which the application will use to find the [relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1).

1. On the Slack sidebar, select **Slash Commands**.
2. Create your first slash command.

For this tutorial, you will use the command `/issue`. The request URL should be the `/lookup` path on your application URL: for example, if your application will be hosted at `https://myworkerurl.com`, the Request URL should be `https://myworkerurl.com/lookup`.

![You must create a Slash Command in Slack's dashboard and attach it to a Request URL](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/create-slack-command.png)

### Configure your GitHub Webhooks

Your Cloudflare Workers application will be able to handle incoming requests from Slack. It should also be able to receive events directly from GitHub. If a GitHub issue is created or updated, you can make use of GitHub webhooks to send that event to your Workers application and post a corresponding message in Slack.

To configure a webhook:

1. Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add webhook**.

If you have a repository like `https://github.com/user/repo`, you can access the **Webhooks** page directly at `https://github.com/user/repo/settings/hooks`.

2. Set the Payload URL to the `/webhook` path on your Worker URL.

For example, if your Worker will be hosted at `https://myworkerurl.com`, the Payload URL should be `https://myworkerurl.com/webhook`.

3. In the **Content type** dropdown, select **application/json**.

The **Content type** for your payload can either be a URL-encoded payload (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) or JSON (`application/json`). For the purpose of this tutorial and to make parsing the payload sent to your application, select JSON.

4. In **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**, select **Let me select individual events**.

GitHub webhooks allow you to specify which events you would like to have sent to your webhook. By default, the webhook will send `push` events from your repository. For the purpose of this tutorial, you will choose **Let me select individual events**.

5. Select the **Issues** event type.

There are many different event types that can be enabled for your webhook. Selecting **Issues** will send every issue-related event to your webhook, including when issues are opened, edited, deleted, and more. If you would like to expand your Slack bot application in the future, you can select more of these events after the tutorial.

6. Select **Add webhook**.

![Create a GitHub Webhook in the GitHub dashboard](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/new-github-webhook.png)

When your webhook is created, it will attempt to send a test payload to your application. Since your application is not actually deployed yet, leave the configuration as it is. You will later return to your repository to create, edit, and close some issues to ensure that the webhook is working once your application is deployed.

## Init

To initiate the project, use the command line interface [C3 (create-cloudflare-cli)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare).

<PackageManagers type="create" pkg="cloudflare@latest" args={'slack-bot'} />

Follow these steps to create a Hono project.

* For *What would you like to start with*?, select `Framework Starter`.
* For *Which development framework do you want to use?*, select `Hono`.
* For, *Do you want to deploy your application?*, select `No`.

Go to the `slack-bot` directory:

```sh
$ cd slack-bot
```

Open `src/index.ts` in an editor to find the following code.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

type Bindings = {
	[key in keyof CloudflareBindings]: CloudflareBindings[key];
};

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

app.get('/', (c) => {
	return c.text('Hello Hono!');
});

export default app;
```

This is a minimal application using Hono. If a GET access comes in on the path `/`, it will return a response with the text `Hello Hono!`. It also returns a message `404 Not Found` with status code 404 if any other path or method is accessed.

To run the application on your local machine, execute the following command.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="npm">

```sh title="Run your application locally"
$ npm run dev
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="yarn">

```sh title="Run your application locally"
$ yarn dev
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Access to `http://localhost:8787` in your browser after the server has been started, and you can see the message.

Hono helps you to create your Workers application easily and quickly.

## Build

Now, let's create a Slack bot on Cloudflare Workers.

### Separating files

You can create your application in several files instead of writing all endpoints and functions in one file. With Hono, it is able to add routing of child applications to the parent application using the function `app.route()`.

For example, imagine the following Web API application.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

app.get('/posts', (c) => c.text('Posts!'));
app.post('/posts', (c) => c.text('Created!', 201));

export default app;
```

You can add the routes under `/api/v1`.

```ts null {2,6}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import api from './api';

const app = new Hono();

app.route('/api/v1', api);

export default app;
```

It will return `Posts!` when accessing `GET /api/v1/posts`.

The Slack bot will have two child applications called "route" each.

1. `lookup` route will take requests from Slack (sent when a user uses the `/issue` command), and look up the corresponding issue using the GitHub API. This application will be added to `/lookup` in the main application.

2. `webhook` route will be called when an issue changes on GitHub, via a configured webhook. This application will be add to `/webhook` in the main application.

Create the route files in a directory named `routes`.

```sh title="Create new folders and files"
$ mkdir -p src/routes
$ touch src/routes/lookup.ts
$ touch src/routes/webhook.ts
```

Then update the main application.

```ts null {2,3,7,8}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import lookup from './routes/lookup';
import webhook from './routes/webhook';

const app = new Hono();

app.route('/lookup', lookup);
app.route('/webhook', webhook);

export default app;
```

### Defining TypeScript types

Before implementing the actual functions, you need to define the TypeScript types you will use in this project. Create a new file in the application at `src/types.ts` and write the code. `Bindings` is a type that describes the Cloudflare Workers environment variables. `Issue` is a type for a GitHub issue and `User` is a type for a GitHub user. You will need these later.

```ts
export type Bindings = {
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: string
}

export type Issue = {
  html_url: string
  title: string
  body: string
  state: string
  created_at: string
  number: number
  user: User
}

type User = {
  html_url: string
  login: string
  avatar_url: string
}
```

### Creating the lookup route

Start creating the lookup route in `src/routes/lookup.ts`.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

export default app;
```

To understand how you should design this function, you need to understand how Slack slash commands send data to URLs.

According to the [documentation for Slack slash commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands), Slack sends an HTTP POST request to your specified URL, with a `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type. For example, if someone were to type `/issue cloudflare/wrangler#1`, you could expect a data payload in the format:

```txt
token=gIkuvaNzQIHg97ATvDxqgjtO
&team_id=T0001
&team_domain=example
&enterprise_id=E0001
&enterprise_name=Globular%20Construct%20Inc
&channel_id=C2147483705
&channel_name=test
&user_id=U2147483697
&user_name=Steve
&command=/issue
&text=cloudflare/wrangler#1
&response_url=https://hooks.slack.com/commands/1234/5678
&trigger_id=13345224609.738474920.8088930838d88f008e0
```

Given this payload body, you need to parse it, and get the value of the `text` key. With that `text`, for example, `cloudflare/wrangler#1`, you can parse that string into known piece of data (`owner`, `repo`, and `issue_number`), and use it to make a request to GitHub‚Äôs API, to retrieve the issue data.

With Slack slash commands, you can respond to a slash command by returning structured data as the response to the incoming slash command. In this case, you should use the response from GitHub‚Äôs API to present a formatted version of the GitHub issue, including pieces of data like the title of the issue, who created it, and the date it was created. Slack‚Äôs new [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) framework will allow you to return a detailed message response, by constructing text and image blocks with the data from GitHub‚Äôs API.

#### Parsing slash commands

To begin, the `lookup` route should parse the messages coming from Slack. As previously mentioned, the Slack API sends an HTTP POST in URL Encoded format. You can get the variable `text` by parsing it with `c.req.json()`.

```ts null {5,6,7,8,9,10}
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { text } = await c.req.parseBody();
	if (typeof text !== 'string') {
		return c.notFound();
	}
});

export default app;
```

Given a `text` variable, that contains text like `cloudflare/wrangler#1`, you should parse that text, and get the individual parts from it for use with GitHub‚Äôs API: `owner`, `repo`, and `issue_number`.

To do this, create a new file in your application, at `src/utils/github.ts`. This file will contain a number of ‚Äúutility‚Äù functions for working with GitHub‚Äôs API. The first of these will be a string parser, called `parseGhIssueString`:

```ts
const ghIssueRegex = /(?<owner>[\w.-]*)\/(?<repo>[\w.-]*)\#(?<issue_number>\d*)/;

export const parseGhIssueString = (text: string) => {
	const match = text.match(ghIssueRegex);
	return match ? match.groups ?? {} : {};
};
```

`parseGhIssueString` takes in a `text` input, matches it against `ghIssueRegex`, and if a match is found, returns the `groups` object from that match, making use of the `owner`, `repo`, and `issue_number` capture groups defined in the regex. By exporting this function from `src/utils/github.ts`, you can make use of it back in `src/handlers/lookup.ts`:

```ts null {2,12}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { parseGhIssueString } from '../utils/github';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { text } = await c.req.parseBody();
	if (typeof text !== 'string') {
		return c.notFound();
	}

	const { owner, repo, issue_number } = parseGhIssueString(text);
});

export default app;
```

#### Making requests to GitHub‚Äôs API

With this data, you can make your first API lookup to GitHub. Again, make a new function in `src/utils/github.ts`, to make a `fetch` request to the GitHub API for the issue data:

```ts null {8,9,10,11,12}
const ghIssueRegex = /(?<owner>[\w.-]*)\/(?<repo>[\w.-]*)\#(?<issue_number>\d*)/;

export const parseGhIssueString = (text: string) => {
  const match = text.match(ghIssueRegex)
  return match ? match.groups ?? {} : {}
}

export const fetchGithubIssue = (owner: string, repo: string, issue_number: string) => {
  const url = `https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${issue_number}`
  const headers = { 'User-Agent': 'simple-worker-slack-bot' }
  return fetch(url, { headers })
}
```

Back in `src/handlers/lookup.ts`, use `fetchGitHubIssue` to make a request to GitHub‚Äôs API, and parse the response:

```ts null {2,3,14,15}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { fetchGithubIssue, parseGhIssueString } from '../utils/github';
import { Issue } from '../types';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { text } = await c.req.parseBody();
	if (typeof text !== 'string') {
		return c.notFound();
	}

	const { owner, repo, issue_number } = parseGhIssueString(text);
	const response = await fetchGithubIssue(owner, repo, issue_number);
	const issue = await response.json<Issue>();
});

export default app;
```

#### Constructing a Slack message

After you have received a response back from GitHub‚Äôs API, the final step is to construct a Slack message with the issue data, and return it to the user. The final result will look something like this:

![A successful Slack Message will have the components listed below](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/issue-slack-message.png)

You can see four different pieces in the above screenshot:

1. The first line (bolded) links to the issue, and shows the issue title
2. The following lines (including code snippets) are the issue body
3. The last line of text shows the issue status, the issue creator (with a link to the user‚Äôs GitHub profile), and the creation date for the issue
4. The profile picture of the issue creator, on the right-hand side

The previously mentioned [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) framework will help take the issue data (in the structure lined out in [GitHub‚Äôs REST API documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/)) and format it into something like the above screenshot.

Create another file, `src/utils/slack.ts`, to contain the function `constructGhIssueSlackMessage`, a function for taking issue data, and turning it into a collection of blocks. Blocks are JavaScript objects that Slack will use to format the message:

```ts
import { Issue } from '../types';

export const constructGhIssueSlackMessage = (
	issue: Issue,
	issue_string: string,
	prefix_text?: string
) => {
	const issue_link = `<${issue.html_url}|${issue_string}>`;
	const user_link = `<${issue.user.html_url}|${issue.user.login}>`;
	const date = new Date(Date.parse(issue.created_at)).toLocaleDateString();

	const text_lines = [
		prefix_text,
		`*${issue.title} - ${issue_link}*`,
		issue.body,
		`*${issue.state}* - Created by ${user_link} on ${date}`,
	];
};
```

Slack messages accept a variant of Markdown, which supports bold text via asterisks (`*bolded text*`), and links in the format `<https://yoururl.com|Display Text>`.

Given that format, construct `issue_link`, which takes the `html_url` property from the GitHub API `issue` data (in format `https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1`), and the `issue_string` sent from the Slack slash command, and combines them into a clickable link in the Slack message.

`user_link` is similar, using `issue.user.html_url` (in the format `https://github.com/signalnerve`, a GitHub user) and the user‚Äôs GitHub username (`issue.user.login`), to construct a clickable link to the GitHub user.

Finally, parse `issue.created_at`, an ISO 8601 string, convert it into an instance of a JavaScript `Date`, and turn it into a formatted string, in the format `MM/DD/YY`.

With those variables in place, `text_lines` is an array of each line of text for the Slack message. The first line is the **issue title** and the **issue link**, the second is the **issue body**, and the final line is the **issue state** (for example, open or closed), the **user link**, and the **creation date**.

With the text constructed, you can finally construct your Slack message, returning an array of blocks for Slack‚Äôs [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit). In this case, there is only have one block: a [section](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/blocks#section) block with Markdown text, and an accessory image of the user who created the issue. Return that single block inside of an array, to complete the `constructGhIssueSlackMessage` function:

```ts null {15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28}
import { Issue } from '../types'

export const constructGhIssueSlackMessage = (issue: Issue, issue_string: string, prefix_text?: string) => {
  const issue_link = `<${issue.html_url}|${issue_string}>`
  const user_link = `<${issue.user.html_url}|${issue.user.login}>`
  const date = new Date(Date.parse(issue.created_at)).toLocaleDateString()

  const text_lines = [
    prefix_text,
    `*${issue.title} - ${issue_link}*`,
    issue.body,
    `*${issue.state}* - Created by ${user_link} on ${date}`
  ]

  return [
    {
      type: 'section',
      text: {
        type: 'mrkdwn',
        text: text_lines.join('\n')
      },
      accessory: {
        type: 'image',
        image_url: issue.user.avatar_url,
        alt_text: issue.user.login
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Finishing the lookup route

In `src/handlers/lookup.ts`, use `constructGhIssueSlackMessage` to construct `blocks`, and return them as a new response with `c.json()` when the slash command is called:

```ts null {3,17,18,19,20,21,22}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { fetchGithubIssue, parseGhIssueString } from '../utils/github';
import { constructGhIssueSlackMessage } from '../utils/slack';
import { Issue } from '../types';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { text } = await c.req.parseBody();
	if (typeof text !== 'string') {
		return c.notFound();
	}

	const { owner, repo, issue_number } = parseGhIssueString(text);
	const response = await fetchGithubIssue(owner, repo, issue_number);
	const issue = await response.json<Issue>();
	const blocks = constructGhIssueSlackMessage(issue, text);

	return c.json({
		blocks,
		response_type: 'in_channel',
	});
});

export default app;
```

One additional parameter passed into the response is `response_type`. By default, responses to slash commands are ephemeral, meaning that they are only seen by the user who writes the slash command. Passing a `response_type` of `in_channel`, as seen above, will cause the response to appear for all users in the channel.

If you would like the messages to remain private, remove the `response_type` line. This will cause `response_type` to default to `ephemeral`.

#### Handling errors

The `lookup` route is almost complete, but there are a number of errors that can occur in the route, such as parsing the body from Slack, getting the issue from GitHub, or constructing the Slack message itself. Although Hono applications can handle errors without having to do anything, you can customize the response returned in the following way.

```ts null {25,26,27,28,29,30}
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { fetchGithubIssue, parseGhIssueString } from '../utils/github'
import { constructGhIssueSlackMessage } from '../utils/slack'
import { Issue } from '../types'

const app = new Hono()

app.post('/', async (c) => {
  const { text } = await c.req.parseBody()
  if (typeof text !== 'string') {
    return c.notFound()
  }

  const { owner, repo, issue_number } = parseGhIssueString(text)
  const response = await fetchGithubIssue(owner, repo, issue_number)
  const issue = await response.json<Issue>()
  const blocks = constructGhIssueSlackMessage(issue, text)

  return c.json({
    blocks,
    response_type: 'in_channel'
  })
})

app.onError((_e, c) => {
	return c.text(
		"Uh-oh! We couldn't find the issue you provided. " +
			'We can only find public issues in the following format: `owner/repo#issue_number`.'
	);
});

export default app
```

### Creating the webhook route

You are now halfway through implementing the routes for your Workers application. In implementing the next route, `src/routes/webhook.ts`, you will re-use a lot of the code that you have already written for the lookup route.

At the beginning of this tutorial, you configured a GitHub webhook to track any events related to issues in your repository. When an issue is opened, for example, the function corresponding to the path `/webhook` on your Workers application should take the data sent to it from GitHub, and post a new message in the configured Slack channel.

In `src/routes/webhook.ts`, define a blank Hono application. The difference from the `lookup` route is that the `Bindings` is passed as a generics for the `new Hono()`. This is necessary to give the appropriate TypeScript type to `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` which will be used later.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { Bindings } from '../types';

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

export default app;
```

Much like with the `lookup` route, you will need to parse the incoming payload inside of `request`, get the relevant issue data from it (refer to [the GitHub API documentation on `IssueEvent`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#issuesevent) for the full payload schema), and send a formatted message to Slack to indicate what has changed. The final version will look something like this:

![A successful Webhook Message example](~/assets/images/workers/tutorials/slackbot/webhook_example.png)

Compare this message format to the format returned when a user uses the `/issue` slash command. You will see that there is only one actual difference between the two: the addition of an action text on the first line, in the format `An issue was $action:`. This action, which is sent as part of the `IssueEvent` from GitHub, will be used as you construct a very familiar looking collection of blocks using Slack‚Äôs Block Kit.

#### Parsing event data

To start filling out the route, parse the request body formatted JSON into an object and construct some helper variables:

```ts null {2,6,7,8,9,10}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { constructGhIssueSlackMessage } from '../utils/slack';

const app = new Hono();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { action, issue, repository } = await c.req.json();
	const prefix_text = `An issue was ${action}:`;
	const issue_string = `${repository.owner.login}/${repository.name}#${issue.number}`;
});

export default app;
```

An `IssueEvent`, the payload sent from GitHub as part of your webhook configuration, includes an `action` (what happened to the issue: for example, it was opened, closed, locked, etc.), the `issue` itself, and the `repository`, among other things.

Use `c.req.json()` to convert the payload body of the request from JSON into a plain JS object. Use ES6 destructuring to set `action`, `issue` and `repository` as variables you can use in your code. `prefix_text` is a string indicating what happened to the issue, and `issue_string` is the familiar string `owner/repo#issue_number` that you have seen before: while the `lookup` route directly used the text sent from Slack to fill in `issue_string`, you will construct it directly based on the data passed in the JSON payload.

#### Constructing and sending a Slack message

The messages your Slack bot sends back to your Slack channel from the `lookup` and `webhook` routes are incredibly similar. Because of this, you can re-use the existing `constructGhIssueSlackMessage` to continue populating `src/handlers/webhook.ts`. Import the function from `src/utils/slack.ts`, and pass the issue data into it:

```ts null {10}
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { constructGhIssueSlackMessage } from '../utils/slack'

const app = new Hono()

app.post('/', async (c) => {
  const { action, issue, repository } = await c.req.json()
  const prefix_text = `An issue was ${action}:`
  const issue_string = `${repository.owner.login}/${repository.name}#${issue.number}`
  const blocks = constructGhIssueSlackMessage(issue, issue_string, prefix_text)
})

export default app;
```

Importantly, the usage of `constructGhIssueSlackMessage` in this handler adds one additional argument to the function, `prefix_text`. Update the corresponding function inside of `src/utils/slack.ts`, adding `prefix_text` to the collection of `text_lines` in the message block, if it has been passed in to the function.

Add a utility function, `compact`, which takes an array, and filters out any `null` or `undefined` values from it. This function will be used to remove `prefix_text` from `text_lines` if it has not actually been passed in to the function, such as when called from `src/handlers/lookup.ts`. The full (and final) version of the `src/utils/slack.ts` looks like this:

```ts null {3,26}
import { Issue } from '../types';

const compact = (array: unknown[]) => array.filter((el) => el);

export const constructGhIssueSlackMessage = (
	issue: Issue,
	issue_string: string,
	prefix_text?: string
) => {
	const issue_link = `<${issue.html_url}|${issue_string}>`;
	const user_link = `<${issue.user.html_url}|${issue.user.login}>`;
	const date = new Date(Date.parse(issue.created_at)).toLocaleDateString();

	const text_lines = [
		prefix_text,
		`*${issue.title} - ${issue_link}*`,
		issue.body,
		`*${issue.state}* - Created by ${user_link} on ${date}`,
	];

	return [
		{
			type: 'section',

				type: 'mrkdwn',
				text: compact(text_lines).join('\n'),

Back in `src/handlers/webhook.ts`, the `blocks` that are returned from `constructGhIssueSlackMessage` become the body in a new `fetch` request, an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL. Once that request completes, return a response with status code `200`, and the body text `"OK"`:

```ts null {13,14,15,16,17,18,19}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { constructGhIssueSlackMessage } from '../utils/slack';
import { Bindings } from '../types';

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { action, issue, repository } = await c.req.json();
	const prefix_text = `An issue was ${action}:`;
	const issue_string = `${repository.owner.login}/${repository.name}#${issue.number}`;
	const blocks = constructGhIssueSlackMessage(issue, issue_string, prefix_text);

	const fetchResponse = await fetch(c.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
		body: JSON.stringify({ blocks }),
		method: 'POST',
		headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
	});

	return c.text('OK');
});

export default app;
```

The constant `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` represents the Slack Webhook URL that you created all the way back in the [Incoming Webhook](/workers/tutorials/build-a-slackbot/#incoming-webhook) section of this tutorial.

:::caution


Since this webhook allows developers to post directly to your Slack channel, keep it secret.


:::

To use this constant inside of your codebase, use the [`wrangler secret`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#secret) command:

```sh title="Set the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL secret"
$ npx wrangler secret put SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
Enter a secret value: https://hooks.slack.com/services/abc123
```

#### Handling errors

Similarly to the `lookup` route, the `webhook` route should include some basic error handling. Unlike `lookup`, which sends responses directly back into Slack, if something goes wrong with your webhook, it may be useful to actually generate an erroneous response, and return it to GitHub.

To do this, write the custom error handler with `app.onError()` and return a new response with a status code of `500`. The final version of `src/routes/webhook.ts` looks like this:

```ts null {24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31}
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { constructGhIssueSlackMessage } from '../utils/slack';
import { Bindings } from '../types';

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>();

app.post('/', async (c) => {
	const { action, issue, repository } = await c.req.json();
	const prefix_text = `An issue was ${action}:`;
	const issue_string = `${repository.owner.login}/${repository.name}#${issue.number}`;
	const blocks = constructGhIssueSlackMessage(issue, issue_string, prefix_text);

	const fetchResponse = await fetch(c.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, {
		body: JSON.stringify({ blocks }),
		method: 'POST',
		headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
	});

	if (!fetchResponse.ok) throw new Error();

	return c.text('OK');
});

app.onError((_e, c) => {
	return c.json(
		{
			message: 'Unable to handle webhook',
		},
		500
	);
});

export default app
```

## Deploy

By completing the preceding steps, you have finished writing the code for your Slack bot. You can now deploy your application.

Wrangler has built-in support for bundling, uploading, and releasing your Cloudflare Workers application. To do this, run the following command which will build and deploy your code.

<Tabs> <TabItem label="npm">

```sh title="Deploy your application"
$ npm run deploy
```

</TabItem> <TabItem label="yarn">

```sh title="Deploy your application"
$ yarn deploy
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Deploying your Workers application should now cause issue updates to start appearing in your Slack channel, as the GitHub webhook can now successfully reach your Workers webhook route:

## Related resources

In this tutorial, you built and deployed a Cloudflare Workers application that can respond to GitHub webhook events, and allow GitHub API lookups within Slack. If you would like to review the full source code for this application, you can find the repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/yusukebe/workers-slack-bot).

If you want to get started building your own projects, review the existing list of [Quickstart templates](/workers/get-started/quickstarts/).
