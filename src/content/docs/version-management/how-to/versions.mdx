## Create version

<Render file="enable-default-creation" />

If you need to test out different implementations of configurations at the same time or multiple types of changes, create a new version of your zone.

To create a new version:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Version Management**.
4. On an existing version, select **Clone**. This will copy over all configurations from that version.
5. If needed, you can also **Edit Description** to provide more detail about the purpose of this version.

***

## Change configurations in a version

Your zone configurations are split up into two areas: **Global Configuration** and different versions.

* Global Configuration controls the configurations of a zone that is not available for versioning and, when changed, automatically apply to all versions of your zone.
* Version configurations update configurations of a zone that is available for versioning and are:
  * Editable when not applied to a [read-only environment](/version-management/reference/read-only-environments/).
  * Applied when [associated with an environment](/version-management/how-to/environments/#change-environment-version).

:::note


To use the API for a different version, you will need to use a different zone ID.


:::

### Editable versions

<Render file="edit-version" />

:::note


To change the version associated with an environment, you need to update configurations on the [Environment](/version-management/how-to/environments/#change-environment-version) itself.


:::

### Read-only versions

<Render file="production-read-only-default" /> <br/>

In order to change configurations in a version associated with a [read-only environment](/version-management/reference/read-only-environments/), either:

* [Change the environment version](/version-management/how-to/environments/#change-environment-version) to another version and then make changes to your version.
* [Edit](/version-management/how-to/environments/#edit-environment) the environment's configurations to remove the **Read-only environment** configuration. Then, promote a new version to this environment.

## View metrics

Once you begin [sending traffic](/version-management/reference/traffic-filters/) to an environment with a version applied, you can also view metrics about what happens to that traffic.

To view metrics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Version Management**.
3. On an existing version, select **View Metrics**.

:::note

You will only see metrics for the specific version that is active in the Cloudflare dashboard during the time frame that you select.
