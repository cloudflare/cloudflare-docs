## Disable Version Management

:::caution


When you disable Zone Versioning, all your zone configurations will revert to those in your **Version Zero**.


:::

To disable Zone Versioning:

1. Confirm that **Version Zero** has the correct configurations for your zone:

   1. Use the [comparison feature](/version-management/how-to/compare-versions/) to view the differences between your current **Production** version and **Version Zero**.

   2. If there are differences, make changes to **Version Zero** so it matches your current **Production** version.

   3. [Promote](/version-management/how-to/environments/#promote-a-version) **Version Zero** to your **Production** environment.

   4. Confirm that your new **Production** environment functions as expected.

2. Send a `GET` request to the `/zones/{zone_id}/environments` endpoint.

   ```bash
   curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/environments" \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

   In the response, save the following values:

   * The environment `ref` of every rule

3. Using the `ref` of those environments, send a `DELETE` request to the `/zones/{zone_id}/environments/{ref}` endpoint for each environment.

   ```bash
   curl --request DELETE \
   "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/environments/{ref}" \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

4. Then, send a `GET` request to find all HTTP applications (or versions of your zone).

   ```bash
   curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/http_applications" \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

   Save the `id` of each HTTP application.

5. Using the `id` of those HTTP applications, send `DELETE` requests for every application.

   ```bash
   curl --request DELETE \
   "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/http_applications/{http_application_id}" \
   --header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
   --header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>"
   ```

Once all these steps are completed, Zone Versioning will go back to its original landing page.
