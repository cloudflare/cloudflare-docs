When you use Version Management, you can edit various configurations, such as [WAF custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) and [Cache](/cache/).

Generally, you are allowed to edit all zone-level configurations except for the following:

* [DNS](/dns/)
* [Spectrum](/spectrum/)
* Traffic ([Load Balancing](/load-balancing/), [Waiting Rooms](/waiting-room/), Health Checks, and more)
* [Zero Trust](/cloudflare-one/) and Access policies
* [SSL certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/) (though you can test these with a separate [staging certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/staging-environment/) feature)

:::note


For the most up-to-date list of these configurations, start [editing configurations within a version](/version-management/how-to/versions/#change-configurations-in-a-version) in the Cloudflare dashboard.
