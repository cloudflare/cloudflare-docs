import { Render } from "~/components"

When an environment is read-only, versions deployed to this environment will permanently become read-only. This configuration protects sensitive environments from accidental changes.

**Version Zero** is an exception to this rule and is always editable.

<Render file="production-read-only-default" /> <br/>

For similar reasons, some organizations may make **Staging** a read-only environment. Otherwise, another member of your account could make changes to a version in **Staging** *after* your organization has performed the validation tests prior to promoting to **Production**. Without having a read-only **Staging** environment, this change could be released into **Production** without testing and might cause an issue with live traffic.

To change the read-only status of an environment, [edit the environment](/version-management/how-to/environments/#edit-environment).
