description: Use load balancing analytics to evaluate traffic flow, assess the
  health of endpoints, and review health changes over time.

import { Details } from "~/components"

Using load balancing analytics, you can:

* Evaluate traffic flow.
* Assess the health status of endpoints in your pools.
* Review changes in pools and pool health over time.

:::note


Load balancing analytics are only available to customers on paid plans (Pro, Business, and Enterprise).


:::

## Dashboard Analytics

### Overview metrics

To view **Overview** metrics for your load balancer, go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing Analytics**.

These metrics show the number of requests routed to specific pools within a load balancer, helping you:

* Evaluate the effects of adding or removing a pool.
* Decide when to create new pools.
* Plan for peak traffic demands and future infrastructure needs.

Add additional filters for specific pools, times, regions, and endpoints.

:::note


Load balancing <strong>requests</strong> are the number of uncached requests made by your load balancer. By default, Cloudflare caches resolved IP addresses for up to five seconds.


:::

### Latency

**Latency** metrics show an interactive map, helping you identify regions with **Unhealthy** or **Slow** pools.

To view latency information for your load balancer, go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing Analytics** > **Latency**.

### Logs

**Logs** provide a history of all endpoint status changes and how they affect your load balancing pools. Load Balancing only logs events that represent a status change for an endpoint, from healthy to unhealthy or vice versa.

To access logs in the dashboard, go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing Analytics**. You can also access healthcheck logs [using the API](/api/operations/load-balancer-healthcheck-events-list-healthcheck-events).

## GraphQL Analytics

For more flexibility, get load balancing metrics directly from the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/).

Get started with a sample query:


<Details header="Requests per pool">

This query shows the number of requests each pool receives from each location in Cloudflare's global network.

```graphql title="Query"
{
  viewer {
    zones(filter: {zoneTag: "your Zone ID"}) {
         loadBalancingRequestsAdaptiveGroups(
            limit: 100,
            filter: {
                datetime_geq: "2021-06-26T00:00:00Z",
                datetime_leq: "2021-06-26T03:00:00Z",
                lbName:"lb.example.com"
            },
            orderBy: [datetimeFifteenMinutes_DESC]
        ) {
          count
          dimensions {
            datetimeFifteenMinutes
            coloCode
            selectedPoolName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="Response (truncated)"
{
    "data": {
        "viewer": {
            "zones": [
                {
                    "loadBalancingRequestsAdaptiveGroups": [
                        {
                            "count": 4,
                            "dimensions": {
                                "coloCode": "IAD",
                                "datetimeFifteenMinutes": "2021-06-26T00:45:00Z",
                                "selectedPoolName": "us-east"
                            }
                        },
                        ...
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```


</Details>


<Details header="Requests per data center">

This query shows the weighted, round-trip time (RTT) measurement (`avgRttMs`) for monitor requests from a specific data center (for example, Singapore or `SIN`) to each pool in a specific load balancer.

:::caution

Note that `avgRttMs` refers to the round-trip time that is measured by the monitors and used in steering decisions. `avgRttMs` is different from the raw RTT for individual requests that reach the Cloudflare network.
