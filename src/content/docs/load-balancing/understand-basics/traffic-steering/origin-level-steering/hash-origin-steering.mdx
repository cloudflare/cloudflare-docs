**Hash steering** guides Cloudflare to send requests to endpoints based on a combination of [endpoint weights](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/#weights) and previous requests from that IP address. Ensures requests from the same IP address will hit the same endpoint, but actual traffic distribution may differ from endpoint weights.
