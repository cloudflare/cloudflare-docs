## EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) support

<GlossaryTooltip term="EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)">EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)</GlossaryTooltip> support provides customers with more control over location-based steering during gray-clouded DNS resolutions and can be used for proximity or geo (country) steering.

Customers can configure their load balancer using the `location_strategy` parameter, which includes the properties `prefer_ecs` and `mode`.

`prefer_ecs` determines whether the ECS GeoIP should be preferred as the authoritative location.

| Type          | Description                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"always"`    | Always prefers ECS.                                                                     |
| `"never"`     | Never prefers ECS.                                                                      |
| `"proximity"` | Prefers ECS only when `steering_policy="proximity"`.                                    |
| `"geo"`       | Prefers ECS only when `steering_policy="geo"` and only supports country-level steering. |

`mode` determines the authoritative location when ECS is not preferred, does not exist in the request, or its GeoIP lookup is unsuccessful.

| Type            | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"pop"`         | Uses the Cloudflare PoP location.                                                                               |
| `"resolver_ip"` | Uses the DNS resolver GeoIP location. If the GeoIP lookup is unsuccessful, it uses the Cloudflare PoP location. |

:::note


ECS support applies to DNS-only load balancers.
