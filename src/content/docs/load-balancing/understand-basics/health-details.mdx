When we talk about dynamic load balancing, that means your load balancer only directs requests to endpoints that can handle the traffic.

But how does your load balancer *know* which endpoints can handle the traffic? We determine that through a system of monitors, health monitors, and pools.

***

## Dynamic load balancing

Dynamic load balancing happens through a combination of <GlossaryTooltip term="pool" link="/load-balancing/pools/">pools</GlossaryTooltip>, <GlossaryTooltip term="monitor" link="/load-balancing/monitors/">monitors</GlossaryTooltip>, and <GlossaryTooltip term="health check">health checks</GlossaryTooltip>.

## How an endpoint becomes unhealthy

<GlossaryDefinition term="health check" prepend="Health checks are " />

<Render file="health-check-regions" />

:::note


If **Health Monitor Regions** for a pool is set to **All Data Centers (Enterprise)**, pool health is determined by a majority of data centers.


:::

Load balancing analytics and logs will only show global health changes.

For greater accuracy and consistency when changing endpoint health status, you can also set the `consecutive_up` and `consecutive_down` parameters via the [Create Monitor API endpoint](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-monitors-create-monitor). To change from healthy to unhealthy, an endpoint will have to be marked healthy a consecutive number of times (specified by `consecutive_down`). The same applies — from unhealthy to healthy — for `consecutive_up`.

***

## How a pool becomes unhealthy

When an [individual endpoint becomes unhealthy](#how-an-endpoint-becomes-unhealthy), that may affect the health status of any associated pools (visible in the dashboard):

* **Healthy**: All endpoints are healthy.
* **Degraded**: At least one endpoint is unhealthy, but the pool is still considered healthy and could be receiving traffic.
* **Critical**: The pool has fallen below the number of available endpoints specified in its **Health Threshold** and will not receive traffic from your load balancer (unless other pools are also unhealthy and this pool is marked as the [**Fallback Pool**](#fallback-pools)).
* **Health unknown**: There are either no monitors attached to pool endpoints or the monitors have not yet determined endpoint health.
* **No health**: Reserved for your load balancer's [**Fallback Pool**](#fallback-pools).

:::note


1) When no monitor is attached to a pool, the health status is not considered during steering.
2) Origins are considered down when monitoring is enabled, but the health status is still unknown.
3) If there are no monitors, a fallback pool is still required, but it will only be used if all the default pools have origins with FQDN addresses that cannot be resolved.

## How a load balancer becomes unhealthy

When one or more pools become unhealthy, your load balancer might also show a different status in the dashboard:

* **Healthy**: All pools are healthy.
* **Degraded**: At least one pool is unhealthy, but traffic is not yet going to the [Fallback Pool](#fallback-pools).
* **Critical**: All pools are unhealthy and traffic is going to the [Fallback Pool](#fallback-pools).

If a load balancer reaches **Critical** health and the pool serving as your fallback pool is also disabled:

* If Cloudflare proxies your hostname, you will see a 530 HTTP/1016 Origin DNS failure.
* If Cloudflare does not proxy your hostname, you will see the SOA record.
