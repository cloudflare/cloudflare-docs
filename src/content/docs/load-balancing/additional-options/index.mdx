Beyond [creating a simple load balancer](/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/), you may want to further customize how your load balancer routes traffic or integrate your load balancer with other Cloudflare products.

## Customize load balancer behavior

* Route traffic according to characteristics of each request by [creating custom rules](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/)
* Protect at-risk endpoints from reaching failover by [setting up load shedding](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-shedding/)
* Take endpoints out of rotation for [planned maintenance](/load-balancing/additional-options/planned-maintenance/)

## Integrate with other Cloudflare products

* Bring load balancing to your TCP or UDP applications with [Cloudflare Spectrum](/load-balancing/additional-options/spectrum/)
* Further secure endpoint access with [Cloudflare Tunnel](/load-balancing/additional-options/cloudflare-tunnel/)

## Integrate with 3rd parties

* Increase visibility by [sending health monitor notifications to PagerDuty](/load-balancing/additional-options/pagerduty-integration/)
