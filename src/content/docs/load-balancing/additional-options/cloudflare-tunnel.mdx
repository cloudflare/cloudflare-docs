    content: Route traffic through a Cloudflare Tunnel

---

Cloudflare Tunnel (formerly Argo Tunnel) establishes a secure outbound connection which runs in your infrastructure to connect the applications and machines to Cloudflare.

For more details on how to use Load Balancing with Cloudflare Tunnel and public hostnames, refer to [Route tunnel traffic using a load balancer](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/routing-to-tunnel/lb/). For using private IPs instead, refer to [Set up private IPs with Tunnel](/load-balancing/local-traffic-management/ltm-tunnels-setup/).
