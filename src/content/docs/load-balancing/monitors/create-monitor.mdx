## Create a monitor

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

**Set up the monitor**

<Render file="monitor-create" />

**Prepare your servers**

<Render file="monitor-prepare-server" />

**Attach the monitor to a pool**

Once your monitor is created, you need to attach it to a pool:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.

2. Select **Manage Pools**.

3. On a specific pool, select **Edit**.

4. Update the following information:

   - **Monitor**: Select your monitor.
   - **Health Monitor Regions:** Specifies geographic regions from which Cloudflare should send health monitor requests. Because of [how monitors check pool health](/load-balancing/monitors/#health-monitor-regions), selecting multiple regions could increase the load on your servers.
   - **Notification E-mail:** Contains email addresses that receive notifications (individual, mailing list address, PagerDuty address).

5. Select **Save**. The status of your health monitor will be _unknown_ until the results of the first check are available.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

**Set up the monitor**

<Render file="monitor-create-api" />

**Prepare your servers**

<Render file="monitor-prepare-server" />

**Attach the monitor to a pool**

Once your monitor is created, save its `id` property. Include this value in the `monitor` parameter when [creating your pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool).
