Health monitor requests that result in a status change for an endpoint are recorded as events in the Load Balancing event logs.

:::note


Health monitors associated with load balancers are different from standalone [Health Checks](/health-checks/). For an overview of how the Cloudflare Load Balancing solution works, refer to [Load Balancing components](/load-balancing/understand-basics/load-balancing-components/).

## Properties

For an up-to-date list of monitor properties, refer to [Monitor properties](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-monitors-list-monitors) in our API documentation.

***

## Create monitors

For step-by-step guidance, refer to [Create monitors](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/).

***

## Health monitor regions

When you [attach a monitor to a pool](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/#create-a-monitor), you can select multiple regions to increase reporting accuracy.

### Configurations

<Render file="monitor-health-check-regions-options" />

***

## Host header prioritization

The host headers used on health monitor requests can be configured either [on the monitor itself](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/) or on the [endpoints within a pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/).

When a host header is specified both on the monitor and on the endpoint, the host header configured on the endpoint takes precedence over the host header configured on the monitor.

When no host header is specified, Cloudflare uses the **Endpoint Address** configured on the endpoints as the host header for the health monitor requests.

For more details, refer to [Override HTTP Host headers](/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/).

## API commands

The Cloudflare API supports the following commands for monitors. Examples are given for user-level endpoint but apply to the account-level endpoint as well.
