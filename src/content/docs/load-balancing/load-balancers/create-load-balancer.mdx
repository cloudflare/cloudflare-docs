For more details about load balancers, refer to [Load balancers](/load-balancing/load-balancers/).

## Create a load balancer

<Render file="load-balancer-create" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Sharing your load balancer with other sites

You can share your load balancer with other sites in your account by [creating a canonical name (`CNAME`) record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/). This is useful for sharing configurations with multiple other domains so you do not have to create new load balancers for each site.

You can also configure separate load balancers for each domain and reuse monitors and pools. This is especially useful for changing the failover order for different domains, such as when your `example.co.uk` server has a different failover priority from `example.com` or `example.com.au`.

:::note


Sharing load balancers across sites is only supported if the target zone is on a [full DNS setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/). It is not supported if the target zone is on a `CNAME` setup.

## Edit a load balancer

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To edit a load balancer in the dashboard:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.
2. On a specific load balancer, click **Edit**.
3. While going through the [creation workflow](#create-a-load-balancer), update settings as needed.
4. On the **Review** step, click **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

When you edit a load balancer with the API, your request type depends on how much you want to edit.

To update specific settings without having to resubmit the entire configuration, use a [PATCH](/api/operations/load-balancers-patch-load-balancer) request. For broader changes, use a [PUT](/api/operations/load-balancers-update-load-balancer) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Delete a load balancer

If you delete or disable a load balancer, your endpoint's response to requests will depend on your [existing DNS records](/load-balancing/load-balancers/dns-records/#disabling-a-load-balancer).

<Tabs> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To delete a load balancer in the dashboard:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.
2. On a specific load balancer, click **Delete**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To delete a load balancer using the API, send a [DELETE](/api/operations/load-balancers-delete-load-balancer) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Set up alerts

You can configure alerts to receive notifications for changes in the health status of your pools or endpoints.

<AvailableNotifications product="Load Balancing" notificationFilter="Load Balancing Health Alert" />

<Render file="get-started" product="notifications" />
