## Create a pool

<Tabs> <TabItem label="dashboard">

<Render file="pool-create" />

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

<Render file="pool-create-api" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Edit a pool

<Tabs> <TabItem label="dashboard">

To edit a pool in the dashboard:

1. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.
2. Click **Manage Pools**.
3. On a specific pool, click **Edit**.
4. Update settings as needed.
5. Click **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="api">

When you edit a pool with the API, your request type depends on how much you want to edit.

To update specific settings without having to resubmit the entire configuration, use a [PATCH](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-pools-patch-pool) request. For broader changes, use a [PUT](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-pools-update-pool) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

***

## Delete a pool

You cannot delete pools that are in use by load balancers. This includes [geo steering regions](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/geo-steering/#region-steering) pools as well as [fallback pools](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/#fallback-pools).

If you get an error when trying to delete a pool, consider the hostnames listed in the error and [edit the respective load balancers](/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/), making sure to remove all references to the pool.

:::note

If the pool is referenced by geo steering, the configuration is **not** automatically removed when you change to a different **Traffic Steering** method. To make sure you remove it, select **Geo Steering**, remove the pool, and then apply and save any other necessary changes.
