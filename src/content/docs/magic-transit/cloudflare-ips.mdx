In addition to using Magic Transit with your own IP address, you can use Magic Transit with a Cloudflare-owned IP address. This option is helpful for users who do not meet the `/24` <GlossaryTooltip term="prefix">prefix</GlossaryTooltip> length requirements or who want to protect a smaller network.

To protect your network using a Cloudflare IP address, contact your account manager. After receiving your IP address, you will need to:

- [Create a tunnel](/magic-transit/how-to/configure-tunnels/).
- [Set up static routes](/magic-transit/how-to/configure-static-routes).
- [Configure health checks](/magic-transit/how-to/run-endpoint-health-checks).
- Confirm [tunnel](/magic-transit/how-to/tunnel-health-checks/) and endpoint health checks were properly configured.
- Update your infrastructure at your own pace to use the allocated Cloudflare IPs.

When you use a Cloudflare-owned IP space, you do not need a <GlossaryTooltip term="letter of agency" link="/magic-transit/get-started/#draft-letter-of-agency">Letter of Agency (LOA)</GlossaryTooltip>. You can skip this step from the Prerequisites page.
