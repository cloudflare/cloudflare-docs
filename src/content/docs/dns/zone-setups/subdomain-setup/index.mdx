When you use a subdomain setup, you can manage the [Cloudflare configurations](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) for one or more subdomains separately from those associated with your <GlossaryTooltip term="apex domain">apex domain</GlossaryTooltip>. This means that, on your [account homepage](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/), you would find websites like `example.com` or `blog.example.com` listed as separate <GlossaryTooltip term="DNS zone">zones</GlossaryTooltip>.

:::note
This is different from simply creating a subdomain for a site you already have in Cloudflare. If you do not need separate Cloudflare configuration for your subdomain, refer to [Create a subdomain record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-subdomain/).
:::

You might use this setup when you want to share access to a specific subdomain's settings with different teams, but have stricter controls on your apex domain. For example, a subdomain setup could allow your documentation team to manage the Cloudflare configuration for `docs.example.com`, while preventing them from adjusting any settings on `example.com`.

Subdomain setups are also useful when different subdomains require entirely different settings. For example, you may have different requirements for `docs.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, and `community.example.com`.

## Availability

<FeatureTable id="dns.subdomain_setup" />

:::note
If a domain is listed on the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org), you are able to add subdomains of it as separate zones without the Enterprise plan.
:::

:::caution
Do not apply a domain name to the Public Suffix List for the sole purpose of evading this restriction.
