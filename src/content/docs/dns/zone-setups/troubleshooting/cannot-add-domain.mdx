If you encounter issues [adding a domain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) to Cloudflare, follow these troubleshooting steps.

## 1. Disable DNSSEC

Cloudflare cannot provide authoritative DNS resolution for a domain — a [full setup domain](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) — when **DNSSEC** is enabled at your domain registrar.

If you do not disable **DNSSEC** before changing your nameservers, you might experience the following issues:

- DNS does not resolve after switching to Cloudflare’s nameservers.
- DNS query response status is `SERVFAIL`.
- The domain remains in a [Pending status](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/).

If you experience these issues, refer to [Configuring DNSSEC](/dns/dnssec) and [Troubleshooting DNSSEC](/dns/dnssec/troubleshooting/).

---

## 2. Register the domain

If the issue is with your registrar, you may receive the following error messages:

- `exampledomain.com is not a registered domain (Code: 1049)`
- `We were unable to identify bad.psl-example as a registered domain. Please ensure you are providing the root domain and not any subdomains (e.g., example.com, not subdomain.example.com) (Code: 1099)`
- `Failed to lookup registrar and hosting information of exampledomain.com at this time. Please contact Cloudflare Support or try again later. (Code: 1110)`

If you receive these error messages, make sure that:

- You are providing the apex domain (also known as "root domain", e.g. `example.com`) and not a subdomain (`www.example.com`).
- You domain is fully registered and its registration data lists its nameservers.
- Your domain uses a verified [top-level domain (TLD)](https://publicsuffix.org/list/).

## 3. Resolve DNS for apex domain

Before a domain can be added to Cloudflare, the domain must return `NS` records for valid, working nameservers. `NS` records can be checked via third-party online tools such as [https://www.whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) or via a command-line terminal using a dig command:

```sh
dig +short ns cloudflare.com
```

```sh output

ns3.cloudflare.com.
ns4.cloudflare.com.
ns5.cloudflare.com.
ns6.cloudflare.com.
ns7.cloudflare.com.
```

Additionally, the domain must return a valid `SOA` record when queried. `SOA` records can be checked via third-party online tools such as [https://www.whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) or via a command-line terminal:

```sh
dig +short soa cloudflare.com
```

```sh output

ns3.cloudflare.com. dns.cloudflare.com. 2029202248 10000 2400 604800 300
```

## 4. Check if the domain is restricted at Cloudflare

If Cloudflare has temporary or permanent restrictions on a domain, you will receive the following errors:

- **Error 1105**
  - **Message**: `Error with Cloudflare request: [1105] This zone is temporarily restricted and cannot be added to Cloudflare at this time, please contact Cloudflare Support.`
  - **Cause**: We have seen too many attempts to add a domain to Cloudflare
  - **Resolution**: Wait 3 hours before attempting to re-add the domain to Cloudflare. Support cannot speed up this process.
- \_**Error 1093 or 1116**
  - **Message**: `This zone cannot be added to Cloudflare at this time, please contact Cloudflare Support. (Code: 1093)`
  - **Cause**: You may have entered a subdomain (`www.example.com`) instead of the apex domain (also known as "root domain", e.g. `example.com`).
  - **Resolution**: Verify that you are entering the apex domain. If you are and still experience issues, contact [Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).
- \_**Error 1097**
  - **Message**: `This web property cannot be added to Cloudflare at this time. If you are an Enterprise customer, contact your Customer Success Manager. Otherwise, email abusereply@cloudflare.com with a detailed explanation of your association with this zone. (Code: 1097)`
  - **Resolution**: Contact [abusereply@cloudflare.com](mailto:abusereply@cloudflare.com) with a detailed explanation of your association with this zone.
- **Error: Cannot be found** OR **`<your domain>` is not a registered domain (code: 1049)**
  - This can happen if the domain has not been registered yet. Some domains, like `.gov` domains, have special requirements that require the domain be added first.
  - **Resolution:** Please contact [Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) if you require assistance adding a `.gov` and/or other domains that require manual registration.
