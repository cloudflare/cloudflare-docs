If you initially set up [incoming zone transfers (Cloudflare as secondary)](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/), you can later convert your zone to use a <GlossaryTooltip term="partial setup">partial setup</GlossaryTooltip>.

<Render file="conversion-subdomain-setup-callout" />

Follow the steps below to achieve this conversion.

## 1. Stop transferring the zone

<Render file="secondary-conversion-unlink" />

## 2. Configure your authoritative DNS provider

1. (Optional) If you are also migrating to a new authoritative DNS provider, export a zone file from the previous provider and import it into the new one.
2. At your authoritative DNS provider, create `CNAME` records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net` for every hostname you wish to proxy through Cloudflare.

    <Details header="Example CNAME record at authoritative DNS provider">

    The `CNAME` record for `www.example.com` would be:

    ```txt
    www.example.com CNAME www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
    ```
    </Details>

3. At your authoritative DNS provider, remove any previously existing `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records referencing the hostnames you want to proxy through Cloudflare. For these hostnames, leave only the records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net`.

## 3. Convert your Cloudflare zone

1. Back at your Cloudflare zone, confirm that you have all the `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` [DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) needed for the hostnames you pointed to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net` in the previous step. You can also delete any DNS records that have a different type, as they will no longer resolve once you convert your zone to a partial setup.
2. Use the [Edit Zone endpoint](/api/operations/zones-0-patch) with `type` set to `partial` to convert the zone type. Existing DNS records will not be affected.
3. On [**DNS** > **Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records), get the **Verification TXT Record** and add it at your authoritative DNS provider.

    <Details header="Example verification record">

    A verification record for `sub.example.com` might be:

    | Type | Name                            | Content             |
    | ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
    | TXT  | `cloudflare-verify.sub.example.com` | 966215192-518620144 |

    If your authoritative DNS provider automatically appends DNS record `name` fields with your domain, make sure to only insert `cloudflare-verify` as the record name. Otherwise, it may result in an incorrect record name, such as `cloudflare-verify.sub.example.com.sub.example.com`.

    After creating the record, you can use this [Dig Web Interface link](https://digwebinterface.com/?type=TXT&ns=auth&nameservers=) to search (`dig`) for `cloudflare-verify.<YOUR DOMAIN>` and validate if it is working.

    </Details>

    :::note
    The verification record must remain in place for as long as you want your partial setup to be active on Cloudflare.
    :::

## 4. Update nameservers

At your domain registrar (or parent zone), [update the nameservers](/dns/nameservers/update-nameservers/). In a partial (CNAME) setup, only the nameservers of your external DNS provider should be listed.

    - Remove any `secondary.cloudflare.com` nameservers if you used to have them.
    - If you are also migrating to a new authoritative DNS provider, add your new nameservers.
