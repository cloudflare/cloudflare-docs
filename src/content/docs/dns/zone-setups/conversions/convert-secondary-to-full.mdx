If you initially set up [incoming zone transfers (Cloudflare as secondary)](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/), you can later convert your zone to use a full setup.

Follow the steps below to achieve this conversion.

## 1. Stop transferring the zone

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and zone.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Settings** > **DNS Zone Transfers** and select **Manage linked peers**.
3. Unlink the peer and select **Save**.

## 2. Prepare for the conversion

1. Plan for [DNSSEC settings](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/). If you were previously using [Pre-signed DNSSEC](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/#set-up-pre-signed-dnssec), consider disabling DNSSEC before starting the conversion.
2. Make sure the [proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) of your DNS records are consistently set:

    - If you have [Secondary DNS override](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/proxy-traffic/), confirm each record has the appropriate setting (**Proxied** or **DNS only**).
    - If [Secondary DNS override](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/proxy-traffic/) is disabled, make sure all of your DNS records are listed as **DNS only**.

3. (Optional) For consistency, use the [Update DNS Settings](/api/operations/dns-settings-for-a-zone-update-dns-settings) endpoint to specify SOA record fields according to your needs. Once Cloudflare automatically generates an SOA record for your zone on full setup, the field overrides will be considered.

## 3. Convert your zone

1. Use the [Edit Zone endpoint](/api/operations/zones-0-patch) with `type` set to `full`, to convert the zone type. Existing DNS records will not be affected.
2. Go to [**DNS** > **Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) and take note of your new **Cloudflare Nameservers**.
3. At your domain registrar (or parent zone), [update your nameservers](/dns/nameservers/update-nameservers/). Replace the nameservers ending in `secondary.cloudflare.com` by the ones ending in `ns.cloudflare.com`.

    :::note
    If Cloudflare will be your only primary DNS provider, remove any other nameservers as well.

4. Delete the previous SOA record to make sure Cloudflare generates a new one.
5. (Optional) If Cloudflare was previously not signing your records and you wish to use DNSSEC, follow the steps to [Enable DNSSEC](/dns/dnssec/#enable-dnssec).
