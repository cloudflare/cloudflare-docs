import { GlossaryTooltip } from "~/components"

When you have a <GlossaryTooltip term="partial setup" link="/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/">partial zone</GlossaryTooltip>, Cloudflare handles DNS records a bit differently from full zones in order to internally resolve the origin server where proxied HTTP requests are sent to.

## Records within the same zone

When you [create a new DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) in a partial zone, Cloudflare automatically checks whether any of your `CNAME` records point to existing `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records within the same zone.

For example, Cloudflare would show a warning if you had the following records in your partial zone:

```txt
sub1.partialzone.com   CNAME   sub2.partialzone.com
sub2.partialzone.com   A       192.0.2.1
```

Since Cloudflare contains both the `CNAME` and its target, our DNS resolution will send incoming HTTP requests to `sub1.partialzone.com` to the origin `192.0.2.1`.

This can cause issues if you already have DNS records for `sub2.partialzone.com` at your authoritative DNS provider. These records may point to `192.0.2.4`, another IP address, or another domain but - because Cloudflare contains the initial record and the target - it never queries your authoritative DNS provider for the record for `sub2.partialzone.com`.

```mermaid

      accTitle: DNS resolution flow with CNAME target in same partial zone
      A[Request to <code>sub1.partialzone.com</code>] --> B[<code>CNAME</code> record for <code>sub1.partialzone.com</code> to <code>sub2.partialzone.com</code>]
      subgraph Cloudflare
        B --> C[<code>A</code> record for <code>sub2.partialzone.com</code> to <code>192.0.2.1</code>]
      end
      C --> D[<code>192.0.2.1</code>]
      subgraph Authoritative DNS
      E[<code>A</code> record for <code>sub2.partialzone.com</code> to <code>192.0.2.4</code>]
      end
```

<br />

When you avoid this situation - meaning you do not have the **target** of the `CNAME` record within your partial zone - this DNS resolution would happen differently.

      A[Request to <code>sub1.partialzone.com</code>] --> B[<code>CNAME</code> record for <code>sub1.partialzone.com</code> to <code>sub2.partialzone.com</code>]
      B --> C[<code>A</code> record for <code>sub2.partialzone.com</code> to <code>192.0.2.4</code>]
      C --> D[<code>192.0.2.4</code>]
      subgraph Cloudflare
        B
      end
      subgraph Authoritative DNS
        C
      end
```

## Records pointing to a partial zone within the same account

You could also [create a `CNAME` record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) in a zone (partial or full setup) that points to a record in another partial zone within your account.

In this case, Cloudflare will always resolve the `CNAME` target based on the value at your authoritative DNS provider of the partial target zone.

```mermaid

      accTitle: DNS resolution flow with CNAME target in a zone within the same account
      A[Request to <code>www.alice.com</code>] --> B[<code>CNAME</code> record for <code>www.alice.com</code> to <code>www.partialzone.com</code>]
      B --> C[<code>A</code> record for <code>www.partialzone.com</code> to <code>192.0.2.4</code>]
      C --> D[<code>192.0.2.4</code>]
      subgraph Cloudflare account
        subgraph Cloudflare zone 1
          B
        end
        subgraph Cloudflare zone 2
        E[<code>A</code> record for <code>www.partialzone.com</code> to <code>203.0.113.1</code>]
        end
      end
      subgraph Authoritative DNS
      C
      end
```
