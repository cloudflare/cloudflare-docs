## Before you begin

<Steps>
1. Create a Cloudflare account and add your domain.
2. Choose **Business** or **Enterprise** as your plan.
3. If you are onboarding a new domain to Cloudflare, ignore the instructions to change your nameservers.
4. (Recommended) Plan for SSL/TLS certificates:

    If you are only using [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) prior to converting your zone, a certificate will be provisioned for your subdomains only after each of the respective DNS records ([step 3](#3-add-dns-records) below) are [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/). Refer to [Enable Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/enable-universal-ssl/#partial-dns-setup) for details.

    If your domain is sensitive to downtime, instead of using Universal SSL, consider using an [advanced certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) with [delegated DCV](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/#setup).
</Steps>

## 1. Convert your zone and review DNS records

<Steps>
1. On the **Overview** page, select **Convert to CNAME DNS Setup**.
2. Select **Convert** to confirm.
3. Save the information from the **Verification TXT Record**. If you lose the information, you can also access it by going to **DNS** > **Records** > **Verification TXT Record**.
4. Make sure that you have all the DNS records for subdomains that you want to proxy through Cloudflare.
</Steps>

## 2. Verify ownership for your domain

Add the **Verification TXT Record** at your authoritative DNS provider. Cloudflare will verify the TXT record and send a confirmation email. This can take up to a few hours.

<Details header="Example verification record">
A verification record for `example.com` might be:

| Type | Name                            | Content             |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| TXT  | `cloudflare-verify.example.com` | 966215192-518620144 |
</Details>

:::note
If your authoritative DNS provider automatically appends DNS record `name` fields with your domain, make sure to only insert `cloudflare-verify` as the record name. Otherwise, it may result in an incorrect record name, such as `cloudflare-verify.example.com.example.com`.

After creating the record, you can use this [Dig Web Interface link](https://digwebinterface.com/?type=TXT\&ns=auth\&nameservers=) to search (`dig`) for `cloudflare-verify.<YOUR DOMAIN>` and validate if it is working.
:::

That record must remain in place for as long as your domain is active on the partial setup on Cloudflare.

If your organization has multiple Cloudflare accounts, also consider using zone holds to have more control over [domain ownership](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/#domain-ownership).

## 3. Add DNS records

<Steps>
1. At your authoritative DNS provider:
   1. Create `CNAME` records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net` for every hostname you wish to proxy through Cloudflare.

    <Details header="Example CNAME record at authoritative DNS provider">

    The `CNAME` record for `www.example.com` would be:

    ```txt
    www.example.com CNAME www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
    ```
    </Details>

    2. Remove any previously existing `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records referencing the hostnames you want to proxy through Cloudflare. For these hostnames, leave only the records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net`.

2. Repeat this process for each subdomain that should be proxied to Cloudflare.
