A partial setup is only available to customers on a Business or Enterprise plan.

## Add your domain to Cloudflare


1. Create a Cloudflare account and [add your domain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).

2. For your **Plan**, choose **Business** or **Enterprise**.

3. Continue through the onboarding steps, ignoring the instructions to change your nameservers.

4. On the **Overview** page, select **Convert to CNAME DNS Setup**.

5. Select **Convert** to confirm.

6. Save the information from the **Verification TXT Record**. If you lose the information, you can also access it by going to **DNS** > **Records** > **Verification TXT Record**.


## Verify ownership for your domain


Once you [add your domain to Cloudflare](#add-your-domain-to-cloudflare), add the **Verification TXT Record** at your authoritative DNS provider. Cloudflare will verify the TXT record and send a confirmation email. This can take up to a few hours.


<Details header="Example verification record">

A verification record for `example.com` might be:

| Type | Name                            | Content             |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| TXT  | `cloudflare-verify.example.com` | 966215192-518620144 |


</Details>

:::note


If your authoritative DNS provider automatically appends DNS record `name` fields with your domain, make sure to only insert `cloudflare-verify` as the record name. Otherwise, it may result in an incorrect record name, such as `cloudflare-verify.example.com.example.com`.

After creating the record, you can use this [Dig Web Interface link](https://digwebinterface.com/?type=TXT\&ns=auth\&nameservers=) to search (`dig`) for `cloudflare-verify.<YOUR DOMAIN>` and validate if it is working.


:::

That record must remain in place for as long as your domain is active on the partial setup on Cloudflare.


## Optional - Provision an SSL certificate


To provision a Universal SSL certificate through Cloudflare, follow [these instructions](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/enable-universal-ssl/#partial-dns-setup).

If your domain is already live with a partial (CNAME) setup — with Cloudflare or another DNS provider — you cannot use a TXT record for [Domain Control Validation](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/txt/). That domain's TXT record needs to be reserved for forwarding traffic to Cloudflare.


## Add DNS records


1. In Cloudflare, [add an `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).
2. At your authoritative DNS provider:

   1. Remove any existing `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records on the hostname you want to proxy to Cloudflare.

   2. Add a `CNAME` record for `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net`.

       <details>
       <summary>
       Example CNAME record at authoritative DNS provider
       </summary>

      The `CNAME` record for `www.example.com` would be:

      ```txt
      www.example.com CNAME www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
      ```

       </details>

   3. Repeat this process for each subdomain proxied to Cloudflare.
