    content: Troubleshooting secondary nameservers

---

When [updating your registrar](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/#4-update-registrar) with the Cloudflare secondary nameservers (`nsXXXX.secondary.cloudflare.com`), you get an error.

:::note


The exact error message depends on the system. Some examples would be: `Entity reference not found`,` Authorization error`, `Unable to create foreign nameserver`.


:::

Upon contacting your registrar, their services confirm that the Cloudflare nameservers cannot be added at this time.

***

## Root Cause

This issue may arise when one of our nameservers used for secondary setup are removed from the Verisign side.

***

## Solution

The Cloudflare engineering team needs to be engaged [through Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to make sure the nameserver gets registered again manually at Verisign.
