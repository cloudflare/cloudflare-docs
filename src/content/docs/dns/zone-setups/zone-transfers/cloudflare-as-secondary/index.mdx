With incoming zone transfers, you can keep your primary DNS provider and use Cloudflare as a secondary DNS provider.

When you make edits in your primary DNS provider, those DNS records will be transferred from your primary DNS provider to Cloudflare via zone transfer using [AXFR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5936) or [IXFR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1995).
