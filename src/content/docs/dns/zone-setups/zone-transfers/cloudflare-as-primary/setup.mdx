    content: Set up outgoing zone transfers (Cloudflare as Primary)
---

import { Render, TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components";

With [outgoing zone transfers](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-primary/), you can keep Cloudflare as your primary DNS provider and use one or more secondary providers for increased availability and fault tolerance.

## Aspects to consider

### DNS-only CNAME records

As explained in [DNS record types](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#cname), Cloudflare uses a process called [`CNAME` flattening](/dns/cname-flattening/) to return the final IP address instead of the `CNAME` target. `CNAME` flattening improves performance and is also what allows you to set a `CNAME` record on the zone apex.

Depending on the [settings](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/) you have, when you use DNS-only `CNAME` records with outgoing zone transfers, you can expect the following:

- For DNS-only `CNAME` records on the zone apex, Cloudflare will always transfer out the flattened IP addresses.
- For DNS-only `CNAME` records on subdomains, Cloudflare will only transfer out flattened IP addresses if the setting [**Flatten all CNAMEs**](/dns/cname-flattening/set-up-cname-flattening/#for-all-cname-records) is enabled.

### Proxied records

For each [proxied DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) in your zone, Cloudflare will transfer out two `A` and two `AAAA` records.

These records correspond to the [Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips) used for proxying traffic.

## Before you begin

Make sure your account team has enabled your zone for outgoing zone transfers.

Review your [existing DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) to make sure all of them have the desired **Proxy status**.

If using the API, you may also want to [locate your Zone and Account IDs](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

## 1. Create TSIG (optional)

<Render file="tsig-definition" />

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

<Render file="tsig-create-dash" />

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="tsig-create-api" />

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 2. Create Peer DNS Server (optional)

You only need to create a peer DNS server if you want:

- Your secondary nameservers to receive **NOTIFYs** for changes to your Cloudflare DNS records.
- A **TSIG** to sign zone transfer requests and **NOTIFYs**.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a peer using the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.
3. Select **DNS Zone Transfers**.
4. For **Peer DNS servers**, select **Create**.
5. Enter the following information, paying particular attention to:
   - **IP**: If configured, specifies where Cloudflare sends NOTIFY requests to.
   - **Port**: Specifies the IP Port for the NOTIFY IP.
   - **Enable incremental (IXFR) zone transfers**: Does not apply when you are using Cloudflare as your primary DNS provider (Cloudflare zones always accept IXFR requests).
   - **Link an existing TSIG**: If desired, link the TSIG you [previously created](#1-create-tsig-optional).
6. Select **Create**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To create a peer DNS server using the API, send a [POST](</api/operations/secondary-dns-(-peer)-create-peer>) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 3. Link peer to primary zone (optional)

If you previously [created a peer DNS server](#2-create-peer-dns-server-optional), you should link it to your primary zone.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To link a primary zone to a peer using the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **DNS** > **Settings**.
4. For **DNS Zone Transfers**, select **Manage linked peers**.
5. Select a peer.
6. Select **Save**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To link a primary zone to a peer using the API, send a [POST](</api/operations/secondary-dns-(-primary-zone)-create-primary-zone-configuration>) request with the ID of the peer you [previously created](#2-create-peer-dns-server-optional).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

:::caution[Multiple peers and TSIG]
If you link more than one peer to a zone and at least one of them has TSIG configured, all peers are expected to also use the same TSIG.
:::

## 4. Update your secondary DNS provider

Your secondary DNS provider should send zone transfer requests (via AXFR or IXFR) to [this IP](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/access-control-lists/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#transfer-ip) on port 53 and from the IP address specified in your [peer configuration](#2-create-peer-dns-server-optional).

It should also have updated [Access Control Lists (ACLs)](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/access-control-lists/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#allow-range) to prevent NOTIFY messages sent from Cloudflare IP ranges from being blocked.

## 5. Add secondary nameservers within Cloudflare

Using the information from your secondary DNS provider, [create `NS` records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) on your zone apex listing your secondary nameservers.

By default, Cloudflare ignores `NS` records added to the zone apex. To modify this behavior, enable [multi-provider DNS](/dns/nameservers/nameserver-options/#multi-provider-dns):

:::note
If your account [zone defaults](/dns/additional-options/dns-zone-defaults/) are already defined to have **Multi-provider DNS** enabled, this step may not be necessary.
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **DNS** > **Settings**.
4. Enable **Multi-provider DNS**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Send the following `PATCH` request replacing the placeholders with your zone ID and authentication information:

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/dns_settings" \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "multi_provider": true
}'
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 6. Enable outgoing zone transfers

When you enable outgoing zone transfers, this will send a DNS NOTIFY message to your secondary DNS provider.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **DNS** > **Settings**.
4. For **Outgoing Zone Transfers**, switch the toggle to **On**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

To enable outgoing zone transfers using the API, send a [POST](</api/operations/secondary-dns-(-primary-zone)-enable-outgoing-zone-transfers>) request.

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 7. Add secondary nameservers to registrar

At your registrar, add the nameservers of your secondary DNS provider.
