## Enable DNSSEC

When you enable DNSSEC, Cloudflare signs your zone, publishes your public signing keys, and generates your **DS** record.

### 1. Activate DNSSEC in Cloudflare

<Render file="dnssec-cloudflare-steps" product="dns" />

### 2. Add DS record to your registrar

<Render file="dnssec-registrar-steps" product="dns" />

<Render file="dnssec-auto-add" product="dns" />

***

## Other DNSSEC setup options

If you are using Cloudflare as your Secondary DNS provider and want to configure DNSSEC on your secondary zone(s), you have [three options](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/) depending on your setup.

If you want to set up DNSSEC on a subdomain zone, refer to [Subdomain DNSSEC](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/dnssec/).

***

## Limitations

If your registrar does not support DNSSEC with Cloudflare's preferred cipher choice (Algorithm 13), you have several options:

* Contact your registrar to ask for DNSSEC with modern encryption.
* Transfer your domain to a different registrar that supports DNSSEC with Algorithm 13
* File a [complaint with ICANN](https://www.icann.org/compliance/complaint), citing your registrar's lack of compliance.

If your top-level domain does not support DNSSEC with Algorithm 13 (also known as *ECDSA Curve P-256 with SHA-256*), [contact that top-level domain](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).
