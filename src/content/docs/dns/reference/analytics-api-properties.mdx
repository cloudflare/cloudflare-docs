This page describes API properties that you can use in requests to the [DNS analytics API](/api/operations/dns-analytics-table).

:::caution[Warning]
The [DNS analytics API](/api/operations/dns-analytics-table), along with the following [API properties](/dns/reference/analytics-api-properties/), will be deprecated soon.

To access the new analytics dashboard, go to **DNS** > **Analytics**. Refer to [Analytics and logs](/dns/additional-options/analytics/) for details.

## Metrics

A metric is a numerical value based on an attribute of the data, for example a query count.

In API requests, metrics are set in the `metrics` parameter. If you need to list multiple metrics, separate them with commas.



| Metric             | Name                          | Example | Unit                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| queryCount         | Query count                   | `1000`  | Count                |
| uncachedCount      | Uncached query count          | `1`     | Count                |
| staleCount         | Stale query count             | `1`     | Count                |
| responseTimeAvg    | Average response time         | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |
| responseTimeMedian | Median response time          | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |
| responseTime90th   | 90th percentile response time | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |
| responseTime99th   | 99th percentile response time | `1.0`   | Time in milliseconds |



## Dimensions

Dimensions can be used to break down the data by given attributes.

In API requests, dimensions are set in the `dimensions` parameter. If you need to list multiple dimensions, separate them with commas.



| Dimension          | Name                 | Example       | Notes                                                                                                                                     |

| responseSizeBucket | Response Size Bucket | `16-31`       | Response size bucket by multiples of 16.                                                                                                  |



## Filters

Filters use the form `dimension operator expression`, where each part corresponds to the following:

* **Dimension**: Specifies the [dimension](#dimensions) to filter on. For example, `queryName`.
* **Operator**: Defines the type of filter match to use. Operators are specific to dimensions.
* **Expression**: States the values to include or exclude from the results. Expressions use regular expression (regex) syntax.

### Filter operators

<Render file="api-filter-operators" product="fundamentals" params={{ one: "queryName", two: "example.com", three: "responseCode", four: "NOERROR" }} />

### Combining filters

<Render file="api-combine-filters" product="fundamentals" />


<Details header="Examples using OR">

* `responseCode==NOERROR,responseCode==NXDOMAIN` indicates that response code is either `NOERROR` or `NXDOMAIN`.
* `coloName==SJC OR coloName==LAX` indicates queries in either `SJC` or `LAX`.


</Details>


<Details header="Examples using AND">

* `responseCode==NOERROR;queryType==AAAA` indicates that response code is `NOERROR` and query type is `AAAA`.
* `queryType==AAAA AND coloName==SJC` indicates `AAAA` queries in `SJC`.
