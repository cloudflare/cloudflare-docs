You can use the third-party tools listed below to test and troubleshoot DNS settings.

* [DNSViz](https://dnsviz.net): A web-based tool for visualizing the status of a DNS zone to understand and troubleshoot the deployment of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

* [Dig Web Interface](https://digwebinterface.com): An online DNS lookup tool based on the command line interface `dig`. Users can skip the process of entering commands with complicated parameters in the terminal by entering the same information in this web tool and getting the same results.

* [dns.google](https://dns.google): A web-based tool, similar to Dig Web Interface, where users can get DNS responses for specific queries.

* [Mess with DNS](https://messwithdns.net): An educational resource that encourages users to experiment with DNS records by providing users with a domain where they are free to play around and break things during the learning process.
