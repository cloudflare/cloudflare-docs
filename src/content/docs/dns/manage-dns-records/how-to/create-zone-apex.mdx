When you add a domain to Cloudflare, you may also need to create a DNS record on your zone apex (`example.com`).

To do this, create an [IP address resolution record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) (`A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME`) using `@` for the **Name**, as in the following example.

<Example>

| Type | Name | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A    | `@`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

</Example>

<Render file="dns-record-steps" product="dns" params={{
    name: "your zone apex",
		example: "@"
}} />

## Domain redirects

Once you create a domain, you may want to route that traffic to other places.

For more guidance, refer to [Redirect domain to subdomain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/manage-subdomains/#redirect-the-apex-domain-to-a-subdomain) or [Redirect one domain to another](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/redirect-domain/).

## Get free SSL certificates

Cloudflare offers free, unshared, publicy trusted [Universal SSL certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) to all Cloudflare domains.
