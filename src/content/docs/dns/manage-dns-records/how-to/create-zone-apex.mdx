## Welcome to Your DNS Guide

When adding a domain to Cloudflare, you might need to create a DNS record on your zone apex (`example.com`). This guide will help you create a corresponding [`A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) using `@` for the **Name**.

<Example>

| Type | Name | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A    | `@`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

</Example>

### Domain Redirects

Once you create a domain, you may want to route that traffic to other places. Here are some helpful links:
- [Redirect domain to subdomain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/manage-subdomains/#redirect-the-apex-domain-to-a-subdomain)
- [Redirect one domain to another](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/redirect-domain/)

### Free SSL Certificates

Cloudflare offers free, unshared, publicly trusted [Universal SSL certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) to all Cloudflare domains.
