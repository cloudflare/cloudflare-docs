Most Internet service providers and some hosting providers dynamically update their customer's IP addresses. If this situation applies to you, you need an automated solution to dynamically update your DNS records in Cloudflare.

## Cloudflare API

Create a script to monitor IP address changes and then have that script push changes to the [Cloudflare API](/api/operations/dns-records-for-a-zone-update-dns-record).

## ddclient

[ddclient](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient) is a third-party Perl client used to update dynamic DNS entries for accounts on various DNS providers.

## DNS-O-Matic

[DNS-O-Matic](https://dnsomatic.com/docs/) is a third-party tool that announces dynamic IP changes to multiple services.

Configuration of DNS-O-Matic requires the following information:

* **Email**: `<CLOUDFLARE ACCOUNT EMAIL ADDRESS>` (associated account must have sufficient privileges to manage DNS)
* **API Token**: `<CLOUDFLARE GLOBAL API KEY>` (for details refer to [API Keys](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/))
* **Domain**: `<example.com>`
* **Hostname**: *dynamic*
