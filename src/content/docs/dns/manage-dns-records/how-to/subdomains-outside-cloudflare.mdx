title: Delegating Subdomains

---

import { FeatureTable } from "~/components"

Subdomain delegation allows different individuals, teams, or organizations to manage different subdomains of a site.

:::note

DNS delegation is not possible for Cloudflare domains using a [partial setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup). 
:::

For instance, consider `example.com` as a Cloudflare domain with `www.example.com` managed in Cloudflare’s **DNS** app and `internal.example.com` delegated to nameservers outside of Cloudflare. In this example, `internal.example.com` can now be managed by individuals who do not have access to Cloudflare credentials for the `example.com` domain.

:::caution

Cloudflare's CDN and security services are not applied to delegated subdomains.

## Delegate a subdomain

To delegate a subdomain such as *internal.example.com*, tell DNS resolvers where to find the zone file:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.

2. Select the domain that contains the subdomain to be delegated.

3. Go to **DNS** > **Records**.

4. Create `NS` records for the subdomain. For example:

   * `internal.example.com NS ns1.externalhost.com`
   * `internal.example.com NS ns2.externalhost.com`
   * `internal.example.com NS ns3.externalhost.com`

   :::note
   The `A` records for the subdomain are only required as glue records for nameservers that are located in the subdomain of the current zone that is being delegated. 
   :::

5. (Optional) If the delegated nameserver has DNSSEC enabled, [add the `DS` record](/dns/dnssec/#step-1---activate-dnssec-in-cloudflare) in Cloudflare.
