import { FeatureTable } from "~/components"

Use DNS record comments and tags to categorize and clarify the purpose of DNS records within Cloudflare.

Comments provide a unique descriptions for specific records, whereas tags group similar records into categories.

These attributes are particularly useful when:

* Multiple teams are managing DNS records within the same zone.
* Your zone contains a large number of DNS records.
* You want to filter your DNS records based on matching attributes (for example, when they are managed by the same team or used for the same application).

:::note


The information in record attributes will not impact DNS record resolution or propagation timing and is only meant for your private reference. This information is only visible to [members](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/manage/) of your Cloudflare account and is not visible publicly.

## Reference

### Comments

Comments are treated as [graphic Unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_character), meaning that they are case-sensitive and do not have any character limitations. However, comments do not support newline (`\n`) or carriage return (`\r`) characters.

### Tags

Tags are treated as an array of `name:value` pairs, meaning that tag names are not case-sensitive and can only contain letters, numbers, `-`, and `_`. For tag values, the same character restrictions apply as for comments.
