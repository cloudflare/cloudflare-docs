Cloudflare's authoritative DNS offering covers a variety of [setups](/dns/zone-setups/).

When you [add your domain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/) with Cloudflare as your [primary DNS provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) (the most common setup), we import your DNS records and become the authoritative DNS provider for that domain, meaning:

- You [manage DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) through the Cloudflare dashboard or API. This is how you control which resources are available on the apex domain (`example.com`) or specific subdomains (`blog.example.com`) of your website, as well as control other configurations.

- We [respond to all DNS queries](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#how-cloudflare-works-as-a-dns-provider) for your hostnames.

- The DNS records file (AKA the [DNS zone](/dns/concepts/#zone)) is cached across the[ Cloudflare global network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/), speeding up DNS resolution.

- A, AAAA, and CNAME records are set to [proxy through Cloudflare](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) by default.

The following links introduce important concepts and guide you through actions you may need to take while having your website or application on Cloudflare.

- [DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/): DNS records communicate information about your domain to visitors and other web services.

- [Nameservers](/dns/nameservers/): In the context of Cloudflare DNS, nameservers refer to authoritative nameservers. When a nameserver is authoritative for `example.com`, it means that DNS resolvers will consider responses from this nameserver when a user tries to access `example.com`.

- [Proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/): Proxy status determines how Cloudflare treats incoming HTTP/S requests to A, AAAA, and CNAME records. When a record is proxied, Cloudflare speeds up and protects HTTP/S traffic with our [cache](/cache/)/[CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/), [DDoS protection](/ddos-protection/), [WAF](/waf/), and [more](/products/?product-group=Application+performance%2CApplication+security).

- [How Cloudflare works](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/): An overview of how Cloudflare works as a DNS provider and as a reverse proxy.

- [DNS concepts](/dns/concepts/): Fundamental concepts to help you understand DNS terminology.

- [DNS analytics](/dns/additional-options/analytics/): An overview of the different data sources and insights you can get when using Cloudflare DNS.
