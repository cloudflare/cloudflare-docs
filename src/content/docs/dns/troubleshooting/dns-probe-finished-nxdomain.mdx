import { Render } from "~/components"

<Render file="dns-errors-ts-intro" params={{ one: "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN" }} />

## Background

`DNS_PROBE_FINISHED` means that the DNS request for a resource timed out and `NXDOMAIN` stands for non-existent domain. Together, these messages mean that the DNS query for a specific resource could not locate an associated domain.

Though visitors sometimes encounter this error — or similarly worded messages from Safari, Edge, or Firefox — because of network or local DNS issues, it might point to an issue with your DNS records in Cloudflare.

## Potential solutions

<Render file="dns-errors-ts-action" params={{ one: "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN" }} />
