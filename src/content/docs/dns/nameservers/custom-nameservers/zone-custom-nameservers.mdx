import { TabItem, Tabs } from "~/components";

With zone custom nameservers (ZCNS), each custom nameserver name must be a subdomain of the zone where the custom nameservers are configured.

For example, for a zone `domain.test`, the ZCNS can be `ns1.domain.test` and `ns2.domain.test` but they cannot use a different TLD (`ns1.domain.org`) nor a different domain (`ns1.example.com`).

## Use zone custom nameservers

### Primary (full setup) zones

To create zone custom nameservers:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and zone.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Records**.
3. On **Custom Nameservers**, click **Add Custom Nameservers** and enter the subdomains used for the ZCNS names (for example, `ns1`, `ns2`, `ns3`).

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Use the [Edit zone endpoint](/api/operations/zones-0-patch) and specify the custom nameservers in the payload:

```txt
"vanity_name_servers": ["ns1.example.com","ns2.example.com"]
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Cloudflare will assign an IPv4 and an IPv6 address to each ZCNS name and automatically create the associated `A` or `AAAA` records (visible after you refresh the page).

The next step depends on whether you are using [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/) for your domain:

- If you are using Cloudflare Registrar for your domain, [contact Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to add the custom nameservers and IP addresses as glue records to the domain.
- If you are not using Cloudflare Registrar for your domain, add the zone custom nameservers at your registrar as your authoritative nameservers and as [glue (A and AAAA) records](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1912.html#section-2.3). If you do not add these records, DNS lookups for your domain will fail.

### Secondary zones

If you are using [Cloudflare as a secondary DNS provider](/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/), you can still set up zone custom nameservers. After following the [steps above](/dns/nameservers/custom-nameservers/zone-custom-nameservers/#primary-full-setup-zones) to create zone custom nameservers, do the following:

1. Get the ZCNS IPs. You can see them on the dashboard (**DNS** > **Records**) or you can use the [Zone details endpoint](/api/operations/zones-0-get) to get the `vanity_name_servers_ips`.
2. At your primary DNS provider, add [`NS` records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ns) and, on the subdomains that you used as ZCNS names, add `A/AAAA` records.
3. At your registrar, add the zone custom nameservers as your authoritative nameservers and as [glue (A and AAAA) records](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1912.html#section-2.3).

## Remove zone custom nameservers

To remove zone custom nameservers (and their associated, read-only DNS records):

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and zone.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Records**.
3. On **Custom nameservers**, select **Remove custom nameservers**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Use the [Edit zone endpoint](/api/operations/zones-0-patch) and include an empty array in the payload:

```txt
"vanity_name_servers": []
```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Cloudflare will remove your ZCNS and their associated read-only `A` or `AAAA` records.

If you are not using Cloudflare Registrar for your domain, make sure to adjust your nameservers at the registrar, parent zone, or Primary DNS provider accordingly.
