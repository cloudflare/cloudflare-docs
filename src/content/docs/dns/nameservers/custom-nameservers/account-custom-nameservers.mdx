description: With account-level custom nameservers, you can use the same custom
  nameservers for different zones in the account. The domain or domains that
  provide the nameservers names do not have to exist as zones in Cloudflare.

---

import { Example, Render } from "~/components"

<Render file="acns-tcns-intro" params={{ one: "Account", two: "A", three: "account", four: "zones", five: "account " }} />

## Configuration conditions

For this configuration to be possible, a few conditions apply:

<Render file="acns-tcns-conditions" params={{ one: "account", two: "you", three: "You" }} />

<Render file="acns-tcns-byoip" params={{ one: "Account", two: "account" }} />

## Enable account custom nameservers

### 1. Set up ACNS names and sets

1. Use the [Add account custom nameserver endpoint](/api/operations/account-level-custom-nameservers-add-account-custom-nameserver) to create account custom nameservers. Follow the [conditions](#configuration-conditions) for `ns_name` and `ns_set`.

<Render file="ns-set-omission-callout" />

Cloudflare will assign an IPv4 and an IPv6 address to each ACNS name.

2. Make sure `A/AAAA` records with the assigned IPv4 and IPv6 exist at the authoritative DNS of the domain that provides the ACNS names.

   * If the domain uses Cloudflare DNS, the respective `A` and `AAAA` records are automatically created.

   * If the domain or domains that are used for the account custom nameservers do not exist within the same account, you must manually create the `A/AAAA` records on the configured nameserver names (for example, `ns1.example.com`) at the authoritative DNS provider.

  <Example>

  | Type | Name              | Content  |
  | ---- | ----------------- | -------- |
  | `A`  | `ns1.example.com` | `<IPv4>` |

  </Example>

3. Update the registrar of the domain that provides the ACNS names. This step depends on whether you are using [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/):

   * If you are using Cloudflare Registrar for the domain that provides the ACNS names, [contact Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to add the account custom nameservers and IP addresses as glue records to the domain.

   * If you are not using Cloudflare Registrar for the domain that provides the ACNS names, add the account custom nameservers and IP addresses to your domain's registrar as [glue records](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1912.html#section-2.3). If you do not add these records, DNS lookups for your domain will fail.

### 2. Use ACNS on existing zones

1. Choose an ACNS set as custom nameservers for a zone. Use the [Set ACNS Related Zone Metadata endpoint](/api/operations/account-level-custom-nameservers-usage-for-a-zone-set-account-custom-nameserver-related-zone-metadata) for each zone.

2. Make sure the nameservers are updated:

   * If your domain uses [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/), [contact Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to update your nameservers.
   * If your domain uses a different registrar or if it has been delegated to a parent domain, manually update your nameservers. Refer to [Update nameservers](/dns/nameservers/update-nameservers/) for detailed guidance.

### 3. (Optional) Make ACNS default for new zones

To make these ACNS the default nameservers for all new zones added to your account from now on, use the [Update Account endpoint](/api/operations/accounts-update-account) and set the value of `default_nameservers` to `custom.account`.

## Disable account custom nameservers

### 1. Remove ACNS assignment from zones

To remove ACNS from a zone, first update your nameservers to stop using ACNS:

* If you are using [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/), use the [Set ACNS Related Zone Metadata endpoint](/api/operations/account-level-custom-nameservers-usage-for-a-zone-set-account-custom-nameserver-related-zone-metadata) to change the `enabled` parameter to `false`, and then [contact Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to set your nameservers back to the regular Cloudflare-branded nameservers.
* If you are not using [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/), modify the domain's registrar to use your regular Cloudflare-branded nameservers and then use the [Set ACNS Related Zone Metadata endpoint](/api/operations/account-level-custom-nameservers-usage-for-a-zone-set-account-custom-nameserver-related-zone-metadata) to set the `enabled` parameter to `false`.

### 2. Delete ACNS names or sets

:::caution

Following the [configuration conditions](#configuration-conditions), each set must have between two and five different nameserver names. When you delete all names or leave a set with only one nameserver name, the set will no longer be listed as an option for the zones in your account.

:::

Use the [Delete account custom nameserver endpoint](/api/operations/account-level-custom-nameservers-delete-account-custom-nameserver) to delete a specific ACNS.
