Cloudflare classifies scripts and connections (also known as resources) according to the following:

- The number of times a script/connection was reported.
- Whether the script/connection is considered malicious or not.

Use Page Shield's dashboards to review the scripts loaded in your domain and the connections they make. For more information, refer to [Monitor resources and cookies](/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/).

## Available statuses

- **Infrequent**: There are less than three reports for the script/connection. If there are no reports for a script/connection with _Infrequent_ status for five days, then Page Shield will delete all the information about the script/connection. Scripts with _Infrequent_ status appear only in the All Reported Scripts dashboard, and connections with _Infrequent_ status appear only in the All Reported Connections dashboard.
- **Active**: There are more than three reports for the script/connection.
- **Inactive**: A previously active script/connection was not reported in the last seven days. If the script/connection is reported again later, its status will change back to _Active_. If the script/connection is not reported for 30 days, Page Shield will delete all the information about it. Scripts with _Inactive_ status appear only in the All Reported Scripts dashboard, and connections with _Inactive_ status appear only in the All Reported Connections dashboard.

:::note

All scripts and connections considered malicious will appear in the Monitors dashboard, regardless of their status.

Malicious script/connection detection is only available to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on.
