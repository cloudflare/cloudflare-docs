You can use Page Shield for PCI DSS v4's client-side security requirements (items 6.4.3 and 11.6.1).

Refer to the [PCI DSS v.4.0 Evaluation](https://cfl.re/4dhk8Gx) whitepaper for details on how you can use Cloudflare Page Shield to meet the new v4 requirements.

:::note
To help with PCI DSS requirements, Page Shield requires you to have an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on. Refer to [Availability](/page-shield/#availability) for details on what is included in each plan.
