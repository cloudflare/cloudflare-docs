Page Shield analyzes the JavaScript dependencies in the pages of your domain over time.

You can configure a notification for [code change alerts](/page-shield/reference/alerts/#code-change-alert) to receive a daily notification about changed scripts in your domain.

When you receive such a notification:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Page Shield** > **Monitors**.
3. Check the details of each changed script and validate if it is an expected change.
