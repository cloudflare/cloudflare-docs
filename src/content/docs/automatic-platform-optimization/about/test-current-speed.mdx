Before you begin using APO, we recommend testing your current site speed. Your site speed results give your website a letter grade and performance rating.

1. Visit [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/).
2. In the text field, enter your website's URL.
3. Click **Test your site**.

After the test runs, you can view your site's grade, performance rating, and other performance metrics.
