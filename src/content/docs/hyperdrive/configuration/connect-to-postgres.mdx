Hyperdrive supports PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL-compatible databases, [popular drivers](#supported-drivers) and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) libraries that use those drivers.

## Create a Hyperdrive

:::note

New to Hyperdrive? Refer to the [Get started guide](/hyperdrive/get-started/) to learn how to set up your first Hyperdrive.

:::

To create a Hyperdrive that connects to an existing PostgreSQL database, use the [wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) CLI or the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/hyperdrive).

When using wrangler, replace the placeholder value provided to `--connection-string` with the connection string for your database:

```sh
# wrangler v3.11 and above required
npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-first-hyperdrive --connection-string="postgres://user:password@database.host.example.com:5432/databasenamehere"
```

The command above will output the ID of your Hyperdrive, which you will need to set in the `wrangler.toml` configuration file for your Workers project:

```toml
# required for database drivers to function
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"

[[hyperdrive]]
binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
```

This will allow Hyperdrive to generate a dynamic connection string within your Worker that you can pass to your existing database driver. Refer to [Driver examples](#driver-examples) to learn how to set up a database driver with Hyperdrive.

Refer to the [Examples documentation](/hyperdrive/examples/) for step-by-step guides on how to set up Hyperdrive with several popular database providers.

## Supported drivers

Hyperdrive uses Workers [TCP socket support](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/#connect) to support TCP connections to databases. The following table lists the supported database drivers and the minimum version that works with Hyperdrive:

| Driver                        | Documentation                                                                | Minimum Version Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

^ _The marked libraries use `node-postgres` as a dependency._

Other drivers and ORMs not listed may also be supported: this list is not exhaustive.

## Supported TLS (SSL) modes

Hyperdrive supports the following [PostgreSQL TLS (SSL)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html) connection modes when connecting to your origin database:

| Mode          | Supported                       | Details                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`        | No                              | Hyperdrive does not support insecure plain text connections.                                                                              |
| `prefer`      | No (use `require`)              | Hyperdrive will always use TLS.                                                                                                           |
| `require`     | Yes (default)                   | TLS is required, and server certificates are validated (based on WebPKI).                                                                 |
| `verify-ca`   | Not currently supported in beta | Verifies the server's TLS certificate is signed by a root CA on the client. This ensures the server has a certificate the client trusts.  |
| `verify-full` | Not currently supported in beta | Identical to `verify-ca`, but also requires the database hostname must match a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) present on the certificate. |

:::caution

Hyperdrive does not currently support uploading client CA certificates. In the future, you will be able to provide the client CA to Hyperdrive as part of your database configuration.

## Driver examples

The following examples show you how to:

1. Create a database client with a database driver.
2. Pass the Hyperdrive connection string and connect to the database.
3. Query your database via Hyperdrive.

### Postgres.js

The following Workers code shows you how to use [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) with Hyperdrive.

<Render file="use-postgresjs-to-make-query" product="hyperdrive" />

### node-postgres / pg

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

```sh
npm install pg
```

**Ensure you have `compatibility_flags` and `compatibility_date` set in your `wrangler.toml` configuration file** as shown below:

<Render file="nodejs-compat-wrangler-toml" product="workers" />

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
import { Client } from "pg";

export interface Env {
	// If you set another name in wrangler.toml as the value for 'binding',
	// replace "HYPERDRIVE" with the variable name you defined.
	HYPERDRIVE: Hyperdrive;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		const client = new Client({
			connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
		});

		try {
			// Connect to your database
			await client.connect();

			// A very simple test query
			const result = await client.query({ text: "SELECT * FROM pg_tables" });

			// Clean up the client, ensuring we don't kill the worker before that is
			// completed.
			ctx.waitUntil(client.end());

			// Return result rows as JSON
			return Response.json({ result: result });
		} catch (e) {
			console.log(e);
			return Response.json({ error: e.message }, { status: 500 });
		}
	},
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Identify connections from Hyperdrive

To identify active connections to your Postgres database server from Hyperdrive:

- Hyperdrive's connections to your database will show up with `Cloudflare Hyperdrive` as the `application_name` in the `pg_stat_activity` table.
- Run `SELECT DISTINCT usename, application_name FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE application_name = 'Cloudflare Hyperdrive'` to show whether Hyperdrive is currently holding a connection (or connections) open to your database.

## Next steps

- Refer to the list of [supported database integrations](/workers/databases/connecting-to-databases/) to understand other ways to connect to existing databases.
- Learn more about how to use the [Socket API](/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets) in a Worker.
- Understand the [protocols supported by Workers](/workers/reference/protocols/).
