**Hyperdrive is free and included in every [Workers Paid](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) plan**.

Hyperdrive's [connection pooling and query caching](/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/) do not incur any additional charges, and there are no hidden limits other than those [published](/hyperdrive/platform/limits/).
