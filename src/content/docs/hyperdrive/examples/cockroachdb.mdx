This example shows you how to connect Hyperdrive to a [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) database cluster. CockroachDB is a PostgreSQL-compatible distributed SQL database with strong consistency guarantees.

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

To allow Hyperdrive to connect to your database, you will need to ensure that Hyperdrive has valid user credentials and network access.

### CockroachDB Console

The steps below assume you have an [existing CockroachDB Cloud account](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/cockroachcloud/quickstart) and database cluster created.

To create and/or fetch your database credentials:

1. Go to the [CockroachDB Cloud console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters) and select the cluster you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Select **SQL Users** from the sidebar on the left, and select **Add User**.
3. Enter a username (for example, \`hyperdrive-user), and select **Generate & Save Password**.
4. Note down the username and copy the password to a temporary location.

To retrieve your database connection details:

1. Go to the [CockroachDB Cloud console](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/clusters) and select the cluster you want Hyperdrive to connect to.
2. Select **Connect** in the top right.
3. Choose the user you created, for example,`hyperdrive-user`.
4. Select the database, for example `defaultdb`.
5. Select **General connection string** as the option.
6. In the text box below, select **Copy** to copy the connection string.

By default, the CockroachDB cloud enables connections from the public Internet (`0.0.0.0/0`). If you have changed these settings on an existing cluster, you will need to allow connections from the public Internet for Hyperdrive to connect.

## 2. Create a database configuration
