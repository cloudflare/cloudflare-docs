Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to deploy a ruleset. To deploy a ruleset, add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to a phase entry point ruleset, specifying the ruleset ID to execute as an action parameter. Use a separate rule for each ruleset you want to deploy.

A rule that executes a ruleset consists of:

- The **ID of the ruleset** you want to execute.
- An **expression**.
- An **action**, set to `execute`.

The rules in the ruleset execute when a request satisfies the expression.

:::note
To apply a rule to every request in a phase at the **zone** level, set the rule expression to `true`.

## Example

The following example deploys a managed ruleset to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`{zone_id}`) by adding a rule that executes the managed ruleset.

```bash
curl --request PUT \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "execute",
      "action_parameters": {
        "id": "<CLOUDFLARE_MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"
      },
      "expression": "true",
      "description": "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```json output
{
	"result": {
		"id": "<ZONE_PHASE_RULESET_ID>",
		"name": "Zone-level Ruleset 1",
		"description": "",
		"kind": "zone",
		"version": "latest",
		"rules": [
			{

				"action_parameters": {
					"id": "<CLOUDFLARE_MANAGED_RULESET_ID>",
					"version": "3"
				},
				"expression": "true",
				"description": "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset",
				"last_updated": "2021-03-18T18:08:14.003361Z",
				"ref": "<RULE_REF>",
				"enabled": true
			}
		],
		"last_updated": "2021-03-18T18:08:14.003361Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```
