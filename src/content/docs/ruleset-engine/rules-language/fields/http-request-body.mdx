:::note
Access to HTTP request body fields requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with a paid add-on, except for the `http.request.body.mime` field.
:::

The Rules language includes fields that represent properties of an HTTP request body. Many of these return [arrays](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#arrays) containing the respective values.

:::caution
All `http.request.body.*` fields (except `http.request.body.size`) handle a maximum body size of 128 KB, which means that you cannot define expressions that rely on request body data beyond the first 128 KB. If the request body is larger, the body fields will contain a truncated value and the `http.request.body.truncated` field will be set to `true`. The `http.request.body.size` field will contain the full size of the request without any truncation.

The maximum body size of 128 KB applies only to the values of HTTP body fields â€” the origin server will still receive the complete request body.
:::

The Cloudflare Rules language supports these HTTP body fields.

## `http.request.body.raw`

`http.request.body.raw` `String`

Represents the unaltered HTTP request body.

When the value of `http.request.body.truncated` is true, the return value may be truncated.

- Decoding: no decoding performed
- Whitespace: preserved
- Non-ASCII: preserved

## `http.request.body.truncated`

`http.request.body.truncated` `Boolean`

Indicates whether the HTTP request body is truncated.

When true, `http.request.body` fields may not contain all of the HTTP request body.

## `http.request.body.size`

`http.request.body.size` `Number`

The total size of the HTTP request body (in bytes).

:::note
This field may have a value larger than the one returned by `len(http.request.body.raw)`, since the `http.request.body.raw` field only considers the first 128 KB of the request.
:::

## `http.request.body.form`

`http.request.body.form` `Map<Array>String>>`

Represents the HTTP request body of a form as a Map (or associative array). Populated when the Content-Type header is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The values are not pre-processed and retain the original case used in the request.

When a field repeats, then the array contains multiple items in the order they are in the request.

The return value may be truncated if `http.request.body.truncated` is true.

- **Decoding:** no decoding performed
- **Whitespace:** preserved
- **Non-ASCII:** preserved

Example:

```txt
any(http.request.body.form["username"][*] == "admin")
```

Example value:
`{username": ["admin"]}`

## `http.request.body.form.names`

`http.request.body.form.names` `Array<String>`

Represents the names of the form fields in an HTTP request where the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The names are not pre-processed and retain the original case used in the request. They are listed in the same order as in the request.

Duplicate names are listed multiple times.

The return value may be truncated if `http.request.body.truncated` is true.

- **Decoding:** no decoding performed
- **Whitespace:** preserved
- **Non-ASCII:** preserved

Example:

```txt
any(http.request.body.form.names[*] == "username")
```

Example value:

`["username"]`

## `http.request.body.form.values`

`http.request.body.form.values` `Array<String>`

Represents the values of the form fields in an HTTP request where the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The values are not pre-processed and retain the original case used in the request. They are listed in the same order as in the request.

Duplicated values are listed multiple times.

The return value may be truncated if `http.request.body.truncated` is true.

- **Decoding:** no decoding performed
- **Whitespace:** preserved
- **Non-ASCII:** preserved

Example:

```txt
any(http.request.body.form.values[*] == "admin")
```

Example value:

`["admin"]`

## `http.request.body.mime`

`http.request.body.mime` `String`

The MIME type of the request detected from the request body.

Supports the most common MIME types of the following general categories: video, audio, image, application, text.

Example:

`image/jpeg`

This field is available on all Cloudflare plans.
