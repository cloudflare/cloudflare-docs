Most standard fields use the same naming conventions as [Wireshark display fields](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html). However, there are some subtle differences between Cloudflare and Wireshark:

- Wireshark supports [CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) for expressing IP address ranges in equality comparisons (`ip.src == 1.2.3.0/24`, for example). Cloudflare does not.

  To evaluate a range of addresses using CIDR notation, use the `in` [comparison operator](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#comparison-operators) as in this example: `ip.src in {1.2.3.0/24 4.5.6.0/24}`.

- In Wireshark, `ssl` is a protocol field containing hundreds of other fields of various types that are available for comparison in multiple ways. However, in the Rules language `ssl` is a single Boolean field that indicates whether the connection from the client to Cloudflare is encrypted.

- The Cloudflare Rules language does not support the `slice` operator.

:::note[Availability notes]

- Geolocation information is provided and maintained by MaxMind. Access to `ip.src.is_in_european_union`, `ip.src.subdivision_1_iso_code`, and `ip.src.subdivision_2_iso_code` fields requires a Cloudflare Business or Enterprise plan.

- Access to `http.request.cookies` field requires a Cloudflare Pro, Business, or Enterprise plan.

:::

The Cloudflare Rules language supports these standard fields.

## `http.cookie`

`http.cookie` `String`

Represents the entire cookie as a string.

Example value:

```txt
session=8521F670545D7865F79C3D7BEDC29CCE;-background=light
```

## `http.host`

`http.host` `String`

Represents the hostname used in the full request URI.

Example value:

```txt
www.example.org
```

## `http.referer`

`http.referer` `String`

Represents the HTTP Referer request header, which contains the address of the web page that linked to the currently requested page.

Example value:

```txt
Referer: htt­ps://developer.example.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
```

## `http.request.full_uri`

`http.request.full_uri` `String`

Represents the full URI as received by the web server (does not include `#fragment`, which is not sent to web servers).

Example value:

```txt
htt­ps://www.example.org/articles/index?section=539061&expand=comments
```

## `http.request.method`

`http.request.method` `String`

Represents the HTTP method, returned as a string of uppercase characters.

Example value:

```txt
GET
```

## `http.request.cookies`

`http.request.cookies` `Map<Array<String>>`

Represents the `Cookie` HTTP header associated with a request as a Map (associative array). The cookie values are not pre-processed and retain the original case used in the request.

**Decoding:** The cookie names are URL decoded. If two cookies have the same name after decoding, their value arrays are merged.

Example:

```txt
any(http.request.cookies["app"][*] == "test")
```

Example value:

```json
{ "app": ["test"] }
```

## `http.request.timestamp.sec`

`http.request.timestamp.sec` `Integer`

Represents the timestamp when Cloudflare received the request, expressed as Unix time in seconds. This value is 10 digits long.

To obtain the timestamp milliseconds, use the `http.request.timestamp.msec` field.

Example value:

```txt
1484063137
```

When validating HMAC tokens in an expression, pass this field as the `currentTimestamp` argument to the [is_timed_hmac_valid_v0()](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#hmac-validation) validation function.

## `http.request.timestamp.msec`

`http.request.timestamp.msec` `Integer`

Represents the millisecond when Cloudflare received the request, between 0 and 999.

To obtain the complete timestamp, use both `http.request.timestamp.sec` and `http.request.timestamp.msec` fields.

Example value:

```txt
857
```

Here is the formatted information for the provided rows:

## `http.request.uri`

`http.request.uri` `String`

Represents the URI path and query string of the request.

Example value:

```txt
/articles/index?section=539061&expand=comments
```

## `http.request.uri.path`

`http.request.uri.path` `String`

Represents the URI path of the request.

Example value:

```txt
/articles/index
```

## `http.request.uri.path.extension`

`http.request.uri.path.extension` `String`

The lowercased file extension in the URI path without the dot (`.`) character. This corresponds to the string after the last dot in the URI path, excluding the query string.

If the first character of the last path segment is a dot and the segment does not contain other dot characters, the field value will be an empty string (`""`). Having a dot as the first character does not represent a file extension and is commonly used in UNIX-like systems to denote a hidden file or directory.

Example values:

- If the URI path is `/articles/index.html`, the field value will be `html`.
- If the URI path is `/articles/index.`, the field value will be an empty string (`""`).

<Details header="Example values">

| URI path       | Field value |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| `/foo`         | `""`        |
| `/foo.mp3`     | `"mp3"`     |
| `/.mp3`        | `""`        |
| `/.foo.mp3`    | `"mp3"`     |
| `/foo.tar.bz2` | `"bz2"`     |
| `/foo.`        | `""`        |
| `/foo.MP3`     | `"mp3"`     |

</Details>

## `http.request.uri.query`

`http.request.uri.query` `String`

Represents the entire query string, without the `?` delimiter.

Example value:

```txt

```

## `http.user_agent`

`http.user_agent` `String`

Represents the HTTP User-Agent request header, which contains a characteristic string to identify the client operating system and web browser.

```

## `http.request.version`
