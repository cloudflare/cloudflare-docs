import { Render } from "~/components";

Dynamic fields represent computed or derived values, typically related to threat intelligence about an HTTP request.

:::note

- Access to `cf.bot_management.*` fields requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with [Bot Management](/bots/plans/bm-subscription/) enabled.

- Access to `cf.waf.content_scan.*` fields requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with [WAF content scanning](/waf/about/content-scanning/) enabled.

- The `cf.tls_client_auth.*` string fields are only filled in if the request includes a client certificate for [mTLS authentication](/ssl/client-certificates/enable-mtls/).

:::

The Cloudflare Rules language supports these dynamic fields.

## `cf.bot_management.verified_bot`

`cf.bot_management.verified_bot` `Boolean`

When `true`, this field indicates the request originated from a known good bot or crawler. Provides the same information as `cf.client.bot`.

## `cf.verified_bot_category`

`cf.verified_bot_category` `String`

Provides the type and purpose of a verified bot. For more details, refer to [Verified Bot Categories](/bots/reference/verified-bot-categories/).

## `cf.bot_management.score`

`cf.bot_management.score` `Number`

Represents the likelihood that a request originates from a bot using a score from 1–99. A low score indicates that the request comes from a bot or an automated agent. A high score indicates that a human issued the request.

## `cf.bot_management.static_resource`

`cf.bot_management.static_resource` `Boolean`

Indicates whether static resources should be included when you create a rule using `cf.bot_management.score`. For more details, refer to [Static resource protection](/bots/reference/static-resources/).

## `cf.bot_management.ja3_hash`

`cf.bot_management.ja3_hash` `String`

Provides an SSL/TLS fingerprint to help you identify potential bot requests. For more details, refer to [JA3/JA4 Fingerprint](/bots/concepts/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/).

## `cf.bot_management.ja4`

`cf.bot_management.ja4` `String`

Provides an SSL/TLS fingerprint to help you identify potential bot requests. For more details, refer to [JA3/JA4 Fingerprint](/bots/concepts/ja3-ja4-fingerprint/).

## `cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed`

`cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed` `Boolean`

Indicates whether the visitor has previously passed a JS Detection. For more details, refer to [JavaScript detections](/bots/reference/javascript-detections/).

## `cf.bot_management.detection_ids`

`cf.bot_management.detection_ids` `Array<Number>`

List of IDs that correlate to the Bot Management heuristic detections made on a request (you can have multiple heuristic detections on the same request). Use this field to explicitly match a specific heuristic or to exclude a heuristic in a rule.

Example:

```txt
any(cf.bot_management.detection_ids[*] eq 33554817)
```

## `cf.client.bot`

`cf.client.bot` `Boolean`

When `true`, this field indicates the request originated from a known good bot or crawler. Provides the same information as `cf.bot_management.verified_bot`.

## `cf.edge.server_ip`

`cf.edge.server_ip` `IP Address`

Represents the global network's IP address to which the HTTP request has resolved. This field is only meaningful for [BYOIP customers](/byoip/).

## `cf.edge.server_port`

`cf.edge.server_port` `Number`

Represents the port number at which the Cloudflare global network received the request. Use this field to filter traffic on a specific port. The value is a port number in the range 1–65535.

## `cf.hostname.metadata`

`cf.hostname.metadata` `String`

Returns the string representation of the per-hostname [custom metadata](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/) JSON object set by SSL for SaaS customers.

## `cf.random_seed`

`cf.random_seed` `Bytes`

Returns per-request random bytes that you can use in the [`uuidv4()`](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#uuidv4) function.

## `cf.ray_id`

`cf.ray_id` `String`

The Ray ID of the current request. A [Ray ID](/fundamentals/reference/cloudflare-ray-id/) is an identifier given to every request that goes through Cloudflare.

## `cf.threat_score`

`cf.threat_score` `Number`

Represents a Cloudflare threat score from 0–100, where 0 indicates low risk. Values above 10 may represent spammers or bots, and values above 40 identify bad actors on the Internet. It is rare to see values above 60. A common recommendation is to challenge requests with a score above 10 and to block those above 50.

## `cf.tls_cipher`
