import { Details } from "~/components";

Customize the execution of managed rulesets with a combination of ruleset overrides, tag overrides, and rule overrides in your phase entry point ruleset.

1. [Add a rule](/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset to execute a managed ruleset.
2. [Configure a ruleset override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that disables all rules in the managed ruleset.
3. [Configure a tag override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets an action for rules with a given tag.
4. [Configure a rule override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets an action for the rules you want to execute.

The request below uses the [Update ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to execute the following in a single `PUT` request:

- Add a rule to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
- Use category overrides to enable rules with `wordpress` and `drupal` tags and set their actions to `log`.
- Add a rule override that enables a single rule.

<Details header="Example: Execute a managed ruleset at the zone level with overrides">

In this example:

- `"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"` adds a rule to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to execute a managed ruleset for requests addressed to a zone (`{zone_id}`).
- `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the managed ruleset.
- `"categories": [{"category": "wordpress", "action": "log", "enabled": true}, {"category": "drupal", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the tag level to enable rules tagged with `wordpress` or `drupal` and sets their action to `log`.
- `"rules": [{"id": "<RULE_ID>", "action": "block", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the rule level that enables one individual rule and sets the action to `block`.

            {
              "id": "<RULE_ID>",
              "action": "block",
              "enabled": true
