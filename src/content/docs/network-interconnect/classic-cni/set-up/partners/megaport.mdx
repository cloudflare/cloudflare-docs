## Create a VXC with a service key

The Cloudflare account team creates the Service Key and sends it to you via email. After the Service Key is sent, anyone who has the key can use it to create a connection.

1. Log in to the [Megaport Portal](https://portal.megaport.com/).

2. Select **Megaport Marketplace** as the destination type.

3. Search the destination ports for the service provider.

4. Select a destination port. Typically, you should select the destination port closest to your port.

5. Select **Next**.

6. Specify these connection details:
   - **Name your connection** - The name of your VXC shown in the Megaport Portal.
   - **Invoice Reference (Optional)** - This can be any text, such as a PO number or billing reference number.
   - **Rate Limit** - The speed of your connection in Mbps up to the maximum limit defined by the key.
   - **Preferred A-End VLAN (Optional)** - Specifies an unused VLAN ID for the connection. This must be a unique VLAN ID on the Megaport and can range from `2` to `4093`. If you do not specify a value, Megaport assigns one.

     The B-End VLAN for the Cloudflare side termination automatically populates based on the service key.

7. Select **Next**. A summary page appears that includes the monthly cost.

8. Select **Back** to make changes or select **Add VXC** to move this configuration to your cart. Once you have finished this configuration, you can configure additional VXCs or proceed through the checkout process.

Cloudflare will accept the connection and your account team will contact you to establish the BGP session.
