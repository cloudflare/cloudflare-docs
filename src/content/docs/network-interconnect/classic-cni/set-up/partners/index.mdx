## Classic CNI (Partner)

Cloudflare partners with multiple network fabric providers to offer as many connectivity options and locations as possible. During the [configure the cross-connect](/network-interconnect/classic-cni/set-up/configure-cross-connect/) step, you will initiate a connection from your chosen provider's admin portal.

:::note
You can read more about the partner program on our website. Refer to
