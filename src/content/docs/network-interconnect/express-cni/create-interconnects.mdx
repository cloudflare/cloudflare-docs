1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/), and select your account.

2. Select **Interconnects** > **Create New**.

3. In **Direct CNI**, select **Create new**.

4. From the list, choose a location that suits you with **Select location**, or search for a location in the search box.

   :::note
   If your location is not listed it means that Express CNI is not available in your location yet. Refer to [Classic CNI](/network-interconnect/classic-cni/) to learn how you can use the classic version of network interconnect to connect your location to Cloudflare.

5. In **Choose your interconnect speed**, select either **1 Gigabit** or **10 Gigabit**. Then, give your interface a name and select **Continue**.

   :::note
   Contact your account team if you need 100 Gigabit connections.

6. Review the options you have chosen, and select **Confirm order**.

7. Download the Letter of Authorization that Cloudflare created with your settings. You will need this document to contact your data center and provide them the IP addresses for the CNI connection.

8. Select **View Interconnects** to review the CNIs you have ordered.
