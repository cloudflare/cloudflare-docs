Cloudflare Firewall Rules allows you to create rules that inspect incoming traffic and block, challenge, log, or allow specific requests.

<Render file="deprecation-notice" />

## Main features

* **Rule-based protection**: Use pre-defined rulesets provided by Cloudflare, or define your own firewall rules. Create rules in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.
* **Complex custom rules**: Each rule's expression can reference multiple fields from all the available HTTP request parameters and fields, allowing you to create complex rules.
