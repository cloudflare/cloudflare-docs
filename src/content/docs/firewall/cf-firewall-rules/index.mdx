import { Render } from "~/components";

Cloudflare Firewall Rules is a flexible and intuitive framework for filtering HTTP requests. It gives you fine-grained control over which requests reach your applications, proactively inspecting incoming site traffic and automatically responding to threats.

<Render file="deprecation-notice" />

In a firewall rule you define an [expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that tells Cloudflare what to look for in a request, and specify the appropriate [action](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/actions/) to take when those conditions are met. Expressions can reference [IP lists](/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#lists-with-ip-addresses-ip-lists) - groups of IP addresses that you can reference collectively by name.

To write firewall rule expressions, use the [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/), a powerful expression language inspired in the Wireshark Display Filter language.
