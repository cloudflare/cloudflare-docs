**Cloudflare Filters** is an API-only component of firewall rules for designing complex criteria that rely on boolean operators and other logic to examine incoming HTTP traffic and look for a match.

<Render file="deprecation-notice" />

For example, a filter matching:

* An HTTP user agent, and
* The HTTP path, and
* The source IP address

Associate a filter with a firewall rule to define the scope of that rule.

Use IP lists within a filter to refer collectively to a group of IP addresses. Refer to the [Lists API](/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/) for more information.

Before getting started with the Cloudflare Filters API, familiarize yourself with rule [expressions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/). For a complete reference, refer to [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/).

## Differences from other Cloudflare APIs

The Firewall Rules API behaves differently from most Cloudflare APIs in two ways:

* API calls accept and return multiple items, and allow applying data changes to multiple items.
* Although API calls return the [standard response](/fundamentals/api/), the error object follows the [JSON API standard](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors), such that in an error condition, it is clear which item produced the error and why.

To get started, review [What is a filter?](/firewall/api/cf-filters/what-is-a-filter/), followed by the Cloudflare Filters [JSON object](/firewall/api/cf-firewall-rules/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/firewall/api/cf-firewall-rules/endpoints/).
