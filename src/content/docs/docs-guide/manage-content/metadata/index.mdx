title: Metadata

import { DirectoryListing } from "~/components"

Page-level metadata - content type, associated products, last updated, word count - lets you take a broader, more strategic view of your content.

It helps you answer questions like the following:

* As a writer:
  * Am I missing something obvious in the content strategy?
  * What are some pages I should be updating right now?
* As a manager:
  * Are we over or underinvesting in a specific product area? Or a specific content type?
  * How does the traffic to this set of products compare to another?
  * How can I communicate broader trends to my stakeholders?

You cannot answer these questions without some level of rollup reporting, which you can only get through metadata.
