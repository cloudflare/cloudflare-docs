title: Redirects

---

import { DirectoryListing, GlossaryTooltip } from "~/components"

As your content changes (and it will change), <GlossaryTooltip term="redirect">redirects</GlossaryTooltip> preserve continuity for your users and (friendly) bots.

The most obvious part of this is the user experience. If you click a link in the dashboard or use a bookmarked URL, you trust that it's taking you to the right place. Not a `404` page or the wrong page, but the right page. Redirects help direct users to the right place.

The same applies to the automated experience. If you move a page without redirects, you are losing the historical search authority that Google and other search engines use to rank your page.
