    title: Fixed occasional attack score mismatches
    description: |-
      Fixed an issue causing score mismatches between the global [WAF attack score](/waf/detections/attack-score/) and subscores. In certain cases, subscores were higher (not an attack) than expected while the global attack score was lower than expected (attack), leading to false positives.

    title: Improved detection capabilities
    description: |-
      [WAF attack score](/waf/detections/attack-score/) now automatically detects and decodes Base64 and JavaScript (Unicode escape sequences) in HTTP requests. This update is available for all customers with access to WAF attack score (Business customers with access to a single field and Enterprise customers).
