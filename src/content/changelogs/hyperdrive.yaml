    title: The `node-postgres` (pg) driver is now supported for Pages applications using Hyperdrive.
    description: |-
      The popular `pg` ([node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) driver no longer requires the legacy `node_compat` mode, and can now be used in both Workers and Pages for connecting to Hyperdrive. This uses the new (improved) Node.js compatibility in Workers and Pages. 

      You can set [`compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat_v2"]`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) in your `wrangler.toml` or via the Pages dashboard to benefit from this change. Visit the [Hyperdrive documentation on supported drivers](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about the driver versions supported by Hyperdrive.

    title: Driver performance improvements
    description: |-
      Compatibility improvements to how Hyperdrive interoperates with the popular [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) driver have been released. These improvements allow queries made via Postgres.js to be correctly cached (when enabled) in Hyperdrive.

      Developers who had previously set `prepare: false` can remove this configuration when establishing a new Postgres.js client instance.

      Read the [documentation on supported drivers](/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-postgres/#supported-drivers) to learn more about database driver interoperability with Hyperdrive.
