    title: Pipelines is now in public beta.
    description: |-
      Pipelines, a new product to ingest and store real time streaming data, is now in public beta. The public beta is avaiable to any user with a [free or paid Workers plan](/workers/platform/pricing/). Create a Pipeline, and you'll be able to post data to it via HTTP or from a Cloudflare Worker. Pipelines handle batching, buffering, and partitioning the data, before writing it to an R2 bucket of your choice. It's useful to collect clickstream data, or ingest logs from a service. Start building with our [get started guide](/pipelines/getting-started/).
