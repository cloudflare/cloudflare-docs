      - Users can now complete conditional multipart publish operations. When a condition failure occurs when publishing an upload, the upload is no longer available and is treated as aborted.
  - publish_date: "2023-07-05"
    description: |-
      - Improved performance for ranged reads on very large files. Previously ranged reads near the end of very large files would be noticeably slower than
      ranged reads on smaller files. Performance should now be consistently good independent of filesize.
  - publish_date: "2023-06-21"

    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug where calling [GetBucket](/api/operations/r2-get-bucket) on a non-existent bucket would return a 500 instead of a 404.
      - Improved S3 compatibility for ListObjectsV1, now nextmarker is only set when truncated is true.
      - The R2 worker bindings now support parsing conditional headers with multiple etags. These etags can now be strong, weak or a wildcard. Previously the bindings only accepted headers containing a single strong etag.
      - S3 putObject now supports sha256 and sha1 checksums. These were already supported by the R2 worker bindings.
      - CopyObject in the S3 compatible api now supports Cloudflare specific headers which allow the copy operation to be conditional on the state of the destination object.

  - publish_date: "2022-10-28"
    description: |-
      - Multipart upload part sizes are always expected to be of the same size, but this enforcement is now done when you complete an upload instead of being done very time you upload a part.
      - Fixed a performance issue where concurrent multipart part uploads would get rejected.
  - publish_date: "2022-10-26"
    description: |-

      set for preflight requests.
  - publish_date: "2022-09-28"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug where CORS configuration was not being applied to S3 endpoint.
      - No-longer render the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header if `ExposeHeader` is not defined.
      - Public buckets will no-longer return the `Content-Range` response header unless the response is partial.
      - Fixed CORS rendering for the S3 `HeadObject` operation.

      - Temporarily disable copying objects that were created with multipart uploads.
      - Fixed a bug in the Workers bindings where an internal error was being returned for malformed ranged `.get` requests.
  - publish_date: "2022-09-27"
    description: |-
      - CORS preflight responses and adding CORS headers for other responses is now implemented for S3 and public buckets. Currently, the only way to configure CORS is via the S3 API.
      - Fixup for bindings list truncation to work more correctly when listing keys with custom metadata that have `"` or when some keys/values contain certain multi-byte UTF-8 values.
      - The S3 `GetObject` operation now only returns `Content-Range` in response to a ranged request.
  - publish_date: "2022-09-19"
    description: |-
      - The R2 `put()` binding options can now be given an `onlyIf` field, similar to `get()`, that performs a conditional upload.

      - The R2 `put()` binding now supports user-specified SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 checksums in options.
      - User-specified object checksums will now be available in the R2 `get()` and `head()` bindings response. MD5 is included by default for non-multipart uploaded objects.
  - publish_date: "2022-09-06"
    description: |-
      - The S3 `CopyObject` operation now includes `x-amz-version-id` and `x-amz-copy-source-version-id` in the response headers for consistency with other methods.
      - The `ETag` for multipart files uploaded until shortly after Open Beta uploaded now include the number of parts as a suffix.
  - publish_date: "2022-08-17"
    description: |-
      - The S3 `DeleteObjects` operation no longer trims the space from around the keys before deleting. This would result in files with leading / trailing spaces not being able to be deleted. Additionally, if there was an object with the trimmed key that existed it would be deleted instead. The S3 `DeleteObject` operation was not affected by this.
      - Fixed presigned URL support for the S3 `ListBuckets` and `ListObjects` operations.
  - publish_date: "2022-08-06"
    description: |-
      - Uploads will automatically infer the `Content-Type` based on file body
      if one is not explicitly set in the `PutObject` request. This functionality will
      come to multipart operations in the future.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-30"
    description: |-

  - publish_date: "2022-07-21"
    description: |-
      - Added dummy implementation of the following operation that mimics
        the response that a basic AWS S3 bucket will return when first created: `GetBucketAcl`.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-20"
    description: |-
      - Added dummy implementations of the following operations that mimic the response that a basic AWS S3 bucket will return when first created:

        - `GetBucketVersioning`
        - `GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration`
        - `GetBucketReplication`
        - `GetBucketTagging`
        - `GetObjectLockConfiguration`
  - publish_date: "2022-07-19"
    description: |-
      - Fixed an S3 compatibility issue for error responses with MinIO .NET SDK and any other tooling that expects no `xmlns` namespace attribute on the top-level `Error` tag.
      - List continuation tokens prior to 2022-07-01 are no longer accepted and must be obtained again through a new `list` operation.
      - The `list()` binding will now correctly return a smaller limit if too much data would otherwise be returned (previously would return an `Internal Error`).
  - publish_date: "2022-07-14"
    description: |-
      - Improvements to 500s: we now convert errors, so things that were previously concurrency problems for some operations should now be `TooMuchConcurrency` instead of `InternalError`. We've also reduced the rate of 500s through internal improvements.
      - `ListMultipartUpload` correctly encodes the returned `Key` if the `encoding-type` is specified.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-13"
    description: |-
      - S3 XML documents sent to R2 that have an XML declaration are not rejected with `400 Bad Request` / `MalformedXML`.
      - Minor S3 XML compatibility fix impacting Arq Backup on Windows only (not the Mac version). Response now contains XML declaration tag prefix and the xmlns attribute is present on all top-level tags in the response.
      - Beta `ListMultipartUploads` support.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-06"
    description: |-
      - Support the `r2_list_honor_include` compat flag coming up in an upcoming runtime release (default behavior as of 2022-07-14 compat date). Without that compat flag/date, list will continue to function implicitly as `include: ['httpMetadata', 'customMetadata']` regardless of what you specify.
      - `cf-create-bucket-if-missing` can be set on a `PutObject`/`CreateMultipartUpload` request to implicitly create the bucket if it does not exist.
      - Fix S3 compatibility with MinIO client spec non-compliant XML for publishing multipart uploads. Any leading and trailing quotes in `CompleteMultipartUpload` are now optional and ignored as it seems to be the actual non-standard behavior AWS implements.
  - publish_date: "2022-07-01"
    description: |-
      - Unsupported search parameters to `ListObjects`/`ListObjectsV2` are
      now rejected with `501 Not Implemented`.
      - Fixes for Listing:
        - Fix listing behavior when the number of files within a folder exceeds the limit (you'd end
      up seeing a CommonPrefix for that large folder N times where N = number of children
      within the CommonPrefix / limit).
        - Fix corner case where listing could cause
      objects with sharing the base name of a \"folder\" to be skipped.
        - Fix listing over some files that shared a certain common prefix.
      - `DeleteObjects` can now handle 1000 objects at a time.
      - S3 `CreateBucket` request can specify `x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled` with a value of `false` and not have the requested rejected with a `NotImplemented`
        error. A value of `true` will continue to be rejected as R2 does not yet support
        object locks.
  - publish_date: "2022-06-17"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a regression for some clients when using an empty delimiter.

        & `NoSuchUpload` errors were being returned as `NoSuchBucket`.
  - publish_date: "2022-06-13"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug with the S3 API `ListObjectsV2` operation not returning empty folder/s as common prefixes when using delimiters.
      - The S3 API `ListObjectsV2` `KeyCount` parameter now correctly returns the sum of keys and common prefixes rather than just the keys.
      - Invalid cursors for list operations no longer fail with an `InternalError` and now return the appropriate error message.
  - publish_date: "2022-06-10"
    description: |-
      - The `ContinuationToken` field is now correctly returned in the response if provided in a S3 API `ListObjectsV2` request.

  - publish_date: "2022-05-27"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug where the S3 API's `PutObject` or the `.put()` binding could fail but still show the bucket upload as successful.
      - If [conditional headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232) are provided to S3 API `UploadObject` or `CreateMultipartUpload` operations, and the object exists, a `412 Precondition Failed` status code will be returned if these checks are not met.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-20"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug when `Accept-Encoding` was being used in `SignedHeaders`
        when sending requests to the S3 API would result in a `SignatureDoesNotMatch`
        response.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-17"
    description: |-
      - Fixed a bug where requests to the S3 API were not handling non-encoded parameters used for the authorization signature.
      - Fixed a bug where requests to the S3 API where number-like keys were being parsed as numbers instead of strings.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-16"
    description: |-
      - Add support for S3 [virtual-hosted style paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html), such as `<BUCKET>.<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` instead of path-based routing (`<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<BUCKET>`).
      - Implemented `GetBucketLocation` for compatibility with external tools, this will always return a `LocationConstraint` of `auto`.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-06"
    description: |-
      - S3 API `GetObject` ranges are now inclusive (`bytes=0-0` will correctly return the first byte).
      - S3 API `GetObject` partial reads return the proper `206 Partial Content` response code.
      - Copying from a non-existent key (or from a non-existent bucket) to another bucket now returns the proper `NoSuchKey` / `NoSuchBucket` response.
      - The S3 API now returns the proper `Content-Type: application/xml` response header on relevant endpoints.
      - Multipart uploads now have a `-N` suffix on the etag representing the number of parts the file was published with.
      - `UploadPart` and `UploadPartCopy` now return proper error messages, such as `TooMuchConcurrency` or `NoSuchUpload`, instead of 'internal error'.
      - `UploadPart` can now be sent a 0-length part.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-05"
    description: |-
      - When using the S3 API, an empty string and `us-east-1` will now alias to the `auto` region for compatibility with external tools.
      - `GetBucketEncryption`, `PutBucketEncryption` and `DeleteBucketEncrypotion` are now supported (the only supported value currently is `AES256`).
      - Unsupported operations are explicitly rejected as unimplemented rather than implicitly converting them into `ListObjectsV2`/`PutBucket`/`DeleteBucket` respectively.
      - S3 API `CompleteMultipartUploads` requests are now properly escaped.
  - publish_date: "2022-05-03"
    description: |-
      - Pagination cursors are no longer returned when the keys in a bucket is the same as the `MaxKeys` argument.
      - The S3 API `ListBuckets` operation now accepts `cf-max-keys`, `cf-start-after` and `cf-continuation-token` headers behave the same as the respective URL parameters.
      - The S3 API `ListBuckets` and `ListObjects` endpoints now allow `per_page` to be 0.
      - The S3 API `CopyObject` source parameter now requires a leading slash.
      - The S3 API `CopyObject` operation now returns a `NoSuchBucket` error when copying to a non-existent bucket instead of an internal error.
      - Enforce the requirement for `auto` in SigV4 signing and the `CreateBucket` `LocationConstraint` parameter.
      - The S3 API `CreateBucket` operation now returns the proper `location` response header.

      - Fixed `.put()` for the Workers R2 bindings.
      - Fixed a regression where key names were not properly decoded when using the S3 API.
      - Fixed a bug where deleting an object and then another object which is a prefix of the first could result in errors.
      - The S3 API `DeleteObjects` operation no longer returns an error even though an object has been deleted in some cases.
      - Fixed a bug where `startAfter` and `continuationToken` were not working in list operations.

      - The S3 API `ListObjectsV2` now correctly honors the `encoding-type` parameter.
      - The S3 API `PutObject` operation now works with `POST` requests for `s3cmd` compatibility.
  - publish_date: "2022-04-04"
    description: |-
      - The S3 API `DeleteObjects` request now properly returns a `MalformedXML`
        error instead of `InternalError` when provided with more than 128 keys.
