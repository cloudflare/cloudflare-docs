  title: New KV Analytics API
  description: |-

    Workers KV now has a new [metrics dashboard](/kv/observability/metrics-analytics/#view-metrics-in-the-dashboard) and [analytics API](/kv/observability/metrics-analytics/#query-via-the-graphql-api) that leverages the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) used by many other Cloudflare products. The new analytics API provides per-account and per-namespace metrics for both operations and storage, including latency metrics for read and write operations to Workers KV.

    The legacy Workers KV [analytics REST API](/api/operations/workers-kv-request-analytics-query-request-analytics) will be turned off as of January 31st, 2025.
    Developers using this API will receive a series of email notifications prior to the shutdown of the legacy API.
