    title: Deprecation announcement for `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8`
    description: |-
      We will be deprecating `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8` on 2024-06-30.

      Replace the model ID in your code with a new model of your choice:
      - [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`](/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/) is the newest model in the Llama family (and is currently free for a limited time on Workers AI).
      - [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`](/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq/) is the new Llama 3 in a similar precision to your currently selected model. This model is also currently free for a limited time.

      If you do not switch to a different model by June 30th, we will automatically start returning inference from `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`.

    title: Add AI native binding
    description: |-
      * Added new AI native binding, you can now run models with `const resp = await env.AI.run(modelName, inputs)`
      * Deprecated `@cloudflare/ai` npm package. While existing solutions using the @cloudflare/ai package will continue to work, no new Workers AI features will be supported.
        Moving to native AI bindings is highly recommended
