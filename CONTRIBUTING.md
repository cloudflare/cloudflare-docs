# Contributing to Cloudflare's documentation

Before contributing code to Cloudflare's documentation, please read the following guidelines carefully.

## Have feedback for our documentation? Open an issue

[Open an issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/issues/new/choose) when something in our documentation is incorrect, out-of-date, or if the documentation doesn’t match the actual functionality.

## Before submitting a PR, open an issue

Before proposing significant changes, such as adding a new page, [open an issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/issues/new/choose) so that we can discuss your approach first. Only members of the Cloudflare organization can open a pull request on the repository, and they should follow the same guidance on opening an issue for significant changes. If you’re not part of the Cloudflare organization but want to contribute, fork the repository and then create a pull request.

A member of the Product Content Experience team will review the pull request. If the changes are straightforward, the pull request is approved and can be merged. If the pull request is more technical and requires an additional review, the new reviewer will leave any additional feedback.

If a pull request is not approved, the “won't fix” label is applied and a comment is added to explain why the pull request was closed.

If we require more information to address your pull request, the `more-information-needed` label will be applied to the pull request. If more information has not been provided within fourteen days, the pull request will automatically close.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits and commit messages
  - Use smaller commits for your work to make it easier to review. In your commit messages, be specific about what you changed in the files.
  - If you are proposing a new page, review our [content type guidelines](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/content-types/) for options and templates.
- Pull request titles
  - Follow the title structure of [Product Name] + work you did + affected file(s)
  - Example: [Access] fix broken link in example_file.md
- Pull request descriptions
  - Use bullet points to summarize the changes in the commits
  - Add any other information you think is helpful or needs addressed. If your PR fixes an open issue, indicate that your PR is addressing the issue and provide a link to the issue.

## Package manager

- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager#introduction-to-npm) is the recommended package manager that must be used in installing dependencies.
- The generated `package-lock.json` file must be committed to git.


## Workers Playground
If you are adding a code snippet to the docs that is:
1. A fully contained, valid Worker (i.e. it does not require external dependencies or specific bindings)
2. Only JavaScript

you can add `playground: true` to the code block metadata to render a button to let users open the Worker in the [Playground](https://workers.new). For example:

````
```js
---
playground: true
---
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    /**
     * Replace `remote` with the host you wish to send requests to
     */
    const remote = "https://example.com";

    return await fetch(remote, request);
  },
};
```
````
would render as
