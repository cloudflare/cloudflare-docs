# Constellation Runtimes

There are various machine learning and AI tools and frameworks being improved or emerging, with lots of innovation happening in the space. Constellation was designed to support multiple Machine Learning runtimes at its core.

Our vision is to support what works best for each category and use case, start the most popular runtimes, listen, learn, and adjust over time, as the tooling converges.

## Supported runtimes

Currently, Constellation supports the [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/).

The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an ecosystem supported by multiple technology companies and research organizations, defines open standards for machine learning, and makes open-source software for AI.

The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an ecosystem supported by multiple technology companies and research organizations, defines open standards for machine learning, and makes open-source software for AI.

The two essential parts of ONNX are the [open file format](https://onnx.ai/)), made with interoperability and [easy conversion](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials#converting-to-onnx-format) from other formats in mind, and the [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/), which we are running in Constellation.

| `ONNX` | ONNX Runtime | Cross-platform machine-learning model accelerator. ONNX Runtime can be used with converted models from PyTorch, Tensorflow/Keras, TFLite, scikit-learn, and other frameworks. |

We are exploring and researching other runtimes. [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/) is in the final stages of testing.

You can use Wrangler to list the supported models:

```bash
$ npx wrangler constellation runtime list
