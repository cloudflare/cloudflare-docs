To install Wrangler for Constellation, run:

```sh
$ npm install wrangler --save-dev
```

Test Wrangler with [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx):

```sh
$ npx wrangler constellation
wrangler constellation

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
# Top-level configuration
name = "my-worker"
main = "src/index.js"
compatibility_date = "2022-07-12"

workers_dev = false
route = { pattern = "example.org/*", zone_name = "example.org" }

constellation = [
    {binding = 'AI', project_id = '9d478427-dea6-4988-9b16-f6f8888d974c'},
    {binding = 'SENTIMENT_AI', project_id = '8128ac62-0010-5441-beaf-c001e1ee5939'}
