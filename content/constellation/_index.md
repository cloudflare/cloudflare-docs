Constellation allows you to run fast, low-latency inference tasks on pre-trained machine learning models natively on Cloudflare Workers. It supports some of the most popular machine learning (ML) and AI runtimes and multiple classes of models.

Cloudflare provides a curated list of verified models, or you can train and upload your own.

Functionality you can deploy to your application with Constellation includes:

* Image or audio classification
* Object detection
* Anomaly detection
* Text translation, summarization, or similarity analysis
* Natural language processing (NLP)
* Sentiment analysis
* Speech recognition (or text to speech)
* Question answering
