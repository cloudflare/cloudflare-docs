# Keyless SSL

The standard Cloudflare SSL service requires a customer to share the SSL key for their site. However, for some customers there are policy or technical obstacles preventing them from sharing the SSL key for their site. Keyless SSL allows you to use Cloudflareâ€™s SSL service while retaining on-premise custody of your private keys.

For more information, refer to the [Keyless SSL documentation](/ssl/keyless-ssl/).
