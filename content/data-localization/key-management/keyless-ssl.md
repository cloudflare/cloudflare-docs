# Keyless SSL

The standard Cloudflare SSL service requires a customer to share their site’s SSL key. However, for some customers there are policy or technical obstacles preventing them from sharing their site’s SSL key. Keyless SSL allows you to use Cloudflare’s SSL service while retaining on-premise custody of your private keys.

For more information, refer to [Keyless SSL docs](/ssl/keyless-ssl/).
