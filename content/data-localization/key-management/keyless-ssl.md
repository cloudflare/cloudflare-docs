# Keyless SSL

The standard Cloudflare SSL service requires a customer to share the SSL key for their site. However, for some customers there are policy or technical obstacles preventing them from sharing the SSL key for their site. Keyless SSL allows you to use Cloudflare's SSL service while retaining on-premise custody of your private keys.

For detailed information on implementation and configuration, refer to the [Keyless SSL documentation](/ssl/keyless-ssl/).
