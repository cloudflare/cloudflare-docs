# Customer Metadata Boundary


The Customer Metadata Boundary, as part of the Data Localization Suite, ensures that any customer end user traffic metadata that identifies that customer (that is, contains that customer's Account ID) stays in the EU or in the US, depending on the region the customer selects. That means, for example, that if a customer selects the EU Customer Metadata Boundary, metadata will only be sent to our core data center in the EU and not our core data center in the US.
