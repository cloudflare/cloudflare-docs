# Customer Metadata Boundary


As part of the Data Localization Suite, the Customer Metadata Boundary (CMB) ensures that any traffic metadata which identifies a customerâ€™s end user (that is, contains the customer's Account ID) will stay in the `EU` (Europe Union) or in the `US` (the United States), depending on the region the customer selects. For example, if a customer selects the `EU` Customer Metadata Boundary, metadata will **only** be sent to our core data center located in the European Union.

For information about product specific-behavior with Metadata Boundary, refer to the [Overview section](/data-localization/).
