# Get Started

You can configure the Metadata Boundary to select the region where your logs and analytics are stored via API or dashboard.

Currently, this can only be applied at the account-level. If you only want the Metadata Boundary to be applied on a portion of zones beneath the same account, you will have to [move the rest of zones to a new account](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/move-domain/).

## Configure Customer Metadata Boundary in the dashboard

To configure Customer Metadata Boundary in the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Go to **Manage Account** > **Configurations**.
3. In **Customer Metadata Boundary**, select the region you want to use. You have the option to select `EU` or `US`. If you want to select both regions, select `Global` instead.

## Configure Customer Metadata Boundary via API

You can also configure Customer Metadata Boundary via API. These are some examples of API requests.

Here is an example request using cURL to get current regions (if any):

```bash

}
' \
