# Get Started

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Interested customers need to contact their account team to enable DNS Regionalisation.

{{</Aside>}}

You can use Regional Services through the dashboard or via API.

## Configure Regional Services in the dashboard

To use Regional Services, you need to first create a DNS record in the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select an account and domain.
2. Go to the **DNS** tab.
3. Follow these steps to [create a DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).
4. From the **Region** dropdown, select the region you would like to use on your domain. This value will be applied to all DNS records on the same hostname. This means that if you have two DNS records of the same hostname and change the region for one of them, both records will have the same region.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Some regions may not appear on the dropdown because newly announced regions mentioned in the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/expanding-regional-services-configuration-flexibility-for-customers) are subject to approval by Cloudflare's internal team. For more information and entitlement reach out to your account team.
