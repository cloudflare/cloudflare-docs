# Get Started

You can use Regional Services through the dashboard or via API.

## Configure Regional Services in the dashboard

To use Regional Services, you need to first create a DNS record in the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select an account and domain.
2. Go to the **DNS** tab.
3. Follow these steps to [create a DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).
4. From the **Region** dropdown, select the region you would like to use on your domain. Refer to the table below for the complete list of available regions and their definitions. Note that only Super Administrators can view and edit the DNS Region used for Regional Services.
