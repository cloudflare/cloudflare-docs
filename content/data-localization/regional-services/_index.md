# Regional Services

Regional Services gives you the ability to accommodate regional restrictions by choosing which subset of data centers are able to service traffic on the HTTP level, while still using Cloudflareâ€™s global edge network. 

Regional Services proceeds and processes traffic within certain regions for customers who have to meet regional compliance or have preferences for maintaining regional control over their data. Examples of use cases could be a customer that needs to accommodate regional restrictions like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), or customers that are bound by agreement with their own customers that include geographic restrictions on data flows or data processing.

We store the SSL certificates, cache, and log within the region and only terminate the request in the regions. For example, if the zone has regional services of the EU, any request from the US will route to the EU to proceed. 

The table below details the products available for Regional Services, the products that work with some caveats, the products that cannot be used, and the products that are not  eligible for Regional Services. If you have purchased these products as part of your Enterprise subscription plan, Cloudflare will only terminate TLS connections for these products in the geographic region you have configured for Regional Services. You will be charged a Localization Suite Fee as described in the [Supplemental Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/supplemental-terms/#DataLocalizationSuite) for the Data Localization Suite.
