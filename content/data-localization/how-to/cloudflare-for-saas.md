# Cloudflare for SaaS

In the following sections, we will give you some details about how to configure Cloudflare for SaaS with Regional Services and Customer Metadata Boundary.

## Regional Services

To configure Regional Services for both hostnames [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) through Cloudflare and the fallback origin, follow these steps for the dashboard or API configuration:

{{<tabs labels="Dashboard | API">}}
{{<tab label="dashboard" no-code="true">}}

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select an account and zone.
2. Go to the **Custom Hostnames** tab.
3. Follow these steps to [configure Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/).

{{</tab>}}

{{<tab label="api" no-code="true">}}

1. Set the [fallback record](/api/operations/custom-hostname-fallback-origin-for-a-zone-update-fallback-origin-for-custom-hostnames).
2. Create a [Custom Hostname](/api/operations/custom-hostname-for-a-zone-create-custom-hostname).
3. Run the [API POST](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) command on the Custom Hostname to create a `regional_hostnames` with a specific region.

The Regional Services functionality can be extended to Custom Hostnames and this is dependent on the target of the alias.

Consider the following example.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

As a SaaS provider, I might want all of my customers to connect to the nearest data center to them and for all the processing and Cloudflare features to be applied there; however, I might have a few exceptions where I want the processing to only be done in the US.

In this case, I can just keep my fallback record with `Earth` as the processing region and have all my Custom Hostnames create a CNAME record and use the fallback record as the CNAME target. For any Custom Hostnames that need to be processed in the US, I will create a DNS record for example, `us.saasprovider.com` and set the processing region to `United States of America`. In order for the US processing region to be applied, my customers must create a CNAME record and use the `us.saasprovider.com` as the CNAME target. The origin associated with the Custom Hostname is not used to set the processing region, but instead to route the traffic to the right server.

{{</Aside>}}

Below you can find a breakdown of the different ways that you might configure Cloudflare for SaaS and the corresponding processing regions:

- No processing region: `fallback.saasprovider.com`
- Processing region is the `US`: `us.saasprovider.com`
- User location: `UK` (closest datacenter: `LHR`)

{{<table-wrap>}}

| Test | Custom Hostname | Target | Origin | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ​​`regionalservices-default.example.com` | `fallback.saasprovider.com` | default (fallback) | `LHR` |
| 2 | `regionalservices-default2.example.com` | `us.saasprovider.com` | default (fallback) | `EWR` |
| 3 | `regionalservices-custom.example.com` | `fallback.saasprovider.com` | `us.saasprovider.com` (custom) | `LHR` |
| 4 | `regionalservices-custom2.example.com` | `us.saasprovider.com` | `us.saasprovider.com` (custom) | `EWR` |

{{</table-wrap>}}

- In order to set a processing region for the fallback record to any of the available regions for Regional Services, create a new regional hostname entry for the fallback via a [POST](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) request. 

- To update the existing region (for example, from `EU` to `US`), make a [PATCH](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) request for the fallback to update the processing region accordingly. 

- To remove the regional services processing region and set it back to `Earth`, make a [DELETE](/data-localization/regional-services/get-started/#configure-regional-services-via-api) request to delete the region configuration.
