If you or your visitors experience `$1` errors after you [activate your domain on Cloudflare](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/), review your DNS records in Cloudflare.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If your domain is added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.
