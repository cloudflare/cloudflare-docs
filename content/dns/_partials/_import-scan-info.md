When you add a new domain to Cloudflare, Cloudflare automatically scans for common records and adds them to your account's **DNS** page. This scan is not guaranteed to find all existing DNS records, so make sure that all DNS records are added in the Cloudflare **DNS** page before [changing your nameservers](/zone-setups/full-setup/setup) to Cloudflare nameservers.
