# Partial (CNAME) setup

{{<render file="_partial-setup-definition.md">}}

## How to

*   [Set up a partial domain](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/)
*   [Convert a partial domain to a full domain](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/convert-partial-to-full/)

## Availability

A partial setup is only available to customers on a Business or Enterprise plan.

## Reference

### DNS resolution

With a partial zone, Cloudflare resolves [DNS records differently](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/dns-resolution/) than for full zones.

### CNAME flattening

A partial (`CNAME`) setup requires the proxied hostname to be pointed to Cloudflare via a `CNAME` record. Since [`CNAME` records are not allowed on the zone apex](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912#section-2.4) (`example.com`), you can only proxy your zone apex to Cloudflare if your authoritative DNS provider supports [`CNAME` Flattening](/dns/additional-options/cname-flattening/).

If your authoritative DNS provider does not support CNAME Flattening, redirect its traffic — for example, with an `.htaccess` file — to a subdomain proxied to Cloudflare.
