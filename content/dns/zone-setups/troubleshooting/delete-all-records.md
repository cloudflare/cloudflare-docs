# Delete all DNS records

When you connect your domain to Cloudflare, the [DNS records quick scan](/dns/zone-setups/reference/dns-quick-scan/) may automatically add several records to your zone.

If you realize most of them are not applicable and want to delete all DNS records, follow the steps below.

## Steps

This method assumes you are familiar with [API calls fundamentals](/fundamentals/api/).

1. Make sure you have [an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) that allows you to edit DNS for your zone.
2. Get your [zone ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
3. Run the following script, replacing `<ZONE_ID>` and `<API_TOKEN>` with the values you got from the previous steps.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
This script uses [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to format `JSON` outputs for readability. Refer to [Make API calls](/fundamentals/api/how-to/make-api-calls/) for details.

```bash
zoneid=<ZONE_ID>
bearer=<API_TOKEN>
curl --silent "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$zoneid/dns_records?per_page=50000" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $bearer" \
| jq --raw-output '.result[].id' | while read id
do
  curl --silent --request DELETE "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$zoneid/dns_records/$id" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $bearer"
done
```
