# Change your authoritative nameservers (Full setup)

{{<render file="_full-setup-definition.md">}}

## Step 1 — Do you already own a domain?

If you already own a domain and want to use Cloudflare for your authoritative DNS, proceed with this tutorial.

If you do not already own a domain name and plan to use Cloudflare for your authoritative DNS, we highly recommend purchasing your domain name through [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/get-started/register-domain/).

Using Cloudflare Registrar simplifies your setup process by automatically using Cloudflare for authoritative DNS.

## Step 2 — Complete prerequisites

### Create an account

Before you can complete your domain setup, you need to create an account and [add your domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare.

### Disable DNSSEC

### Review DNS records in Cloudflare

When you start using Cloudflare's nameservers for authoritative DNS, Cloudflare will become your primary DNS provider. This means that your DNS records in Cloudflare need to be accurate for your domain to work properly.

If you have [added your domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare, Cloudflare automatically scans for common records and adds them to your account’s DNS page.

## Step 3 — Update your nameservers

## Step 4 — Re-enable DNSSEC using Cloudflare

When you updated your nameservers, you should have also disabled DNSSEC at your registrar.

You should now [enable DNSSEC](/dns/additional-options/dnssec/) within Cloudflare to protect from domain spoofing.
