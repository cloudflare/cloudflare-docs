# Change your nameservers (Full setup)

{{<render file="_full-setup-definition.md">}}

---

## Before you begin

Before update your domain nameservers, make sure that you:

- Already own a domain name (such as `example.com` or `cloudflare.com`).
- Have previously created a [Cloudflare account](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/create-account/).
- Disabled DNSSEC at your registrar (where you bought your domain name).
  
{{<render file="_dnssec-providers.md">}}

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you do not already have a [domain name](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), get one at-cost through [Cloudflare Registrar](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/domains/register).

All domains purchased through Cloudflare Registrar automatically use Cloudflare for authoritative DNS, which means you can skip the rest of this tutorial.

## Add site to Cloudflare

In the Cloudflare dashboard, [add your domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/).

---

## Review DNS records

When you start using Cloudflare's nameservers for authoritative DNS and your zone is in a full setup, Cloudflare will become your primary DNS provider. This means that your DNS records in Cloudflare need to be accurate for your domain to work properly.

## Update your nameservers

{{<render file="_minimize-downtime-tip.md">}}

### Get nameserver names

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and domain.
2.  On **Overview**, locate the nameserver names in **2. Replace with Cloudflare's nameservers**.

    ![Find nameserver names on the Overview page of your domain](/dns/static/nameserver-names.png)

<br/>
3. Keep this window open while you perform the next step.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Cloudflare automatically assigns nameservers to a domain and these assignments cannot be changed. For more details, refer to [Nameserver assignments](/dns/zone-setups/reference/nameserver-assignment/).
{{</Aside>}}

### Update your registrar

1.  Log in to the admin account for your domain registrar. If you do not know your provider, use [ICANN WHOIS](https://whois.icann.org/).

2.  Remove your existing authoritative nameservers.

3.  Add the nameservers provided by Cloudflare. If their names are not **copied exactly**, your DNS will not resolve correctly.

To avoid common issues, refer to our [Nameserver replacement checklist](/dns/zone-setups/troubleshooting/nameservers/). 

{{</Aside>}}

### Verify changes

Wait up to 24 hours while your registrar updates your nameservers.

When your domain is **Active**:

- You will receive an email from Cloudflare.
- Your domain will have a [status](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) of **Active** on the **Websites** page of your account.
- Online tools such as https://www.whatsmydns.net/ will show your Cloudflare-assigned nameservers (most of these tools use cached query results, so it may take longer for them to show the updated nameservers).
- CLI commands will show your Cloudflare-assigned nameservers

```txt
*Linux/Unix*
dig <DOMAIN_NAME> +trace @1.1.1.1 
dig <DOMAIN_NAME> +trace @8.8.8.8

*Windows*
nslookup <DOMAIN_NAME> 1.1.1.1
nslookup <DOMAIN_NAME> 8.8.8.8
```

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you see unexpected results, refer to our [troubleshooting suggestions](/dns/zone-setups/troubleshooting/nameservers/) and check with your domain registrar.

{{</Aside>}}

## Re-enable DNSSEC

When you updated your nameservers, you should have also disabled DNSSEC at your registrar.

You should now [enable DNSSEC](/dns/additional-options/dnssec/) to protect from domain spoofing.
