# Nameserver assignment

When you activate a domain on a [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/), Cloudflare automatically assigns your nameservers. Each domain's assigned nameservers may be different than other domains, even if those domains are within the same account.

These nameserver assignments cannot be changed unless you set up [custom or vanity nameservers](/dns/additional-options/custom-nameservers/).

For more background on nameserver assignments, refer to [our blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/whats-the-story-behind-the-names-of-cloudflares-name-servers/).
