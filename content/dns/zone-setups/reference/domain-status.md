# Domain statuses

Once you [add a domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare on a full or partial setup, it moves through several statuses:

- **Setup**: You initiated but did not finish the signup process.

- **Pending Nameserver Update**: 

  - **Causes**:
  
    - [_Full setups_](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/): You have either not changed your authoritative nameservers at your registrar or your change has not yet been authenticated.
    - [_Partial setups_](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/): You have either not added the verification TXT record to your authoritative DNS or that record has not yet been authenticated.
  
  - **Limitations**:

    - Pending zones cannot be used to [proxy traffic to Cloudflare](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#pending-domains).
    - If your domain is on the Free plan, it will be deleted automatically if not activated within 28 days. Any pending zone with a paid plan (Pro, Business, Enterprise) will remain pending until the plan is removed or the domain is activated or [removed from Cloudflare](/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/manage-domains/remove-domain/).

- **Active**: Cloudflare has authenticated your [nameserver changes](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#update-your-nameservers) or [verification TXT record](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/#step-2--verify-ownership-for-your-domain) and you can proxy domain traffic through Cloudflare.

- **Moved**: Your domain has failed multiple DNS checks, indicating that your authoritative DNS no longer points to Cloudflare nameservers. The domain will be deleted automatically after 7 days, unless there is an active plan subscription.

- **Deleted**: This domain has been archived. You can re-add the domain to Cloudflare by following the [regular onboarding flow](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/).

If your domain's status changes, you will receive an email at the address associated with your account.

## Domain removal

If domains remain in the **Pending Nameserver Update** or **Moved** status for too long, Cloudflare automatically [removes them](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/221327488) from your account and the Cloudflare network.

You can also [manually remove a domain](/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/manage-domains/remove-domain/) from Cloudflare.

If you need to re-add a domain to your account, follow the [regular onboarding flow](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/).
