# Vendor-specific DNS records

This article requires prior knowledge of DNS record management via the Cloudflare dashboard. To learn more, refer to Cloudflare's article on [managing DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

## Google

### Google Workspace MX records

Google Workspace requires [specific MX records](https://support.google.com/a/answer/174125) added to your DNS provider.

Once you [add these records to Cloudflare](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/):

- [Test the configuration](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/check)
- Do not add other `MX` records other than those provided by Google.

### Google Workspace service URLs

If you want to customize the service addresses URLs associated with Google Workspace, refer to [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/53340).

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Google enforces HTTPS on its services. If you see errors about redirect
loops when browsing to your site through Cloudflare, use Cloudflare's [Full encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/).

### Google site verification

To add a site verification record in Cloudflare, follow [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7173990).

## Amazon

### Amazon Route53

AWS customers must [update their domain's nameservers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-name-servers-glue-records.html) to point to their new Cloudflare nameservers.

### Amazon S3 bucket

Find the [URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-bucket-intro.html) for your bucket.

Then, [create a `CNAME` record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) in Cloudflare. For example, if the full host URL of the bucket is `files.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com`, you would add a `CNAME` record similar to the following:

```txt
files  CNAME  files.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)

For help setting up DKIM in SES, refer to the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html).

### Amazon ELB configuration

Refer to [Amazon's ELB help content](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-domain-names-with-elb.html) for guidance on ELB configuration at Amazon, but generally you should:

Add a [`CNAME` record](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) to Cloudflare for the hostname, for example:

| Type | Name | Target | Proxy status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CNAME` | `elb` | `_<AWS HOSTNAME>.<REGION>._elb.amazonaws.com` | Proxied |
  
---

## Microsoft

### Microsoft 365

For information about the records to Microsoft 365, refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records).

### Microsoft Azure

Follow Microsoft’s instructions on [configuring Azure DNS settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain).

Then, add Azure’s required records to [Cloudflare DNS](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

Refer to Rackspace CloudFiles's documentation to [get a `CNAME` value](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/using-cnames-with-cloud-files-containers/), then [add that record within Cloudflare](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
The `CNAME` record needs to be [DNS-only (unproxied)](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#dns-only-records) since rackcdn.com is
not compatible with Cloudflare.
{{</Aside>}}

### Squarespace

First, make sure you [update your nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) and your domain is [active](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/).

Then, set up your Squarespace DNS records:

1. Get your Squarespace DNS information by following [these instructions](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/213469948).
2. In Cloudflare, [add those records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/):
    - All `A` records should be [Proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/)
    - The `CNAME` record for `www` should also be **Proxied**.
    - The `CNAME` record for `verify.squarespace.com` should be **DNS-only**.
3. If set up properly, your Squarespace DNS Settings page will now indicate that your 'Settings contain problems.' **This is the expected behavior**.
