# Set up DNS Firewall

## Prerequisites

Prior to setting up DNS Firewall, you need:

- Account access to DNS Firewall (provided by your Enterprise account team).
- Access to **DNS Administrator** or **Super Administrator** privileges on your account.
- Newly updated IP addresses for your nameservers (protects against previously compromised IP addresses).

## Configure DNS Firewall

### Create a DNS Firewall cluster

#### Using the dashboard

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) with DNS Firewall.
2.  On the account homepage, expand the **Manage Account** section and click **Configurations**.
3.  Click **DNS Firewall**.
4.  Click **Add Firewall Cluster**.
5.  Fill out the required fields, including:
    - **IP Addresses**: The upstream IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses of your authoritative nameservers.
    - **Minimum Cache TTL**: Recommended setting of **30 seconds**.
    - **Maximum Cache TTL**: Recommended setting of **1 hour**. Larger values increase the cache hit ratio, but also increase the time required for DNS changes to propagate.
    - **ANY queries**: Recommended setting is **Off** because these are often used as part of DDoS attacks. Also refer to this [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc8482-saying-goodbye-to-any/).
6.  Click **Continue**.
7.  On the following screen, save the values for **Your new DNS Firewall IP Addresses**.

If you forget to save your new IP addresses, find your cluster and click **IP Addresses**.

#### Using the API

You can also create a DNS Firewall cluster by sending a [POST request](/api/operations/dns-firewall-create-dns-firewall-cluster) to the API.

### Update registrar settings

Update the `A/AAAA` glue records for your nameserver hostnames at your registrar with your DNS Firewall cluster IP addresses.

### Update DNS servers

At your DNS servers, update the `A/AAAA` records for your nameserver hostnames in your DNS zone file with your DNS Firewall cluster IP addresses.

### Test DNS resolution

Confirm that your nameservers are functioning correctly by running a `dig` command.

### Update security policies

Configure security policy in your DNS servers and Firewall to allow only [Cloudflare IPs](https://cloudflare.com/ips) and TCP/UDP port 53.
