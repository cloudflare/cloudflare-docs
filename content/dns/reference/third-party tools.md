# Troubleshooting

Recommended third-party tools for DNS testing and troubleshooting.

- [DNSViz](https://dnsviz.net): a web-based tool for visualizing the status of a DNS zone to understand and troubleshoot the deployment of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

- [Dig Web Interface](https://digwebinterface.com): an online DNS lookup tool based on the command line interface `dig` where users can skip the process of entering commands with complicated parameters in the terminal by entering the same information in this web tool and getting the same results.

- [dns.google](https://dns.google): a web-based tool, similar to Dig Web Interface, where users can get DNS responses for specific queries.

- [Mess with DNS](https://messwithdns.net): an educational resource that encourages users to experiment with DNS records by providing users with a domain where they are free to play around and break things during the learning process.
