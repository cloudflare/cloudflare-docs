# Troubleshooting misconfigured DNS records

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **Email Routing** > **Settings**. Email Routing will show you the status of your DNS records, such as `Missing`.
3. Select **Enable Email Routing**.
4. The next page will show you what kind of action is needed. For example, if you are missing DNS records, select **Add records and enable**. 

If there is a problem with your SPF records, refer to [Troubleshooting SPF records](/email-routing/troubleshooting/email-routing-spf-records/).
