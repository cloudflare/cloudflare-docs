# Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a tool for generating static sites, written in Go. It is incredibly fast and has great high-level, flexible primitives for managing your content using different [content formats](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/).

In this guide, you will create a new Hugo application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will use the `hugo` CLI to create a new Hugo site.

{{<render file="_tutorials-before-you-start.md">}}

Go to [Deploy with Cloudflare Pages](#deploy-with-cloudflare-pages) if you already have a Hugo site hosted with your [Git provider](/pages/get-started/git-integration/).

## Install Hugo

Install the Hugo CLI, using the specific instructions for your operating system.

{{<tabs labels="MacOS | Windows | Linux">}}
{{<tab label="macos" default="true">}}

If you use the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run the `brew install` command in your terminal to install Hugo:

```sh
$ brew install hugo
```

{{</tab>}}
{{<tab label="windows">}}

If you use the package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), run the `choco install` command in your terminal to install Hugo:

```sh
$ choco install hugo --confirm
```

If you use the package manager [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), run the `scoop install` command in your terminal to install Hugo:

```sh
$ scoop install hugo
```

{{</tab>}}
{{<tab label="linux">}}

The package manager for your Linux distribution may include Hugo. If this is the case, install Hugo directly using the distribution's package manager — for instance, in Ubuntu, run the following command:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install hugo
```

If your package manager does not include Hugo or you would like to download a release directly, refer to the [**Manual**](/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/#manual-installation) section.

### Manual installation

The Hugo GitHub repository contains pre-built versions of the Hugo command-line tool for various operating systems, which can be found on [the Releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).

For more instruction on installing these releases, refer to [Hugo's documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

## Create a new project

With Hugo installed, refer to [Hugo's Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to create your project or create a new project by running the `hugo new` command in your terminal:

```sh
$ hugo new site my-hugo-site
```

Hugo sites use themes to customize the look and feel of the statically built HTML site. There are a number of themes available at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io) — for now, use the [Ananake theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/) by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
$ cd my-hugo-site
$ git init
$ git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
$ echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
```

## Create a post

Create a new post to give your Hugo site some initial content. Run the `hugo new` command in your terminal to generate a new post:

```sh
$ hugo new content posts/hello-world.md
```

Inside of `hello-world.md`, add some initial content to create your post. Remove the `draft` line in your post's frontmatter when you are ready to publish the post. Any posts with `draft: true` set will be skipped by Hugo's build process.

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Pages:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers & Pages** > **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
3. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

{{<pages-build-preset framework="hugo">}}

{{<Aside type="note" header="Base URL configuration">}}

Hugo allows you to configure the `baseURL` of your application. This allows you to utilize the `absURL` helper to construct full canonical URLs. In order to do this with Pages, you must provide the `-b` or `--baseURL` flags with the `CF_PAGES_URL` environment variable to your `hugo` build command.

Your final build command may look like this:

```sh
$ hugo -b $CF_PAGES_URL
```

{{</Aside>}}

After completing deployment configuration, select the **Save and Deploy**. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `hugo` and your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

{{</Aside>}}

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.
Every time you commit new code to your Hugo site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

## Use a specific or newer Hugo version

To use a [specific or newer version of Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), create the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in your Pages project > **Settings** > **Environment variables**. Set the value as the Hugo version you want to specify (v0.112.0 or later is recommended for newer versions).

For example, `HUGO_VERSION`: `0.115.4`.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you plan to use [preview deployments](/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/), make sure you also add environment variables to your **Preview** environment.
