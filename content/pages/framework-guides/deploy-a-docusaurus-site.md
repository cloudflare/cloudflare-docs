# Deploy a Docusaurus site

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is a static site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site such as a personal website, a product site, a blog, or marketing landing pages.

## Install Docusaurus

To begin, with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, create a new Docusaurus site by running:

```sh
$ npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

Deploy your site to Pages:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. In **Account Home**, select **Pages** > **Create a project**. 
3. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, select *Docusaurus* as your **Framework preset**. Your selection will provide the following information.

{{<table-wrap>}}

| Configuration option | Value                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Production branch    | `main`                      |
| Build command        | `npm run build`             |
| Build directory      | `build`                     |

{{</table-wrap>}}

4. Go to **Environment variables (advanced)** > **Add variable** > create a `NODE_VERSION` variable with a value of `16`.

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.

Every time you commit new code to your Docusaurus site and push those changes to GitHub, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/platform/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests and be able to preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).
