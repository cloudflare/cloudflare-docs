# Deploy a React site

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular framework for building reactive and powerful front-end applications, built by the open-source team at Facebook.

In this guide, you will create a new React application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will use `create-react-app`, a batteries-included tool for generating new React applications.

## Setting up a new project

Create a new project using `npx`, giving it the title `my-react-app` in your terminal.

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

And move into the application's directory via:

```sh
$ cd my-react-app
```

From here you can run your application with:

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Deploying with Cloudflare Pages

Deploy your site to Pages by logging in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) > **Account Home** > **Pages** and selecting **Create a project**. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and, in the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

<div>

| Configuration option | Value           |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Production branch    | `main`          |
| Build command        | `npm run build` |
| Build directory      | `build`         |

</div>

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `create-react-app`, your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.
Every time you commit new code to your React application, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](/pages/platform/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

By default, Cloudflare Pages assumes you are developing a single-page application. Refer to [Serving Pages](/pages/platform/serving-pages/#single-page-application-spa-rendering) for more information.
