# Functions

Pages Functions allows you to build full-stack applications by executing code on the Cloudflare network with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, handling form submissions, or working with middleware. Use Functions to deploy server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.

To feedback or ask questions on Functions, join the [Cloudflare Developers Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev) and connect with the Cloudflare team in the [#functions channel](https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/910978223968518144).
