### Deploy via the `create-cloudflare` CLI (C3)

If you use [`create-cloudflare`(C3)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) to create your new $1 project, C3 will install all dependencies needed for your project and prompt you to deploy your project via the CLI. If you deploy, your site will be live and you will be provided with a deployment URL.
