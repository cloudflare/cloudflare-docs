## Git integration

In addition to [Direct Upload](/pages/get-started/direct-upload/) deployments, you can make use of the [Pages Git integration](/pages/configuration/git-integration), which allows you to connect a GitHub or Gitlab repository to your Pages application and have the application automatically built and deployed after each new commit is pushed to it.

Setup requires a basic understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to GitHub's [summarized Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.
