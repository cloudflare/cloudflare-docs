# Custom domains

When deploying your Pages project, you may wish to point custom domains (or subdomains) to your site.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Purging the cache">}}

If Page Rules or other cache settings are used on your custom domain, that may lead to stale assets being served after a new build. You can resolve this by selecting **Caching** > **Configuration** > [**Purge Everything**](/cache/how-to/purge-cache/#purge-everything) in the dashboard to ensure the latest build gets served.

## Add a custom domain

To add a custom domain:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account in **Account Home** > **Pages**.
3. Select your Pages project > **Custom domains**.
4. Select **Set up a domain**.
5. Provide the domain that you would like to serve your Cloudflare Pages site on and select **Continue**.

### Add a custom apex domain

If you are deploying to an apex domain (for example, `example.com`), then you will need to add your site as a Cloudflare zone and [configure your nameservers](#configure-nameservers). 

#### Configure nameservers

To use a custom apex domain (for example, `example.com`) with your Pages project, [configure your nameservers to point to Cloudflare's nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/). If your nameservers are successfully pointed to Cloudflare, Cloudflare will proceed by creating a CNAME record for you.

### Add a custom subdomain

If you are deploying to a subdomain, it is not necessary for your site to be a Cloudflare zone. You will need to [add a custom CNAME record](#add-a-custom-cname-record) to point the domain to your Cloudflare Pages site. To deploy your Pages project to a custom apex domain, that custom domain must be a zone on the Cloudflare account you have created your Pages project on.

#### Add a custom CNAME record 

If you do not want to point your nameservers to Cloudflare, you must create a custom CNAME record to use a subdomain with Cloudflare Pages. After logging in to your DNS provider, add a CNAME record for your desired subdomain, for example, `shop.example.com`. This record should point to your custom Pages subdomain, for example, `<YOUR_SITE>.pages.dev`.

| Type    | Name               | Content                 |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `CNAME` | `shop.example.com` | `<YOUR_SITE>.pages.dev` |

If your site is already managed as a Cloudflare zone, the CNAME record will be added automatically after you confirm your DNS record.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

To ensure a custom domain is added successfully, you must go through the [Add a custom domain](#add-a-custom-domain) process described above. Manually adding a custom CNAME record pointing to your Cloudflare Pages site - without first associating the domain (or subdomains) in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard - will result in your domain failing to resolve at the CNAME record address, and display a [`522` error](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003011431-Troubleshooting-Cloudflare-5XX-errors#522error).

## Delete a custom domain

To detach a custom domain from your Pages project, you must modify your zone's DNS records.

First, log in to the Cloudflare dashboard > select your account in **Account Home** > select your website > **DNS**.

Then, in **DNS** > **Records**:

1.  Locate your Pages project's CNAME record.
2.  Select **Edit**.
3.  Select **Delete**.

Next, in the **Pages** dashboard:

1.  Select **your Pages project**.
2.  Go to **Custom domains**.
3.  Select the **three dot icon** next to your custom domain > **Remove domain**.

After completing these steps, your Pages project will only be accessible through the `*.pages.dev` subdomain you chose when creating your project.

## Known issues

### CAA records

Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) records allow you to restrict certificate issuance to specific Certificate Authorities (CAs).

This can cause issues when adding a [custom domain](/pages/platform/custom-domains/) to your Pages project if you have CAA records that do not allow Cloudflare to issue a certificate for your custom domain.

To resolve this, add the necessary CAA records to allow Cloudflare to issue a certificate for your custom domain.

```
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issue "comodoca.com"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issue "digicert.com; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issue "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issuewild "comodoca.com"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issuewild "digicert.com; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issuewild "letsencrypt.org"
example.com.            300     IN      CAA     0 issuewild "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
