* Added support for `.dev.vars` in `wrangler pages`.
  * This allows you to use environmental variables during your local development without chaining `--env`s.

## 2022-06-13

* Added deltas to `wrangler pages publish`.
  * We now keep track of the files that make up each deployment and intelligently only upload the files that we have not seen. This means that similar subsequent deployments should only need to upload a minority of files and this will hopefully make uploads even faster.
  * Requires Wrangler v2.0.11 or higher.
