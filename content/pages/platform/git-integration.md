# Git integration

Cloudflare supports connecting Cloudflare Pages to your GitHub and GitLab repositories to look for new changes to your project.

## Custom branches

Suppose you have a custom Git workflow that uses specific branches to represent your project's production build. In that case, you can specify a custom branch when creating (or managing an existing) project in the Pages dashboard by going to  **Settings** > **Builds & deployments** and clicking the **Configure Production deployments** button. You can change the production branch to any other branch in the dropdown menu under **production branch**.
 
You can also use [preview deployments](/pages/platform/preview-deployments/) to preview how the new version of your project looks before merging into `production`. In addition, Pages allows you to configure which of your preview branches are built and deployed by using [branch build controls](/pages/platform/branch-build-controls/).

To configure this in your Pages project go to **Settings** > **Builds & deployments** > **Configure preview deployment** and select **Custom branches**. Here you can specify branches you wish to include and exclude from automatic deployments in the provided configuration fields. To learn more refer to the [branch build controls](/pages/platform/branch-build-controls/) documentation.


## Organizational access

You can deploy projects to Cloudflare Pages from your open-source team, company, or side project on both GitHub and GitLab.

### GitHub

When authorizing Cloudflare Pages to access your GitHub account, you can also specify access to organizations that you belong to on GitHub.

### GitLab

By authorizing Cloudflare Pages to access your GitLab account, you will automatically allow all organizations on your GitLab account to be available for use.

## Removing access to your GitHub account

You can remove Cloudflare Pages' access to your GitHub account by viewing the [**Applications** page](https://github.com/settings/installations) on GitHub. Note that removing access to GitHub will also disable new builds, though the last build of your site will continue to be hosted via Cloudflare Pages.

## Removing access to your GitLab account

You can remove Cloudflare Pages' access to your GitLab account by navigating to **User Settings** > **Applications** > **Authorized Applications**. Find the applications called Cloudflare Pages and select the **Revoke** button to revoke access.

## Pausing Automatic Builds

By default, Cloudflare Pages automatically builds and deploys a project whenever its repository receives new commits. You can pause this behavior to keep your website at a particular version and manually deploy new versions when desired.

To pause automatic deployments, go to the Pages project's **Settings** > **Builds & deployments** > select **Pause deployments** at the end of the page.

Selecting **Pause deployments** will present a confirmation and, once confirmed, the **Pause deployments** button will be replaced with a **Resume deployments** button. While paused, your **Deployments** list will present a banner message, reminding you that automatic deployments are not enabled.
