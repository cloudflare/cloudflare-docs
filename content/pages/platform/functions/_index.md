# Functions

{{<Aside type="note" header="Functions is currently in beta">}}

You can track current issues that the Pages team is fixing in [Known issues](/pages/platform/known-issues/). Let us know any unreported issues by posting in the [Cloudflare Developers Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev).

{{</Aside>}}

With Pages, you can now build full-stack applications by executing code on the Cloudflare network with help from [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). Functions enable you to run server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server. With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, querying databases, handling form submissions, or working with middleware.
