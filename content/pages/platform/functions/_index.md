# Functions 

## Overview
With Pages, you can now build full-stack applications by executing code on the Cloudflare network with help from [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). Using Functions enables you to run server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server. With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, handling form submissions, or working with middleware.
