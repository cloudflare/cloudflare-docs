# Functions 

Pages Functions allows you to build full-stack applications by executing code on the Cloudflare network with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). With Functions, you can introduce application aspects such as authenticating, handling form submissions, or working with middleware. Use Functions to deploy server-side code to enable dynamic functionality without running a dedicated server.
