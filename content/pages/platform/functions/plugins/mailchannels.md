# MailChannels Pages Plugin

The MailChannels Pages Plugin intercepts all form submissions made which have the `data-static-form-name` attribute set. It then emails these form submissions using the MailChannels API.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @cloudflare/pages-plugin-mailchannels
```

## Usage

```typescript
---
filename: functions/_middleware.ts
---
import mailChannelsPlugin from "@cloudflare/pages-plugin-mailchannels";

export const onRequest: PagesFunction = mailChannelsPlugin({
  personalizations: [
    {
      to: [{ name: "ACME Support", email: "support@example.com" }],
    },
  ],
  from: {
    name: "ACME Support",
    email: "support@example.com",
  },
  respondWith: () => {
    return new Response(
      `Thank you for submitting your enquiry. A member of the team will be in touch shortly.`
    );
  },
});
```

```html
---
filename: public/contact.html
---
<body>
  <h1>Contact us</h1>
  <form data-static-form-name="contact">
    <label>Email address <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
    <label>Message <textarea name="message"></textarea></label>
    <button type="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
```

The Plugin takes a single argument, an object with a number of properties:

- `personalizations` is required and should be set to either an array, or a function which returns an array. If set to a function, it is passed a single object parameter which contains the incoming `request` (`Request`), `formData` (`FormData`) and `name` (`String`). This is useful if you want to populate dynamic values based on the form submission.

- `from` is also mandatory and should be set to either an object, or a function which returns an object. Again, if set to a function, it is passed a single object parameter which contains `request`, `formData` and `name`.

- `subject` is an optional `String` or function which returns a string. It defaults to `New <NAME> form submission`.

- `content` is an optional array or function which returns an array. It defaults to a `text/html` and `text/plain` body array, detailing the form submission contents.

- `respondWith` is a required function which takes the `request`, `formData` and `name` object parameter and returns a `Response` or `Promise` of a `Response`. Assuming the form submission is successful, this function will be called to generate response for visitors.

The `method` and `action` attributes of the HTML form do not need to be set. The Plugin will automatically override them to allow it to intercept the submission.
