# MailChannels Pages Plugin

The MailChannels Pages Plugin intercepts all form submissions made which have the `data-static-form-name` attribute set. It then emails these form submissions using the MailChannels API.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @cloudflare/pages-plugin-mailchannels
```

## Usage

```typescript
---
filename: functions/_middleware.ts
---
import mailChannelsPlugin from "@cloudflare/pages-plugin-mailchannels";

export const onRequest: PagesFunction = mailChannelsPlugin({
  personalizations: [
    {
      to: [{ name: "ACME Support", email: "support@example.com" }],
    },
  ],
  from: {
    name: "ACME Support",
    email: "support@example.com",
  },
  respondWith: () => {
    return new Response(
      `Thank you for submitting your enquiry. A member of the team will be in touch shortly.`
    );
  },
});
```

```html
---
filename: public/contact.html
---
<body>
  <h1>Contact us</h1>
  <form data-static-form-name="contact">
    <label>Email address <input type="email" name="email" /></label>
    <label>Message <textarea name="message"></textarea></label>
    <button type="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
```

The Plugin takes a single argument, an object with a number of properties:

- `personalizations` is required and should be set to either an array, or a function which returns an array. If set to a function, it is passed a single object parameter which contains the incoming `request` (`Request`), `formData` (`FormData`) and `name` (`String`). This is useful if you want to populate dynamic values based on the form submission.

- `from` is also mandatory and should be set to either an object, or a function which returns an object. Again, if set to a function, it is passed a single object parameter which contains `request`, `formData` and `name`.

- `subject` is an optional `String` or function which returns a string. It defaults to `New <NAME> form submission`.

- `content` is an optional array or function which returns an array. It defaults to a `text/html` and `text/plain` body array, detailing the form submission contents.

- `respondWith` is a required function which takes the `request`, `formData` and `name` object parameter and returns a `Response` or `Promise` of a `Response`. Assuming the form submission is successful, this function will be called to generate response for visitors.

The `method` and `action` attributes of the HTML form do not need to be set. The Plugin will automatically override them to allow it to intercept the submission.

For more information about MailChannels and the options they support, refer to [the documentation](https://mailchannels.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4565898358413-Sending-Email-from-Cloudflare-Workers-using-MailChannels-Send-API).

## SPF support for MailChannels

To use both MailChannels and Cloudflare Email Routing:

1. In **Account Home**, select the website you would like to add an SPF record for. 
2. Select **DNS** > **Records** > **Add Record**.
3. In the dropdown menu, select *TXT* as the type of record.  
4. Enter the SPF record below into your DNS server as a text (`TXT`) entry. This must be on the root (`@`) of the domain. (You currently cannot send mail from a subdomain.)

```
v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net include:relay.mailchannels.net -all
```

## DKIM support for Mailchannels API

The MailChannels API also allows you add a DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) credential to your DNS records. DKIM is an email authentication standard that helps you to sign email messages from your domain with a digital signature using public-key cryptography. Refer to [Cloudflare DNS DKIM guide](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/) to learn more.

{{<Aside type= "note" header="Optional content">}}
Setting up DKIM for use in your MailChannels Pages Plugin is optional, but will improve the deliverability of your emails. Clients will be less likely to mark your emails as spam or junk, because, when configured correctly, DKIM allows clients to verify that you own the domain you are sending from.
{{</Aside>}}

To add a DKIM signature to a message, add the following fields to the `personalization` object for the message:

**`dkim_domain`**: The domain you are sending the email from. For example, if you are sending an email from `support@example.com`, set this to `example.com`.

**`dkim_selector`**: Specifies where to find the associated public key in your DNS records. For example, if you make the DKIM record available at `mailchannels._domainkey.example.com`, set this to `mailchannels`.

**`dkim_private_key`**: The base-64 encoded private key.

## Generate DKIM credentials 

You can generate your DKIM credentials using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) in the following steps:

1. Generate your private key and DNS record by running the command below in your terminal: 

```sh
$ openssl genrsa 2048 | tee private_key.pem | openssl rsa -outform der | openssl base64 -A > private_key.txt
```
{{<Aside type="note" header="Command breakdown">}}

`openssl genrsa 2048` generates a 2048-bit RSA key. The output is passed to `tee private_key.pem`, which writes the key to the `private_key.pem` file, and passes the key to `openssl rsa -outform der | openssl base 64 -A`, which converts the key from PEM format to DER format, then base64 encodes it. Take this output into `> private_key.txt` which saves the contents to `private_key.txt`.

{{</Aside>}}

```sh
$ echo -n "v=DKIM1;p=" > dkim_record.txt && openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -outform der | openssl base64 -A >> dkim_record.txt
```

This creates a public key from the private key (`openssl rsa -in priv_key.pem -pubout -outform der`), encodes it in base64 (`openssl base 64 -A`), and finally writes it to the `dkim_record.txt` file.


2. Copy the contents of the `private_key.txt` file and add that as an environment variable to your Pages project by logging into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) > **Pages** > your Pages project > **Settings** > **Environment Variables* > **Add variables**. Set the variable name as `DKIM_PRIVATE_KEY` and the value as the contents of `private_key.txt` file.

3. Create a DNS record with the content of the generated `dkim_record.txt` file content.

Next, look in your generated `dkim_record.txt` file for your DKIM credentials, and add them to your website in the Cloudflare dashboard. Follow the steps below:

1. In Account Home, select the website you would like to add a DKIM record. 
2. In the menu on the left select **DNS** > **Records** > **Add Record**.
3. In the dropdown menu, select **TXT** as the type of record.  
4. Enter the DKIM record into your DNS server as a text (`TXT`) entry. The name of your DNS record must follow this convention `<selector key>._domainkey`. For example, `mailchannels._domainkey`.

{{<Aside type= "note" header="Selector value">}}
You can choose any value as the selector, as long as it is permitted as a DNS hostname (that is, all lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens).
{{</Aside>}}

5. Add the content of your `dkim_record.txt` file in the content field.

## Add DKIM fields to personalization object

After generating DKIM records, you must add the corresponding fields to the `personalizations` object to use DKIM. 

The required fields are `dkim_domain`, `dkim_selector`, `dkim_private_key`. The value of these fields must match the values you generated earlier.

The following code block shows an example of using DKIM with the MailChannels Pages Plugin.

```typescript
---
filename: functions/_middleware.ts
highlight: [7,8,9]
---
import mailChannelsPlugin from "@cloudflare/pages-plugin-mailchannels";

export const onRequest: PagesFunction = (context) => mailChannelsPlugin({
  personalizations: [
    {
      to: [{ name: "Some User", email: "user@cloudflare.com" }],
      "dkim_domain": "example.com", // The value has to be the domain you added DKIM records to and where you're sending your email from
      "dkim_selector": "mailchannels",
      "dkim_private_key": context.env.DKIM_PRIVATE_KEY
    },
  ],
  from: {
    name: "ACME Support",
    email: "support@example.com",
  },
  respondWith: () => {
    return new Response(
      `Thank you for submitting your enquiry. A member of the team will be in touch shortly.`
    );
  },
})(context);
```
