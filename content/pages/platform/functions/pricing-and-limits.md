# Pricing and limits

While still in open beta, there is no additional cost to deploy Functions within a Pages project. However, during beta, there is a total limit of 100,000 invocation requests per day. If you reach your daily limit, Pages will stop executing your Functions and fallback to serving only static assets.

If you reach this limit or need it increased in order to migrate your existing Workers applications into a Pages project, [complete this form](https://forms.gle/fK65trEL67cTvGQG6) to request an increase. You may track this limit by going to **Account Home** > **Pages** > and reviewing **Functions requests today**.

In the future, you can expect billing to reflect that of the Workers Bundled plan.
