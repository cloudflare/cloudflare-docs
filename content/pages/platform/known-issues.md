# Known issues

Here are some known bugs and issues with Cloudflare Pages:

- GitHub and GitLab are currently the only supported source code hosting tools.
- Pages currently only supports a single project per repository. Monorepos or repositories with multiple codebases/applications currently cannot deploy more than one project to Pages at a time.
- After you have selected a GitHub/GitLab repository for your Pages application, it cannot be changed. Remove/delete your Pages project and create a new one pointing at a different repository if you need to update it.
- `*.pages.dev` subdomains currently cannot be changed. If you need to change your `*.pages.dev` subdomain, delete your project and create a new one.
- Hugo builds automatically run an old version. To run the latest version of Hugo (for example, `0.80.0`), you will need to set an environment variable. Set `HUGO_VERSION` to `0.80.0` or the Hugo version of your choice.
- By default, Cloudflare uses Node `12.18.0` in the Pages build environment. If you need to use a newer Node version, refer to the [Build configuration page](/pages/platform/build-configuration/) for configuration options.
- For users migrating from Netlify, Cloudflare does not support Netlify's Forms and Serverless Functions features.
- It is currently not possible to add a custom domain with a wildcard, for example, `*.domain.com`.
- It is currently not possible to add a custom domain with a Worker already routed on that domain.
- It is currently not possible to add a custom domain with a Cloudflare Access policy already enabled on that domain.
- Cloudflare's Load Balancer does not work with `*.pages.dev` projects; an `Error 1000: DNS points to prohibited IP` will appear.
- A GitHub or GitLab account cannot be attached to more than one Cloudflare account.
- [Functions (beta)](/pages/platform/functions/) does not currently support adding/removing polyfills, so your bundler (for example, Webpack) may not run.
- When adding a custom domain, the domain may get stuck verifying due to being unable to validate a request for an SSL on that hostname. In order for the SSL to validate, ensure Cloudflare Access or a Cloudflare Worker is allowing requests to the validation path: `http://{domain_name}/.well-known/pki-validation/*`.

## Enabling Access on your `*.pages.dev` domain

If you would like to enable [Cloudflare Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams-access/)] for your preview deployments and your `*.pages.dev` domain, you must:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. From Account Home, select **Pages**.
3. Select your Pages project.
4. Go to **Settings** > **Enable access policy**.
5. Select **Edit** on the Acccess policy created for your preview deployments.
6. In Edit, go to **Overview**.
7. In the **Subdomain** field, delete the wildcard (`*`) and select **Save application**. You may need to change the **Application name** at this step to avoid an error.

At this step, your `*.pages.dev` domain has been secured behind Access. To resecure your preview deployments:

8. Go back to your Pages project > **Settings** > **General** > and reselect **Enable access policy**.
9. Review that two Access policies, one for your `<YOUR_SITE>.pages.dev` domain and one for your preview deployments (`*.<YOUR_SITE>.pages.dev`), have been created.

If you have a custom domain and protected your `*.pages.dev` domain behind access, you must:

10. Select **Add an application** > **Self hosted** in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard.
11. Input an **Application name** and select your custom domain from the *Domain* dropdown menu.
12. Select **Next** and configure your access rules to define who can reach the Access authentication page.
13. Select **Add application**.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

If you do not configure an Access policy for your custom domain, an Access authentication will render but not work for your custom domain visitors. If your Pages project has a custom domain, make sure to add an Access policy as described above in steps 10 through 13 to avoid any authentication issues.
