# Build configuration

You may tell Cloudflare Pages how your site needs to be built as well as where its output files will be located.

## Build commands and directories

You should provide a build command to tell Cloudflare Pages how to build your application. For projects not listed here, consider reading the tool's documentation or framework, and submit a pull request to add it here.

Build directories indicates where your project's build command outputs the built version of your Cloudflare Pages site. Often, this defaults to the industry-standard `public`, but you may find that you need to customize it.

<div>

The build command is provided by your framework. For example, the Gatsby framework uses `gatsby build` as its build command. When you are working without a framework, leave the **Build command** field blank.

The build directory is generated from the build command. Each framework has its own naming convention, for example, the build output directory is named `/public` for many frameworks.

The root directory is where your siteâ€™s content lives. If not specified, Cloudflare assumes that your linked git repository is the root directory. The root directory needs to be specified in cases like monorepos, where there may be multiple projects in one repository.

## Framework presets

Cloudflare maintains a list of build configurations for popular frameworks and tools. These are accessible during project creation. Below are some standard build commands and directories for popular frameworks and tools.

If you are not using a framework, leave the **Build command** field blank.

## Environment variables

If your project makes use of environment variables to build your site, you can provide custom environment variables by going to **Account Home** > **Pages** > **your Pages project** > **Settings** > **Environment variables**.

The following system environment variables are injected by default (but can be overridden):

| Environment Variable  | Injected value                        | Example use-case                                                                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CF_PAGES`            | `1`                                   | Changing build behaviour when run on Pages versus locally                               |
| `CF_PAGES_COMMIT_SHA` | `<sha1-hash-of-current-commit>`       | Passing current commit ID to error reporting, for example, Sentry                       |
| `CF_PAGES_BRANCH`     | `<branch-name-of-current-deployment>` | Customizing build based on branch, for example, disabling debug logging on `production` |
| `CF_PAGES_URL`        | `<url-of-current-deployment>`         | Allowing build tools to know the URL the page will be deployed at                       |

## Language support and tools

Cloudflare Pages' build environment has broad support for a variety of languages, such as Ruby, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Go.

If you need to use a specific version of a language, (for example, Node.js or Ruby) you can specify it by providing an associated environment variable in your build configuration, or setting the relevant file in your source code.

Here are the pinned versions for tools included in the Cloudflare Pages build environment, and how to override them as relevant:

| Zola        | (requires environment variable)           | Any version from 0.5.0 and up     | `ZOLA_VERSION`       |

If you want to set a specific version of a framework your Cloudflare Pages project is using, note that Pages will respect your package manager of choice during your build process. For example, if you use Gatsby.js, your `package.json` should indicate a version of the `gatsby` npm package, which will be installed using `npm install` as your project builds on Cloudflare Pages.

## Build environment

Cloudflare Pages builds are run in a [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/) container. The operating system is Ubuntu `20.04.5`. The architecture is `x86_64`.
