# C3 (create-cloudflare-cli)

C3 (create-cloudflare-cli) is a command-line tool designed to help you setup and deploy new projects to Cloudflare as fast as possible. In addition to speed, it leverages officially developed templates for Workers and framework-specific setup guides to ensure each new project that you setup follows Cloudflare and any third-party best practices for deployment on our network.

## Create a new project

To get started, open a terminal window and run:

```sh
$ npm create cloudflare
```

This will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) package, and lead you through a setup wizard. Once you've entered the setup wizard, you'll be asked which type of project you would like to create.

The list of project types includes Workers templates as well as the options for new Pages projects: "Static Site" and "Full Stack Application". If you select either of these options, you'll be asked to select a specific framework for your new project.

## Full stack application

### Select a framework

C3 will prompt you to choose one of the following full stack frameworks:

Once you select a framework, you will be prompted to install its create package which will lead you through a setup wizard.

## Static site

For deploying static sites, C3 currently supports Docusaurus and Gatsby. Just like full stack applications, once you select a framework, you will be prompted to install its create package which will lead you through a setup wizard.

## Deploy

Once your project has been configured and scaffolded, you will be asked if you would like to deploy the project to Cloudflare. This is optional. If you choose _not_ to deploy, the project will be created for you locally, and C3 will display some helpful links for further development. You will then need to navigate to the newly created project folder to begin development.

If you choose to deploy, you'll be asked to authenticate (if not logged in already), and your project will be deployed immediately. C3 will display your project's URL and some helpful links.
