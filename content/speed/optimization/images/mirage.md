# Cloudflare Mirage

Cloudflare Mirage accelerates image loading on your domain.

It does this by:

-   Automatically resizing images using JavaScript (by analyzing visitor connection and device type).
-   Virtualizing images, so visitors on poor connections get a smaller version at a lower resolution until they can access a higher bandwidth connection.
-   Streamlining image requests, so visitors can see optimized images immediately.
-   Acting as a lazy loader, turning all images into load on demand.

## Enable Mirage

{{<Aside type="note">}}
If you send a CSP (content security policy) header that restricts where scripts can be loaded, you will need to ensure `ajax.cloudflare.com` is enabled. For example, to allow scripts from your own domain and `ajax.cloudflare.com` enter the following:
`script-src 'self' ajax.cloudflare.com;`
{{</Aside>}}

To enable Mirage image optimization for your entire domain:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2.  Select your account and zone.
3.  Go to **Speed** > **Optimization** > **Image Optimization**.
4.  For **Mirage**, switch the toggle to **On**.

## Test Mirage

Mirage's features for Mobile Browser optimization are triggered based on high latency and poor network connections. You can test Mirage by making a request to your domain using a mobile [user-agent string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) and one of the following flags with your domain in your mobile browser:

`EXAMPLE.COM/?forcepreload`

To run the pre-loader only and serve degraded images on the page enter:

`EXAMPLE.COM/?forcepreloadonly`

Here is an example where Mirage 2 is triggered by a `?forcepreloadonly` flag. The notable image degradation is a sign that Mirage is working:
