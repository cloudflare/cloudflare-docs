# Image optimization on optimized images

Cloudflare's [image optimization features](/speed/optimization/images/) will likely not help much if you are already optimizing your images in some way (Smush.it, etc.).

Cloudflare recommends not activating other services on top of Cloudflare, because this setup can lead to unexpected outcomes and potential issues.
