{{<heading-pill style="deprecated">}} Mobile Redirect {{</heading-pill>}}

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Deprecation notice">}}
Mobile Redirect is deprecated and will be removed on 2024-06-30. You should configure [Single Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/) instead of using Mobile Redirect. Refer to [Perform mobile redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/examples/#perform-mobile-redirects) for examples of performing mobile redirects with Single Redirects.

Mobile Redirect allows you to automatically redirect mobile device visitors to a mobile-optimized website or subdomain home page. The redirect is done at the edge of Cloudflare's network, improving the user experience by eliminating a roundtrip to your server.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The mobile redirect service is not available to domains signed up
through hosting partners.

## Enable Mobile Redirect

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Speed** > **Optimization** > **Other**.
4. For **Mobile Redirect**, select the subdomain that you would like to redirect from the drop down list.
5. Choose **Keep Path** or **Drop Path**:

    - **Keep Path** will redirect all mobile requests to the same resource hosted on your mobile-optimized website. 
    - **Drop Path** will redirect all mobile requests to your mobile-optimized website homepage.

6. Toggle switch to **On**.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Mobile redirects only apply if the hostname you want to redirect is [proxied through Cloudflare](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/).

-   Palm

## Allow full site view

To allow your end users to view the full site on mobile, you will need to set the value of the following cookie _on the apex domain only_ to 0 (zero) at your origin server:

`__cf_mob_redir = 0; domain=.example.com`

In this example, replace .example.com with your apex domain.

To renew the mobile redirect, delete the cookie, or set it to expire after whatever duration you choose.
