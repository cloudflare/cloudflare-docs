# How does Cloudflare compress content?

Cloudflare compresses content in two ways: between Cloudflare and your website visitors and between Cloudflare and your origin server.

## Compression between Cloudflare and website visitors

In addition to Cloudflare's [default caching behavior](/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/) and [auto minification](/speed/optimization/content/auto-minify/) of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML content, Cloudflare supports Gzip and Brotli compression when delivering content to website visitors.

C -.-> B == "Response<br>(Gzip / Brotli / No compression)" ==> A

If supported by visitors' web browsers, Cloudflare will return Gzip or Brotli-encoded responses for the following content types:

```
text/html
text/richtext
text/plain
text/css
text/x-script
text/x-component
text/x-java-source

```

Cloudflare's global network can deliver content to website visitors using Gzip compression, Brotli compression, or no compression, according to the values visitors provide in the `Accept-Encoding` request header.

For responses with error status codes, Cloudflare will only compress responses if their error status code is `403` or `404`. For successful response status codes, Cloudflare will only compress responses if their status code is `200`. Responses with other status codes will not be compressed.

Enterprise customers can override Cloudflare's default compression behavior using [Compression Rules](/rules/compression-rules/).

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Minimum response size for compression">}}

Cloudflare will only apply compression to responses with a minimum size when sending them to website visitors:
* For Gzip, responses must have a minimum size of 48 bytes.
* For Brotli, responses must have a minimum size of 50 bytes.

Smaller responses will not be compressed, regardless of their content type.

## Content compression from origin servers to the Cloudflare network

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Brotli support is scheduled to be gradually rolled out beginning February 1st, 2024. Until then, only Gzip compression is supported between Cloudflare and your origin.
{{</Aside>}}

When requesting content from your origin server, Cloudflare supports Gzip compression, Brotli compression, or no compression.

```mermaid

accTitle: Compressed responses sent from the origin server
accDescr: Cloudflare accepts responses from origin server using Gzip compression, Brotli compression, or no compression.

A[Visitor browser]
B((Cloudflare))
C[(Origin server)]

A -.-> B == "Request<br>Accept-Encoding: gzip, br" ==> C
C == "Response<br>Accept-Encoding: (Gzip / Brotli / No compression)" ==> B -.-> A

style A stroke-dasharray: 5 5
style B stroke: orange,fill: orange
style C stroke-width: 3px
```

If your origin server responds to a Cloudflare request using Gzip/Brotli compression, we will keep the same compression in the response sent to the website visitor if:

* You include a `Content-Encoding` header in your server response mentioning the compression being used (`gzip` or `br`).
* The visitor browser (or client) supports the compression algorithm.
* You do not enable Cloudflare features that change the response content (refer to [Notes about end-to-end compression](#notes-about-end-to-end-compression) for details).

Cloudflare's reverse proxy can also convert between compressed formats and uncompressed formats. Cloudflare can receive content from your origin server with Gzip or Brotli compression and serve it to visitors uncompressed (or vice versa), independently of caching.

If you do not want a particular response from your origin to be encoded with Gzip/Brotli when delivered to website visitors, you can disable this by including a `cache-control: no-transform` HTTP header in the response from your origin web server.

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Warning">}}
Cloudflare will take into consideration the `Accept-Encoding` header value in website visitors' requests when sending responses to those visitors. However, when requesting content from your origin server, Cloudflare will send a different `Accept-Encoding` header, supporting Gzip and Brotli compression.
