{{<Aside type="warning" header="Deprecation notice">}}
Auto Minify is deprecated and will be removed on 2024-08-05. After this date, Auto Minify will no longer be available via the Cloudflare dashboard, API, or Terraform.

Once the feature is removed, Cloudflare will no longer minify content. We recommend that you minify at the origin during the build phase. Minification is included in most modern web development frameworks.
