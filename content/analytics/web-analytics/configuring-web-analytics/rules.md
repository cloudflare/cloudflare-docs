# Rules

Use **Rules** to configure whether to track Web Analytics for specific websites or paths. If you do not configure any rules, Web Analytics injects the JavaScript (JS) snippet for all sites.

Rules are only available for sites proxied through Cloudflare. For more information, refer to [Limits](/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/limits/).

1.  From **Quick Actions**, click **View Web Analytics sites**.
2.  Find the site you want to configure and click **Manage site**.
3.  Click **Advanced options** > **Add rule**.
4.  Select the **Action** and fill in the Host name and Path(s) you want to add a rule for.
5.  If you want to add additional rules, click **Add rule**. Otherwise click **Update** to save the rule.
