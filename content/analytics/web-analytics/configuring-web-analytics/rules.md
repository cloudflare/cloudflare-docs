# Rules

Use **Rules** to configure whether to track Web Analytics for specific websites or paths. If you do not configure any rules, Web Analytics injects the JavaScript (JS) snippet for all sites.

Rules are only available for sites proxied through Cloudflare. For more information, refer to [Limits](/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/limits/).

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select the **Analytics & Logs** drop-down and choose **Web Analytics**.
3. Find the site you want to configure and select **Manage site**.
4. Select **Advanced options** > **Add rule**.
5. Select the **Action** and fill in the hostname and path(s) you want to add a rule for.
6. If you want to add additional rules, select **Add rule**. Otherwise select **Update** to save the rule.
