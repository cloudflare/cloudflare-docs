# Enabling Cloudflare Web Analytics

## Sites not proxied through Cloudflare

1. Go to [Get started with Web Analytics](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/web-analytics).
2. Enter an Email address and password.
3. Click **Create Account**.
4. Enter your website’s hostname.
5. Copy the JS snippet.
6. Add the JS snippet to any of your website’s HTML pages before the ending body tag.
7. Click **Done**.
8. Wait for the redirect to the Web Analytics page or click **View Analytics**. It may take a few minutes for Web Analytics data to appear.

Repeat steps 4-8 for all of the websites you want to track with Web Analytics by going to **Quick Actions** > **Add a site** from the Web Analytics Sites page. From this page you can also click **Manage site** inside each website's card to adjust Web Analytics for your site at any time.

For more information on how many sites you can track, refer to [Limits](/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/limits/).

## Sites proxied through Cloudflare

    2. Select **Disable automatic setup**.
    3. Copy the JS snippet.
    4. Add the JS snippet to any of your website’s HTML pages before the ending body tag.
