# Dimensions

Dimensions are the labels used to describe different types of metrics or data. For example, `referers` is the data collected from external links referring visits to a page, while `browsers` shows which browsers accessed your website.

Below you will find a list of the different dimensions you can use to filter Web Analytics:

- **Referers**: The external links referring visits to a page.
- **Paths**: The links within your site referring visits to a page.
- **Hosts**: The domain of the site's URL.
- **Browsers**: The web browsers visitors use to access a page.
- **Operating systems**: The operating system visitors use to access a page.
- **Device types**: The device visitors use to access a page (for example, desktop, mobile, or tablet).
