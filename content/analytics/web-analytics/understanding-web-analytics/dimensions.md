# Dimensions

Dimensions are the labels used to describe different types of metrics or data. For example, _Referer_ is the data collected from external links referring visits to a page, while _Browser_ shows which browsers accessed your website.

Below you will find a list of the different dimensions you can use to filter Web Analytics:

- *Country*: The visitor's country.
- *Host*: The domain of the site's URL.
- *Path*: The links within your site referring visits to a page.
- *Referer*: The external links referring visits to a page. `referer` host is provided. Additionally, `referer` path is available from the GraphQL API.
- *Device type*: The device visitors use to access a page (for example, desktop, mobile, or tablet).
- *Browser*: The web browser visitors use to access a page.
- *Operating system*: The operating system visitors use to access a page.
- *Site*: The website's domain name. Used as for high-level segmentation of data. For example, you can use it for a particular zone or grey-clouded website.
