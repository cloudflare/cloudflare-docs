# Migration guides

## GraphQL migrations

If you are currently using the deprecated `httpRequests1mByColoGroups` or `httpRequests1dByColoGroups` GraphQL API nodes, the [HTTP Requests by Colo Groups to HTTP Requests by Adaptive Groups](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/graphql-api-analytics/) guide will help you migrate your queries to use the `httpRequestsAdaptiveGroups` node.

## Zone Analytics migrations

If you are currently using the [Zone Analytics API](/api/operations/zone-analytics-(-deprecated)-get-dashboard), the following guide will help you migrate your queries to the new GraphQL Analytics API:

*   [Zone Analytics to GraphQL Analytics](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/zone-analytics/)
*   [Zone Analytics Colos Endpoint to GraphQL Analytics](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/zone-analytics-colos/)

## Network Analytics migrations

If you are currently using the Network Analytics v1 (NAv1) GraphQL nodes, the [Network Analytics v1 to Network Analytics v2](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/network-analytics-v2/) guide will help you migrate your queries to the new Network Analytics v2.
