Cloudflare visualizes the metadata collected by our products in the Cloudflare dashboard. Refer to [Types of analytics](/fundamentals/data-products/types-of-analytics/) for more information about the various types of analytics and where they exist in the dashboard.

## Cloudflare Web Analytics

[Cloudflare Web Analytics](/analytics/web-analytics/) provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website without changing your DNS or using Cloudflareâ€™s proxy.

## GraphQL Analytics API

With the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/), all of your performance, security, and reliability data is available from one endpoint.
And you can select exactly what you need, from one metric for a domain to multiple metrics aggregated for your account.
