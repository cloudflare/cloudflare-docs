Web Analytics uses Cloudflare's Notification service. When enabled, Web Analytics sends you a weekly report with aggregate visits, page views and median page load time for all your sites, so you can monitor their performance.

To get started, add Web Analytics notification on your Cloudflare dashboard. Refer to [Cloudflare Notifications](/notifications/get-started/) to learn more.
