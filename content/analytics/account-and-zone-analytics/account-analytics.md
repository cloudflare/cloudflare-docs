# Account analytics (beta)

Cloudflare account analytics lets you access a wide range of aggregated metrics from all the sites under a specific Cloudflare account.

## View your account analytics

To view metrics for your site:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

2. Select the appropriate Cloudflare account.

3. Go to **Analytics & Logs** > **Account Analytics**.

Once it loads, the Account Analytics app displays a collection of categorized charts with aggregated metrics for your account. To understand the various metrics available, refer to _Review your account metrics_ below.

## Review your account metrics

This section outlines the aggregated metrics under each category.  Before reviewing your metrics, let’s define a couple of concepts used in some panels:

-   _Rate_ -  Reflects the ratio between the amount for a specific data category and the total.
-   _Bandwidth_ - Refers to the number of bytes sent from the Cloudflare edge network to the requesting client.

Also, note that:

-   To filter metrics for a specific time period, use the dropdown in the top right.
-   Most metrics are grouped into panels representing different aspects of the underlying data.

### Summary of metrics

Below is a brief description of the major elements comprising the metrics available.

#### HTTP Traffic

These charts aggregate data for HTTP traffic, and include:

-   An interactive map that breaks down the number of requests by country
-   A table combining numerical and spark line data, sorted by total number of requests per country
