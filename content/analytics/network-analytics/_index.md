# Cloudflare Network Analytics

Cloudflare Network Analytics v2 provides near real-time visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Network Analytics visualizes packet and bit-level data, the same data available via the Network Analytics v2 dataset of the GraphQL Analytics API.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The Network Analytics logs refer to IP traffic of Magic Transit customer prefixes/leased IP addresses or Spectrum applications. These logs are not directly associated with the [zones](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones) in your Cloudflare account.
