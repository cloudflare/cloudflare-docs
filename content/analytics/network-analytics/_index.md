# Cloudflare Network Analytics

Cloudflare Network Analytics v2 provides near real-time visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Network Analytics visualizes packet and bit-level data, the same data available via the Network Analytics v2 dataset of the GraphQL Analytics API.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
For guidance on the previous version of Network Analytics, refer to [Understanding Cloudflare Network Analytics v1](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360038696631) in the Support KB.
