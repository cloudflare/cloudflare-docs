# Cloudflare Network Analytics

Cloudflare Network Analytics v2 (beta) provides near real-time visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Network Analytics visualizes packet and bit-level data, the same data available via the Network Analytics v2 dataset of the GraphQL Analytics API.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The Network Analytics v2 dashboard is available in beta. For guidance on the Network Analytics v1 dashboard, refer to [Understanding Cloudflare Network Analytics v1](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360038696631) in the Support KB.
