# Get started

For Enterprise users who want to use Network Error Logging, sign up for the closed beta group.

1.  Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2.  Click **Analytics** > **Edge Reachability**.
3.  Under **Network Error Logging Monitoring**, click **Join the beta**.

After you sign up, Cloudflare will add your account and domain to a list of beta users and then enable Network Error Logging. If Network Error Logging has not been activated on your account after a week, contact your account team.
