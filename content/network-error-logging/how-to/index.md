# View Reports

Use NEL reports to view information such as:

1.  Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2.  Select **Analytics & Logs** > **Edge Reachability**.

Click a tab under **Reachability summary** to view specific information related to your Origin ASN, Origin, IP, or data center. Hover over a location on the map to view the number of reachable requests.
