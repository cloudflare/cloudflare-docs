# Dashes

Dashes look like hyphens, but are wider. An em dash is the widest type of dash. Dashes have a different purpose than hyphens. We use two types of dashes:

## Hyphen (-) 

**Hyphenate compound modifiers that are placed before the noun.** Compound modifiers that come before the noun require a hyphen to distinguish them from individual modifiers and nouns. Do not hyphenate compound modifiers that come after the noun. Hyphens are used in compound words and to express ranges.

Examples:

+ It takes 24-48 hours for the data to upload.

|✅|❌|Rationale|
|----|---|---|
|Protect your Internet property from common vulnerabilities with our enterprise-class Web Application Firewall (WAF).| Protect your Internet property from common vulnerabilities with our enterprise class Web Application Firewall (WAF). | ‘Enterprise-class’ refers to the ability of something to scale with and handle the needs of large enterprises. A hyphen is necessary because the compound modifier comes before the noun. |
|Our WAF is enterprise class. | Our WAF is enterprise-class. | ‘Enterprise class’ modifies ‘WAF.’ A hyphen is not necessary because the compound modifier comes after the noun. |

## Em dash (—)
**Use em dashes to break up thoughts within a single sentence.** Em dashes (—) or double dashes (--) with spaces around them may be used to break up thoughts within a sentence. Single dashes (-), or hyphens, are commonly used to write compound words/modifiers and should never be used to break up thoughts in this way.

Dashes are used in pairs (in place of parenthesis) or alone (in place of a semicolon or colon).

Examples: 

+ Cookies provide saved information about a user’s session to establish a “state” — in most cases, identity — as your browser makes a request.

+ Embed yourself in the team — the best results will come when trust is built.

Following AP style guides, and to improve readability, we include whitespaces before and after the em dash.
