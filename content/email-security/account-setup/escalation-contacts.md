# Escalation contacts

Whenever Area 1 finds an exceptional phishing threat or Email Service irregularity behavior (compromised email servers at a partner or vendor, wire fraud tactics, and more), we try to reach out to our customers.

You can enable these special notifications through an opt-in process:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Subscriptions** > **Escalation Contacts**.
4. Select **Add Contact**.
5. Fill out the form.
6. Select **Save**.

If you select **Critical Service Events**, the contact will be sent a text and/or an email message. They will need to select the link to confirm the subscriptions.
