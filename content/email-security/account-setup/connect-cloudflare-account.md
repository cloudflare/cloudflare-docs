# Connect a Cloudflare account

Existing Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) users must connect a Cloudflare account to access the new Zero Trust Cloud Email Security product.

## Connect account from the dashboard

To connect a Cloudflare account from the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

2. On the left bar, select **Area 1**.

3. Select **Launch dashboard**.
