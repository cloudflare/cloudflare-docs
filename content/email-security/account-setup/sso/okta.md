# Okta integration guide

In this tutorial you will learn how to connect your Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) account to Okta. When single sign-on (SSO) is correctly configured, your authorized employees can connect to the Cloud Email Security dashboard using a familiar user name and password.

## 1. Create an Cloud Email Security app in Okta

You will need to manually create an app for Cloud Email Security in Okta.

1. Log in to Okta as an administrator.

2. In the Admin console, go to **Applications** > **Applications**.

4. Enter a descriptive name for your app, such as `Cloud Email Security`, and select **Next**.

5. Enter the following settings for **SAML Settings**:

    | **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**     | `https://horizon.area1security.com/api/users/saml`                                          |

6. Select **Next**.

7. Under **Are you a customer or a partner?**, select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**.

8. In **App type**, select **This is an internal app that we have created**.

9. Select **Finish**.

10. Okta should display the app you have just created. If not, go to **Applications** > **Applications**, and select it.

11. In the **Sign On** tab, go to **View SAML setup instructions** and select it to retrieve the SAML provider information.

    ![Find the View SAML setup instructions button](/images/email-security/sso/okta/step11-saml-instructions.png)

12. Copy and save the link in **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL**. You will need it later to use in the Cloud Email Security dashboard.

    ![Copy and save the SSO URL to use later in the Cloud Email Security dashboard](/images/email-security/sso/okta/step12-sso-url.png)

13. Scroll down to **Optional**. You might need to enlarge the text box to copy and save all the XML data. You will need this information to  finish configuration in the Cloud Email Security dashboard. The start of the metadata should be similar to the following:

    ```txt
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><EntityDescriptor ID="_<YOUR_DESCRIPTOR_ID>" entityID="https://<YOUR_ENTITY_ID> " xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata">...
    ```
