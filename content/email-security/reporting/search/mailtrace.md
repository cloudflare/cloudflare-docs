# Mail Trace

**Mail Trace** allows you to search through and view all emails that have been processed by Area 1, whether or not they were marked with a [detection disposition](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

You would commonly use Mail Trace to review *whether* and *when* an email passed through Area 1, as well as *what* Area 1 communicated to the following mail provider.

To only review emails marked with a disposition, use [Detection Search](/email-security/reporting/search/detection-search/).
