# Phish reports

Email Security automatically generates {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="phishing">}}phish{{</glossary-tooltip>}} reports to provide an overview of your email traffic. The report only includes malicious emails. Spam and bulk emails are not included.

## In the dashboard

To view phishing reports in the Email Security dashboard, [log in](https://horizon.area1security.com/) and explore the non-Settings areas of the Email Security dashboard (**Home**, **Email**, **Web**, and **Detection Details**).

## Through an email subscription

The same reports that are visible through the dashboard can also be delivered through an email.

To subscribe an email address to daily or weekly reports:

1. Log in to the [Email Security dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Subscriptions** > **Email Subscriptions**.
4. Select **Add Subscriber**.
5. Enter an **Email** and choose the desired reports.
6. Select **Add Subscriber**.
