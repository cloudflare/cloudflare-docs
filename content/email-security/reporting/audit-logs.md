# Audit logs

You can use Area 1 logs to review actions performed on your account:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Users and Actions** > **Audit Log**.
4. Review the logs. You can also filter by type of log from the dropdown menu.

## Logs preview

You can use the Preview feature in Audit logs to check how Area 1 handles post delivery retractions. This functionality might be useful if you are not ready to deploy this automated feature to your organization.

When you review this type of audit log, Area 1 shows you the emails that would have been retracted post-delivery, with Post Delivery Response or Phish Submissions Response enabled. Refer to [Gmail retration](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/gmail-retraction/#post-delivery-retractions) or [Office 365 retractions](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/office365-retraction/#post-delivery-retractions) to learn more.

To review these preview logs:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Users and Actions** > **Audit Log**.
4. From the dropdown, select one of the **Preview** logs. This will show you what would have been retracted with Post Delivery Response or Phish Submission Response enabled.
