# Reporting

Area 1 offers a variety of ways for you to better examine and understand your message traffic:

- [Detection Search](/email-security/reporting/search/detection-search/) and [Mail Trace](/email-security/reporting/search/mailtrace/) let you search for specific messages within the dashboard. You can also opt for the new [Unified Search](/email-security/reporting/search/unified-search/) experience, which merges Detection Search and Mail Trace into a single, unified experience.
- [Phish Reports](/email-security/reporting/phish-reports/) are accessible through the dashboard or through an email digest.
- [SIEM integrations](/email-security/reporting/siem-integration/) allow you to view message-level information outside of the dashboard and create your own custom reports.
- The [Area 1 API](/email-security/api/) also allows you to download historical records as needed.
