# API

Area 1 offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to expose our phishing campaign rulesets. These APIs both aid research and provide a set of indicators to block using network security edge devices.

All API requests are initiated using normal HTTP requests (`GET`/`POST`/`DELETE`) and responses are returned in JSON. Authentication to the APIs uses HTTP Basic Authentication over HTTPS.

For more details, refer to our [API documentation (PDF)](/email-security/static/api_documentation_1.37.pdf).
