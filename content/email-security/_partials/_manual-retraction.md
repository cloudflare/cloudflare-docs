2. Select the search bar and enter the search parameters to find the emails you are looking for.

3. To retract a single message, select **Retract**. To retract multiple messages, first select the checkboxes on the messages you want to retract. Then, select **Retract**.

4. Choose where you want to retract the message to, and select **Retract message**.
