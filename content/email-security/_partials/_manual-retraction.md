3. This will update the search dialog and allow you to search for the messages to retract. Enter the search parameters to find the emails you are looking for.

4. To retract a single message, select the three dots next to the message, and select **Retract**. To retract multiple messages, first select the checkboxes on the messages you want to retract. Then, select the three dots > **Retract**.
