Phishing is the root cause of upwards of 90% of breaches that lead to financial loss and brand damage. Cloudflare Area 1 email security is a cloud-native service that stops phishing attacks across all threat vectors either at the [edge](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/) or in the cloud.

With globally distributed sensors and comprehensive attack analytics, Area 1 proactively identifies phishing campaigns, attacker infrastructure, and attack delivery mechanisms during the earliest stages of a phishing attack cycle. Using flexible enforcement platforms, the Area 1 solution allows customers to take preemptive action against targeted phishing, including malware, spoofing attacks, payload-less Business Email Compromise attacks, supply chain phishing, and other advanced threats.
