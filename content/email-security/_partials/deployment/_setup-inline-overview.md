With an **Inline deployment** for your [Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) setup](/email-security/deployment/), Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) evaluates email messages before they reach a user's inbox.

More technically, Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) becomes a hop in the {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="SMTP">}}SMTP{{</glossary-tooltip>}} processing chain and physically interacts with incoming email messages. Based on your policies, various messages are blocked before reaching the inbox.

## Benefits

When you choose an inline deployment, you get the following benefits:

- Messages are processed and physically blocked before delivery to a user's mailbox.
- Your deployment is simpler, because any complex processing can happen downstream and without modification.
- Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) can [modify delivered messages](/email-security/email-configuration/email-policies/text-addons/), adding subject or body mark-ups.
- Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) can offer high availability and adaptive message pooling.
- You can set up advanced handling downstream for non-quarantined messages with [added `X-headers`](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

## Limitations

Inline deployments are not without their disadvantages. If you deploy Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) as your MX record, you will have to make changes to your DNS. If not — and you deploy Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) after your MX record — you will have a more complex SMTP architecture.

Additionally, this setup may require policy duplication on multiple solutions and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
