# API deployment setup

When you first get started with Area 1, you will need to set up a way to connect your current mail environment with Area 1.

## BCC setup

Send messages to Area 1 via BCC configurations within your email provider:

- [GSuite BCC Setup](/email-security/static/GSuite-BCC-Setup.pdf)
- [Office 365 BCC Setup](/email-security/static/O365_Bcc_setup.pdf)

## Journalling setup

Send messages to Area 1 via a Journalling configuration within your email provider:

- [GSuite Journalling Setup](/email-security/static/GSuite-Journalling-Setup.pdf)
- [Office 365 Journalling Setup](/email-security/static/Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_O365_using_Journaling.pdf)

## Next steps

Regardless of your setup (BCC or Journalling), you may also want to set up either manual or automatic [retraction](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/) to take post-delivery actions against suspicious messages.
