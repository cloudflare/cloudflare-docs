# Microsoft Exchange BCC setup with Area 1

For customers using Microsoft Exchange, setting up Area 1 via BCC is quick and easy. You need to configure an inbound rule to send emails to Area 1 via BCC for processing and detection of potential phishing attacks. The following email flow shows how this works:

## Configure Inbound Rule

1. Access Exchange's **Management Console**, and go to **Organization Configuration** > **Hub Transport**.

2. On the **Actions** pane, select **New Transport Rule**.

3. Give the transport rule a name and a description and select **Next**.

5. Still in the same **Condition** configuration panel, add a second condition to the transport rule. Select **sent to users that are inside or outside the organization, or partners**. Keep the default value of **Inside the organization**.

10. Select **OK** > **OK** to return to the main configuration page of the transport rule.

11. At the main configuration page of the transport rule, select **Next** to continue to the Exception configuration panel.

12. You do not need to configure an exception rule. Select **Next**.

13. In **Create Rule**, select the **New** button.

    ![Select the new button](/email-security/static/deployment/api-setup/exchange/step13.png)

{{<Aside type="note">}}
If you have multiple rules, you may need to change the order of the BCC rule and move it to the right location in your rule sequence. This is needed so you can send BCC messages to Area 1. Usually, the Area 1 BCC rule will be at the top of the ruleset. The configured conditions of the Area 1 BCC rule will only trigger for inbound messages.

## Email processing and reports

In BCC mode, all emails are put through automated phishing detections by Area 1. Emails that trigger phishing detections are logged for reporting via product portal, email and Slack. Emails that do not trigger any detections are deleted.
