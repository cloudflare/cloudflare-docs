# Microsoft Office 365 journaling setup with Area 1

For customers using Microsoft Office 365, setting up a phishing risk assessment with Area 1 and a journaling setup is quick and easy. The following email flow shows how this works:

## 1. Configure connector for delivery to Area 1 (if required)

If your email architecture does not include an outbound gateway, you can skip this step and proceed to the next one.

On the other hand, if your email architecture requires outbound messages to traverse your email gateway, you may want to consider configuring a connector to send the journal messages directly to Area 1.

1. From the [Exchange admin center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com), go to **Mail flow** > **Connectors**.

2. Select **+ Add a connector**. 

3. Configure the new connector as follows:
    * **Connection From**: Office 365
    * **Connection to**: Partner Organization

4. Select **Next**.

5. Configure the connector name and description as follows:
    * **Name**: `Deliver journal directly to Area 1`
    * **Description**: `Deliver journal directly to Area 1`
    * Select the **Turn it on** checkbox.

6. Select **Next**.

7. Configure the **Use of connector** setting as follows:
    * Select **Only when email messages are sent to these domains**.
    * In the text field, enter `journaling.mxrecord.io`, and select **+** to add the domain.

8. Select **Next**.

9. Configure the Routing setting as follows:
    * Select **Route email through these smart hosts**.
    * In the text field, enter the following smarthosts. Select the **+** button after each host to add it to the configuration:
        * `mailstream-east.mxrecord.io`
        * `mailstream-west.mxrecord.io`
    * If there is a requirement to enforce traffic through the EU region, use the following smarthost instead:
        * `mailstream-eu1.mxrecord.io`

10. Select **Next**.

11. In Security restrictions, you need to preserve the default TLS configuration. Review the following settings:
    * Make sure the **Always use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the connection (recommended)** checkbox is selected.
    * In **Connect only if the recipients email server certificate matches this criteria** select **Issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA)**.

12. Select **Next**.

13. You need to validate the connector by using your tenantâ€™s specific journaling address. To find this address, go to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/support/service-addresses) **Support** > **Service Addresses page**. 

14. Add the address and select **Validate**.

15. Once the validation completes, you should receive a **Succeeded** status for all the tasks. Select **Next**.

16. Review the configuration and select **Create connector**.

Your connector is now active. You can find it in **Exchange admin center** > **Mail flow** > **Connectors**.

## 2. Configure journal rule

1. Go to the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/homepage).

2. Navigate to **Purview compliance portal** > **Data lifecycle management** > **Exchange (legacy)**.

3. Select **Settings** (the gear icon).

4. In **Send undeliverable journal reports to** enter the email address for a valid user account. Note that you cannot use a team or group address.

5. Select **Save**. 

6. Still in the Exchange (legacy) screen, select **Journal Rules**.

7. Select **New rule** to configure a journaling rule, and configure it as follows:

    * **Send journal reports to**: This address is specific to each customer tenant, and can be found in your [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/support/service-addresses). If you are located in the EU or GDPR applies to your organization, ensure you are using a connector with the smarthost set to `mailstream-eu1.mxrecord.io`. Refer to step 9 of [Configure connector for delivery to Area 1](#1-configure-connector-for-delivery-to-area-1-if-required) for more information.
    * **Journal Rule Name**: `Journal Messages to CloudflareArea 1`
    * **Journal messages sent or received from**: Everyone. 
        * If you wish to restrict this rule to specific users or groups select **A specific user or group**, and select the list of users/groups from the window that opens.
    * **Type of message to journal**: External messages only

8. Select **Next**.

9. Verify the information is correct, and select **Submit** > **Done**. 

Once saved, the rule is automatically active. However, it may take a few minutes for the configuration to propagate and start pushing messages to Cloudflare Area 1. After it propagates, you can access the Cloudflare Area 1 dashboard to check the number of messages processed. This number will grow as journaled messages are sent to Cloudflare Area 1 from your Exchange server.

## Create a distribution group in Office 365

If you do not have a distribution group yet, follow these steps to create one.

2. Select **Add a group** > **Distribution**.

3. Select **Next**.

4. In **Group email address** enter a name for your distribution group.

5. Select **Next** > **Create Group**.

6. In **Active groups** navigate to the distribution group you have just created.

7. Select it to add the users you want to have in that distribution group.
