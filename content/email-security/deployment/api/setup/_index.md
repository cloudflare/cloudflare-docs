# API deployment setup

When you first get started with Area 1, you will need to set up a way to connect your current mail environment with Area 1.

## BCC setup

Send messages to Area 1 via BCC configurations within your email provider:

   - [GSuite BCC Setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/gsuite-bcc-setup)
   - [Microsoft Exchange BCC Setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/exchange-bcc-setup)

## Journalling setup

 Send messages to Area 1 via a Journalling configuration within your email provider:

   - [Office 365 Journalling Setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/office365-journaling)

## Next steps

Regardless of your setup (BCC or Journalling), you may also want to set up either manual or automatic [retraction](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/) to take post-delivery actions against suspicious messages.
