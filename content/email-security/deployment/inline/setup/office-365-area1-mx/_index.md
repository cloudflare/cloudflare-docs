# Deploy and configure Microsoft Office 365 with Area 1 as MX Record

![A schematic showing where Area 1 security is in the life cycle of an email received](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/office365-mx.png)

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure Microsoft Office 365 with Area 1 as MX record. This tutorial is broken down into several steps.

## Prerequisites

To ensure changes made in this tutorial take effect quickly, update the Time to Live (TTL) value of the existing MX records on your domains to five minutes. Do this on all the domains you will be deploying. 

Changing the TTL value instructs DNS servers on how long to cache this value before requesting an update from the responsible name server. You need to change the TTL value before changing your MX records to Cloudlfare Area 1. This will ensure that changes take effect quickly and can also be reverted quickly if needed. If your DNS Manager does not allow for a TTL of five minutes, set it to the lowest possible setting.

To check your existing TTL, open a terminal window and run the following command against your domain:

```sh
$ dig mx <YOUR_DOMAIN>

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> mx <YOUR_DOMAIN>
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 39938
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 5, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;domain.		IN	MX

;; ANSWER SECTION:
<YOUR_DOMAIN>.	300	IN	MX	10 mailstream-east.mxrecord.io.
<YOUR_DOMAIN>.	300	IN	MX	10 mailstream-west.mxrecord.io.
<YOUR_DOMAIN>.	300	IN	MX	20 mailstream-central.mxrecord.mx.
```

In the above example, TTL is shown in seconds as `300` (or five minutes). 

If you are using Cloudflare for DNS, you can leave the [TTL setting as **Auto**](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/).

Bellow is a list with instrunctions on how to edit MX records for some popular services:

- **Cloudflare**: [Set up email records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/email-records/)
- **GoDaddy**: [Edit an MX Record](https://www.godaddy.com/help/edit-an-mx-record-19235)
- **AWS**: [Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html)
- **Azure**: [Create DNS records in a custom domain for a web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-web-sites-custom-domain)



## 1. Add Area 1 IP addresses to Allow List

1. Go to the [Microsoft Security admin center](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage).

2. Go to **Policies & Rules** > **Threat policies**.

3. Select the [Anti-spam option](https://security.microsoft.com/antispam).
    
    <div class="large-img">
    
    ![Select the anti-spam option](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step3-anti-spam.png)

    </div>

4. Select **Connection filter policy (Default)** > **Edit connection filter policy**.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Select edit connection filter policy](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step4-edit-filter-policy.png)

    </div>

5. In **Always allow messages from the following IP addresses or address range** add the IP addresses and CIDR blocks mentioned in [Egress IPs](/email-security/deployment/inline/reference/egress-ips/).

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Enter the egress IP addresses](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step5-egress-ips.png)

    </div>
6. Select **Save**.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Depending on your Office 365 configuration, you may receive a warning indicating that you need to run the `Enable-OrganizationCustomization` cmdlet before you create or modify objects in your Exchange Online organization. Follow the next step to enable this cmdlet.
{{</Aside>}}

7. Microsoft recommends disabling SPF Hard fail when an email solution is placed in front of it. Return to the [Anti-spam option](https://security.microsoft.com/antispam).

8. Select **Anti-spam inbound policy (Default)**.

9. At the end of the **Bulk email threshold & spam properties** section, select **Edit spam threshold and properties**.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Select the spam threshold and properties button](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step9-spam-threshold.png)

    </div>

10. Scroll to **Mark as spam** > **SPF record: hard fail**, and ensure it is set to **Off**.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Make sure SPF record: hard fail is set to off](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step10-spf-record-hard-fail.png)

    </div>

11. Select **Save**.

## 2. Enhanced Filtering configuration

This option will allow Office 365 to properly identify the original connecting IP before the message was received by Area 1. This helps with SPF analysis. This has two steps: 

* Creating an inbound connector.
* Enabling the enhanced filtering configuration of the connector.

### Create an inbound connector

1. Go to the new [**Exchange admin center**](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/homepage).

2. Select **Mail flow** > **Connectors**.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Select Connectors from Mail flow](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step2-mailflow-conectors.png)

    </div>

3. Select **Add a connector**.

4. In **Connection from**, select **Partner organization**.

5. Select **Next**.

6. Set the following options:
    - **Name** - `Area 1 Inbound Connector`
    - **Description** - `Inbound connector for Enhanced Filtering`

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Enter a name and descriptions for your connector](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step6-connector-options.png)

    </div>

7. Select **Next**.

8. In **Authenticating sent email**, select **By verifying that the IP address of the sending server matches one of the following IP addresses, which belongs to your partner organization.**

9. Enter all of the egress IPs in the [Egress IPs](/email-security/deployment/inline/reference/egress-ips/) page.

    <div class="large-img">
    
    ![Enter all of Area 1's Egress IPs](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step9-egress-ips.png)

    </div>
    
10. Select **Next**.

11. In **Security restrictions**, accept the default **Reject email messages if they aren't sent over TLS** setting, and select **Next**.

12. Review your settings and select **Create connector**.

### Enable enhanced filtering

Now that the inbound connector has been configured, you will need to enable the enhanced filtering configuration of the connector in the [Security admin console](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage).

1. Go to [Security Admin console](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage) > **Policy & Rules** > **Threat policies**.

2. Under **Rules**, select **Enhanced filtering**.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Go to Enhanced filtering](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step2-enhanced-filtering.png)

    </div>

2. Select the `Area 1 Inbound Connector`, the connector you configured previously to edit its configuration parameters. 

3. Select **Automatically detect and skip the last IP address** and **Apply to entire organization**.

    ![Select Automatically detect and skip the last IP address, and Apply to entire organization](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step3-selectors.png)

4. Select **Save**.

## 3. Configure Area 1 quarantine policies

### Select the disposition that you want to quarantine

Quarantining messages is a per domain configuration. To modify which domains will have their message quarantined, access the domain configuration: 

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).

2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon) > **Domains**.

3. Locate the domain you want to edit.

4. Select the `...` icon > **Edit**.

5. Select the additional dispositions you want to quarantine.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Manage domain quarantines](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step4-area1-dispositions.png)

    </div>

{{<Aside type="note">}}When Area 1 is deployed as the MX record and protecting Office 365, `Malicious` and `Spam` detections will automatically be quarantined. This behavior cannot be modified.{{</Aside>}}

### Manage the Admin Quarantine

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).

2. Go to **Email** > **Admin Quarantine**.

3. Locate the message you want to manage, and select the `...` icon next to it. Thill will let you preview, download, or release the quarantined message.

    <div class="large-img">

    ![Manage admin quarantines](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step4-manage-admin-quarantine.png)

    </div>

## 4. Message handling

There may be scenarios where use of the O365 email quarantines or a combination with Area 1 is preferred. The following are the best practices for using the O365 quarantine. The recommendations [by disposition](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/) are as follows:

- `MALICIOUS`: Should always be quarantined. If the user requires notification, they should require administrator approval to release. Users should never have the ability to self remediate `MALICIOUS` emails without approval from an administrator. Emails should be body and subject tagged.
- `SUSPICIOUS`: Should not be quarantined. Emails should be body and subject tagged. Emails should be delivered to the userâ€™s inbox or junk mail folder. Advantage customers should `DEFANG` this disposition while all Enterprise customers should always enable [Email Link Isolation](/email-security/email-configuration/email-policies/link-actions/#email-link-isolation-beta).
- `SPAM` - Should always be quarantined. If the user requires notification, they may or may not require administrator approval to release. Emails should be subject tagged.
- `BULK` - Should not be quarantined. Emails should be subject tagged and delivered to the inbox or junk mail folder.
- `SPOOF` - If `SPOOF` detections are clean and well managed in the Allow List, emails should always be quarantined. If the `SPOOF` detections are not clean, they should be treated the same as `SPAM` if you have [Enhanced Detections](/email-security/email-configuration/enhanced-detections/) configured. If not, `SPOOF` detections should be treated as `BULK`. Emails should be body and subject tagged. In our example we will treat SPOOF the same as SPAM.

Within O365 there are various options as well as limitations as to how quarantine email messages. The primary options will be broken down into use cases you may use for yourself as examples. The Area 1 dashboard has an [Admin quarantine](/email-security/email-configuration/admin-quarantine/). Use of the O365 quarantine is an option for when a user quarantine is needed. While there are many quarantine options, the following are the primary use cases this guide will cover.

- Use Case 1: Deliver to Junk Email folder and Admin Quarantine in Area 1 (Recommended)
- Use Case 2: Deliver to Junk Email folder and User Managed Quarantine
    - This use case requires that `MALICIOUS` emails be quarantined within the Area 1 product.
- Use Case 3: Deliver to Junk Email folder and User Quarantine requiring Admin Release
- Use Case 4: User Managed Quarantine and User Quarantine requiring Admin Release
- Use Case 5: Deliver to Junk Email dolder and Admin Managed Host Quarantine

### Best practices

Before looking into our use case tutorials, read throught this how-to guide related to best practices. This will show you how to prepare your Area 1 dashboard and enable options such as tagging and defanging emails, as well as [Email Link Isolation](/email-security/email-configuration/email-policies/link-actions/#email-link-isolation-beta), before setting up Office 365.

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).

2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).

3. Navigate to **Email Configuration** > **Email Policies** > **Link Actions**.

4. If you are an **Advantage customer**:
    1. In **Disposition Actions**, select **Edit**.
    2. In the `SUSPICIOUS` disposition drop-down menu, change the action to `URL DEFANG`.

    <div class="medium-img">

    ![Defang suspicious emails](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/defang-suspicious.png)

    </div>

    3. Select **Save Disposition Actions**.

5. If you are an **Enterprise customer**:
    1. Enable **Email Link Isolation**.

6. Still under **Email Policies**, select **Text add-Ons**.

7. Select **Edit**.

8. Enable the following options under **Add Prefix To Subject**:
    - **Malicious** - Enabled
    - **Suspicious** - Enabled
    - **Spam** - Enabled
    - **Bulk** - Enabled
    - **Spoof** - Enabled
    - **Originated Outside of Company** - Optional
    - **Contains Encrypted Content** - Optional
    - **Subject Prefix** - Format as desired. For example `[%LABELS]`

    <div class="medium-img">

    ![Enable all the options mentioned in step 9](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/prefix-subject.png)

    </div>

9. Still in the same window, scroll down and enable the following options under **Add Prefix To Body**:
    - **Malicious** - Enabled
    - **Suspicious** - Enabled
    - **Spam** - Disabled
    - **Bulk** - Disabled
    - **Spoof** - Enabled
    - **Originated Outside of Company** - Optional
    - **Body Prefix** - Format as desired. You can use the default settings. The body prefix supports HTML tags for formatting.

    <div class="medium-img">

    ![Enable all the options mentioned in step 7](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/prefix-subject-enterprise.png)

    </div>

10. Select **Update Text Add-Ons**.

### Use cases

Refer to [Use cases](/email-security/deployment/inline/setup/office-365-area1-mx/use-cases/) to learn how to set up your environment for different scenarios.

## 5. Update your domain MX records

Instructions to update your MX records will depend on the DNS provider you are using. You will need to update and replace your existing MX record with the Area 1 hosts:

MX Priority | Host
--- | ---
`10` | `mailstream-east.mxrecord.io`
`10` | `mailstream-west.mxrecord.io`
`20` | `mailstream-central.mxrecord.mx`

When configuring the Area 1 MX records, it is important to configure hosts with the correct MX priority. This will allow mail flows to the preferred hosts and fail over as needed.

If you are located in Europe or GDPR applies to the domain, use the following MX records. This will prioritize email flow through Germany and fail over to the United States.

MX Priority | Host
--- | --
`5` | `mailstream-eu1.mxrecord.io`
`10` | `mailstream-east.mxrecord.io`
`10` | `mailstream-west.mxrecord.io`
`20` | `mailstream-central.mxrecord.mx`


Once the MX records have been updated with the new MX records, delete your old MX records and leave only the ones above. DNS updates may take up to 36 hours to fully propagate around the Internet. Some of the faster DNS providers will start to update records within minutes. DNS changes will reach the major DNS servers in about an hour or follow the TTL as described in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

### Secure Office 365 from MX records bypass (recommended)

One method of attack is to lookup old MX records and send phishing emails directly to the mail server. To secure the email flow, you will want to enforce that inbound messages are accepted by Office 365 only when they originate from Area 1. This can be done by adding a connector to only allow email from Area 1 with TLS encription. This step is optional but recommended.

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Important">}}
This step should not be performed until 24 hours after all domains (excluding your `<on_microsoft.com>` domain) in your Office 365 organization have been onboarded to Area 1, and Area 1 is their MX record. If a domain has not been onboarded or DNS is still propagating, you will impact production email flow for that domain.
{{</Aside>}}

#### Configure domains

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/). 

2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).

3. In **Email Configuration** > **Domains**, make sure each domain you are onboarding has been added.

4. Set the following options for each domain:
    - **Domain**: `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`
    - **Configured as**: `MX Records`
    - **Forwarding to**: This should match the expected MX for each domain in Office 365 at [https://admin.microsoft.com/#/Domains/](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/Domains/)
    - **IP Restrictions**: Leave empty
    - **Outbound TLS**: `Forward all messages over TLS`
    - **Quarantine Policy**: Varies by deployment.

#### Create Connector

1. Go to the new [Exchange admin center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/homepage).
2. Go to **Mail flow** > **Connectors**.
3. Select **Add a connector**.
4. Select **Connection from** > **Partner organization**.
5. Select **Next**.
6. Set the following options:
    - **Name** - `Secure O365 Inbound`
    - **Description** - `Only accept inbound email from Area 1`
7. Select **Next**.
8. Leave the first option selected - **Verify that the sender domain matches one of the following domains**.
9. Enter `*` in the text field, and select `+`.
10. Select **Next**.
11. Select **Reject email messages if they arenâ€™t sent from within this IP address range**.
12. Enter all of the egress IPs in the [Egress IPs page](/email-security/deployment/inline/reference/egress-ips/).
13. Select **Next**.
14. Review your settings and select **Create connector**.

## 6: Execute `Enable-OrganizationCustomization` (if required)

The following steps are only required if you have not previously customized your Office 365 instance. If you received the message to run this cmdlet in any of the previous steps, you will need to execute it in order to proceed with the configuration. This change may take as long as 24 hours to take effect.

1. Run PowerShell as administrator, and execute the following command. Reply `Yes` when prompted:

```txt
PS C:\Windows\system32> Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
```

![Run the install-module command in PowerShell](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step1-install-module.png)

{{<Aside type="note">}}This module is a Microsoft module.{{</Aside>}}

2. Run the following commands to execute the policy change and connect to the Office 365 instance:

    ```txt
    PS C:\Windows\system32> set-executionpolicy remotesigned
    ```

    Confirm that you want to execute the policy change, and then run the following command:

    ```txt
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
    ```

    Finally, run the following to authenticate against your Office 365 instance:

    ```txt
    PS C:\Windows\system32> Connect-ExchangeOnline
    ```

    ![Run the commands to execute the policy change](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step2-set-executionpolicy.png)

3. The `Connect-ExchangeOnline` cmdlet will prompt you to login. Log in using an Office 365 administrator account. Once authenticated, you will be returned to the PowerShell prompt.

    ![Log in with an Office 365 admin account](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step3-connect-exchange.png)

4. You can verify that the `OrganizationCustomization` is enabled by running the command:

```txt
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-OrganizationConfig | FL isDehydrated
```

![Run the get-organizationconfig command](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step4-get-organizationconfig.png)

If the result is `false`, `OrganizationCustomization` is already enabled and no further actions are required. If it is true, you need to enable it:

```txt
PS C:\> Enable-OrganizationCustomization
```

![If the previous result is true, enable the organization customization mode](/email-security/static/inline-setup/o365-area1-mx/step4-enable-organizationcustomization.png)
