# Deploy and configure Google Workspace with Area 1 as MX Record

![A schematic showing where Area 1 security is in the life cycle of an email received](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/gsuite-area1-mx.png)

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure Google Workspace with Area 1 as MX record. This tutorial is broken down into several steps.

{{<render file="_outbound-email.md">}}

## Requirements

* Provisioned Area 1 account.
* Access to the Google administrator console ([**Google administrator console**](https://admin.google.com) > **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail**).
* Access to the domain nameserver hosting the MX records for the domains that will be processed by Area 1.

{{<render file="_mx-deployment-prerequisites.md">}}

## 1. Add Area 1 IP addresses to the Inbound gateway configuration

When Area 1 is deployed as the MX record for Google Workspace, the Inbound gateway needs to be configured such that Google Workspace is aware that it is no longer the MX record for the domain. This is a critical step as it will allow Google Workspace to accept messages from Area 1.

1. Go to the [Google Administrative Console](https://admin.google.com/).

2. Go to **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail**.

    ![Access Gmail](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step2-gmail.png)

3. Select **Spam, Phishing, and Malware** and scroll to **Inbound Gateway configuration**.

    ![Access the spam, phishing and malware setting](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step3-spam.png)

4. Enable **Inbound Gateway**, and configure it with the following details:

    ![Enable inbound gateway](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step4-inbound-gateway.png)

    * In **Gateway IPs**, select the **Add** link, and add the IPs mentioned in [Egress IPs](/email-security/deployment/inline/reference/egress-ips/).
    * Select **Automatically detect external IP (recommended)**.
    * Select **Require TLS for connections from the email gateways listed above**.

{{<Aside type="note">}}Do not select **Reject all mail not from gateway IPs** until the MX records have fully propagated. [Refer to step 4](#4-secure-your-email-flow) for more details.{{</Aside>}}

5. Select the **Save** button at the bottom of the dialog box to save the configuration once the details have been entered. Once saved, the administrator console will show the Inbound Gateway as **enabled**.

## 2. Quarantine malicious detections

This optional step is highly recommended to prevent users from being exposed to malicious messages.

When messages are identified as malicious, Area 1 will insert the X-header `X-Area1Security-Disposition` into the message with the corresponding disposition. Based on the value of the `X-Area1Security-Disposition`, a content compliance filter can be configured to send malicious detections to an administrative quarantine. This section will outline the steps required to:
* Create an Area 1 Malicious quarantine.
* Create the content compliance filter to send malicious messages to quarantine.

### Create Area 1 Malicious Quarantine

If you would like to send Area 1 malicious detection to a separate quarantine other than the default quarantine, you will need to create a new quarantine.

1. In [Google's administrative console](https://admin.google.com), select the **Manage quarantines** panel.

    ![Select the manage quarantines panel](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step1-manage-quarantines.png)

2. Select **ADD QUARANTINE** to configure the new quarantine. This will bring up a pop-up for the configuration details.

    ![Select the add quarantine button](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step2-add-quarantine.png)

3. In the quarantine configuration pop-up, enter the following:

    * **Name**: `Area 1 Malicious`.
    * **Description**: `Area 1 Malicious`.
    * For the **Inbound denial consequence**, select **Drop Message**.
    * For the **Outbound denial consequence**, select **Drop Message**.

    <div class="medium-img">

    ![Configure the quarantine settings](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step3-configure-quarantine.png)

    </div>

When you are finished entering these details, select **SAVE**.

4. To access the newly create quarantine, select **GO TO ADMIN QUARANTINE** or access the quarantine directly by pointing your browser to [https://email-quarantine.google.com/adminreview](https://email-quarantine.google.com/adminreview).

    ![Access the quarantine created](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step4-access-quarantine.png)

    Once in the Admin quarantine console, you can access the **Area 1 Malicious** quarantine by selecting **Quarantine:ALL** > **Area 1 Malicious** in the filter section. Quarantined messages can be released as needed by an administrator.

### Create a content compliance filter to send malicious messages to quarantine

1. In [Google's administrative console](https://admin.google.com), select **Compliance** to configure the content compliance filter.

    ![Access the compliance configuration](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step1-compliance.png)

2. Go to the **Content compliance** area and select **CONFIGURE** to open the configuration dialog pop-up.

    ![Select the configure button](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step2-configure.png)

3. In the **Content compliance filter** configuration, enter the following:

    * **Name**: `Quarantine Area 1 Malicious`.
    * In **1. Email message to affect**, select **Inbound**.
    * In **2. Add expression that describe the content you want to search for in each message**:
        * Select **Add** to add the condition.
            * In the *Simple content match* dropdown, select **Advanced content match**.
            * In **Location**, select **Full headers**.
            * In **Match type**, select **Contains text**.
            * In **Content**, enter `X-Area1Security-Disposition: MALICIOUS`.
        * Select **SAVE** to save the condition.
    * In **3. If the above expression match, do the following**, select the *Action* dropdown. Then choose **Quarantine message** and the **Area 1 Malicious** quarantine that was created in the previous step.

    <div class="medium-img">

    ![Configure the compliance filter](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step3-compliance-filter.png)

    </div>

    After you enter this information, select **SAVE**.

4. Once saved, the console will update with the newly configured **content compliance filter**.

    ![After configuration, the console shows the content compliance filter](/email-security/static/deployment/inline-setup/gsuite-area1-mx/step4-compliance-filter.png)

    If you would like to quarantine the other dispositions, repeat the above steps and use the following strings for the other dispositions:
    * `X-Area1Security-Disposition: MALICIOUS`
    * `X-Area1Security-Disposition: SUSPICIOUS`
    * `X-Area1Security-Disposition: SPOOF`
    * `X-Area1Security-Disposition: UCE`

    If desired, you can create a separate quarantine for each of the dispositions.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Google handles Groups (that is, distributions lists) differently from user mail accounts. The compliance filters actions are limited to the **Users** account type. If you heavily use Google Groups (that is, distribution lists), quarantining malicious messages using the Area 1 quarantine is the recommended method to ensure full protection.
{{</Aside>}}

## 3. Update your domain MX records

Instructions to update your MX records will depend on the DNS provider you are using. You need to replace the existing Google MX records with the Area 1 hosts.

These are the typical default MX records when using Google Workspace:

MX Priority | Host
----------- | ---
`1`           | `aspmx.l.google.com`
`5`           | `alt1.aspmx.l.google.com`
`5`           | `alt2.aspmx.l.google.com`
`10`          | `alt3.aspmx.l.google.com`
`10`          | `alt4.aspmx.l.google.com`

To update your MX records with Area 1, use the following:

{{<render file="_mx-deployment-values.md">}}

DNS changes will reach the major DNS servers in about an hour or follow the TTL value as described in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

## 4. Secure your email flow

After 36 hours, the MX record DNS update will have sufficiently propagated across the Internet. It is now safe to secure your email flow. This will ensure that Google only accepts messages that are first received by Area 1. This step is highly recommended to prevent threat actors from using cached MX entries to bypass Area 1 by injecting messages directly into Gmail.

1. Access the [Google Administrative Console](https://admin.google.com/), then select **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail**.

2. Select **Spam, Phishing, and Malware**.

3. Go to **Inbound Gateway configuration** and select **Configure**.

4. Enable **Reject all mail not from gateway IPs** and select **Save**.

5. Select **Save** once more to commit and activate the configuration change in the Gmail advanced configuration console.

## 5. Send Area 1 spam to user spam folder (optional)

Unlike the configuration in [step 2](#2-quarantine-malicious-detections) where the message can be sent to an administrative quarantine, this optional step can be configured to send messages that are identified as spam by Area 1 to the user’s spam folder. 

1. Access [Google's Administrative Console](https://admin.google.com/), then select **Apps** > **Google Workspace** > **Gmail**.

2. Select **Spam, Phishing, and Malware**.

3. Go to **Inbound Gateway configuration** and select **Configure**.

4. In the **Message Tagging** section, select **Message is considered spam if the following header regexp matches**.

5. In the **Regexp** section, enter the string `X-Area1Security-Disposition: UCE`.

6. Select **SAVE** to save the updated configuration.
