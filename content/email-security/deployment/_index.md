## Missed phish

Another crucial aspect to your Area 1 setup is sending missed phish samples to Cloudflare. Sending phish samples to Cloudflare should be a part of your continuous email security posture.

Submitting missed phish samples to Cloudflare is of paramount importance and necessary for continuous protection as it helps us improve our machine learning (ML) models and alerts us of new attack vectors before they become prevalent.

Refer to [Phish submissions](/email-security/email-configuration/phish-submissions/) for more information.
