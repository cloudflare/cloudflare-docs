# Setup

When you configure Area 1 Email Security to protect your organization, you can choose between two main setup architectures: Inline and API.

With an Inline deployment, Area 1 evaluates email messages before they reach a user’s inbox. When you choose an API deployment, email messages only reach Area 1 after they have already reached a user’s inbox.

Select a deployment method to get started.
