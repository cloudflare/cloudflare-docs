You can use your Cloudflare account as the single sign-on (SSO) authentication scheme to log in to the Cloud Email Security dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Select **Sign in with Cloudflare**. You will be redirected to your Cloudflare account to log in.
3. Select **Allow** to allow Cloud Email Security to make changes to your Cloudflare account. You will be redirected to Cloud Email Security dashboard.
4. Enter your Cloud Email Security's email address to log in.

You can now use your Cloudflare account as a single sign-on authentication scheme to log in to Cloud Email Security. The next time you access the Cloud Email Security dashboard, just select **Sign in with Cloudflare** to log in.
