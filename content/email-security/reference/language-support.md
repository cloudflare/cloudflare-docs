# Language support

## Email evaluation

The scanning service and verdict engines used by Area 1 are language agnostic. We provide support for Double Byte Character sets (DBCS) and UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encoding.

## Dashboard

The Area 1 email dashboard is localized to several languages. To update your language settings:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. At the bottom of the page, select the language icon.

    <div class="medium-img">
