# Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud

Microsoft 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC) is designed to meet the requirements of the US government. GCC Low and GCC High are two tiers of GCC, each with different security and compliance requirements.

GCC Low is intended for use by US government organizations that handle sensitive but unclassified data, and have less stringent compliance requirements.

Area 1 supports GCC Low environments.
