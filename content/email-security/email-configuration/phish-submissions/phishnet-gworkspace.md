# PhishNet for Google Workspace

PhishNet is an add-in button that helps users to submit directly to Cloud Email Security (formerly Area 1) {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="phishing">}}phish{{</glossary-tooltip>}} samples missed by Area 1’s detection. PhishNet avoids the previous process, where users had to report phish to their email admins, which then had to manually download and forward the sample to Cloud Email Security.

## Prerequisites

To set up PhishNet with Google Workspace you need admin access to your Google Workspace account.

## Set up PhishNet for Google Workspace

1. Log in to [Google Workspace Marketplace apps](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/cloudflare_phishnet/11369379045) using this direct link and an administrator account.

2. Select **Admin install** to install Cloudflare PhishNet. Read the warning, and select **Continue**.

    </div>

3. In the window that opens, choose between installing Cloudflare PhishNet for **Everyone at your organization** or **Certain groups or organizational units**. If you choose this last option, you will also have to select which users you want to install PhishNet to.
