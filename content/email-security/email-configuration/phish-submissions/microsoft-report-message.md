# Microsoft Report Message

Due to changes in the flow of submission messages, Microsoft no longer honors mail flow rules for the Microsoft Report Message button. Therefore, Area 1 is not compatible with this tool anymore.

To learn more about what is happening, log in to your Microsoft account as an administrator, and [review the communication from Microsoft](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC690173).

If you need to submit phish samples or missed phish to Area 1, we recommend  using the [PhishNet for Office 365](/email-security/email-configuration/phish-submissions/phishnet-o365/) integrated app  instead.
