# Link Actions

## Disposition Actions

Create actions for emails with specific [dispositions](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/). `URL defang` means that URLs are no longer links.

To update or create a new disposition action:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. On **Email Configuration**, go to **Email Policies** > **Text Add-Ons**.
4. Select **Edit**.
