# Domains

Cloudflare Area 1 works through a system of domain-based routing, where Cloudflare receives and evaluates incoming email from a domain.

## Create a domain

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Go to **Email Configuration** > **Domains & Routing** > **Domains**.
4. Select **New Domain**.
5. Enter the following information:

    - **Domain**: The domain name receiving email traffic.
    - **Configured As**: Choose **MX Records** or specify a number of **Hops** (depending on your email architecture).
    - **Forwarding To**: Enter the hostname of your email provider.
    - **IP Restrictions** (optional): Restrict incoming traffic to the IP addresses of your mail servers.
    - **Inbound TLS** (only available for non-MX domains): Applies TLS to incoming traffic.
    - **Outbound TLS**: Choose between **Forward all messages over TLS** (recommended) or **Forward all messages using opportunistic TLS**.
    - **Quarantine Policy**: Choose the [dispositions](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/) you want to send to [Admin quarantine](/email-security/email-configuration/admin-quarantine/).
