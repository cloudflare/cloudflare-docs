# Gmail directory integration

Cloudflare Area 1 can integrate with Google to retrieve user and group information. This can be used to enforce the Business Email Compromise configuration to prevent user impersonation.

## 1. Create a service account in Google for Area 1 Directory Integration

You need to authorize Cloudflare Area 1 to make connections into your Google tenant to retrieve your directory details. Cloudflare recommends that you create a service account for this purpose. This account will require the following following privileges:

- View group subscriptions on your domain.
- View organization units on your domain.
- View groups on your domain.
- See info about users on your domain.

Start by creating a service account. If you already have one, you can skip this step.

1. Access your [Google admin console](https://admin.google.com/), and go to **Account** > **Admin roles**.

2. Select **Create new role**, and give it a descriptive name and description. When you are finished, select **Continue**.

3. In **Admin console privileges**, select the following privileges: 
    - _Organizational Units > Read_
    - _Users > Read_
    - _Directory Settings > Settings >Google Support Settings_
    - _Directory Sync > Manage Directory Sync Settings > Read Directory Sync Settings_

    - _Organizational Units > Read_
    - _Users > Read_
    - _Groups > Read_

    Select **Authorize** when you are done.

4. The Area 1 dashboard will redirect you to a Google login page. Select or enter the appropriate account to initiate the authentication process.
