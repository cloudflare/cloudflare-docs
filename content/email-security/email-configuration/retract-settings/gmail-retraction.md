![Email workflow for retracting emails with Google Gmail](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/opening_img-gmail-retraction.png)

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up email retraction for Gmail.

## 1. Configure project and service account in Google Cloud Platform

For Area 1 to be able to retract messages from Gmail inboxes, you first need to create a service account in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.

1. Access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com). From the Dashboard, select **CREATE PROJECT**.

    ![Select Create project to start your new project](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step1-createproject.png)

2. Provide the details for the new project, and select **CREATE** to start your new project.

    ![Fill in the details from your organizations](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step2-create.png)

3. Once the new project has been created, the GCP console will automatically redirect you to the Project console. If not, you can use the **Project selector** to change to the project you created.

    ![If you need, use Project selector to choose the project you created in the previous step](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step3-project.png)

4. In the **Getting Started** card, select **Explore and enable APIs** to access the APIs and services configuration console.

23. Return to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console, and select **Service Accounts** to return to the service account screen.

    ![Select Service accounts](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step23-service-accounts.png)

24. You need to create an API key in the Service account configuration panel. Select the three dots button to open the menu. Then, select **Manage keys**:

    ![Select the three dots menu, and then select Manage Keys](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step24-manage-keys.png)

25. In the Keys configuration panel, select **ADD KEY** > **Create new key**.

    ![Select Add Key and then Create new key](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step25-create-key.png)

26. In **Key type** select **JSON** as the format to create the private key. Then, select **CREATE**.

    ![Select JSON as the key type](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step26-json-key.png)

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Important">}}Save this key in a secure location as it allows access to your cloud resources. You will need to share it with Area 1 as part of the configuration process in the next step.{{</Aside>}}

## 2. Share the service account JSON key with Area 1

You have to upload the private key generated in the previous step to Area 1. This is needed to execute retractions on your Gmail inboxes.

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/), and select **Settings** (the gear icon).

2. Go to **Email Configuration** > **RETRACT SETTINGS** > **Authorize Gmail**.

    ![Go to Authorize Gmail in your Area 1 dashboard](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step2-authorize-gmail.png)

3. Select **New Authorization** and configure the following settings:
    - Select **AUTHORIZATION DATA (JWT)**, and find and upload your JSON private key.
    - Under **Domains**, specify which domain this private key belongs to.
    - Select **Save** to save the configuration.

    ![Select New authorization and configure its settings](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step3-private-key.png)

## 3. Configure auto-retraction actions in Area 1

{{<render file="_auto-retraction.md">}}

## 4. Adjust the hop count in Area 1

Since Area 1 is not configured as the MX record for your domains, you will need to adjust Area 1’s position (hop count) relative to Area 1’s position in the email processing order. 

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/), and select **Settings** (the gear icon).

2. Go to **Email Configuration** > **DOMAINS & ROUTING**.

3. Select the three-dots menu on the domain you want to verify the position, and then select **Edit**.

    ![Go to Domain to verify Area 1's hop position](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step3-hop-position.png)

4. For standalone Gmail only deployments, the value should be set to `2`. If it is not, adjust the **Hops** count to `2`, and select **Update Domain**.

    ![Go to Domain to verify Area 1's hop position](/email-security/static/email-retraction/gmail/step4-hops-count.png)

{{<Aside type="note">}}If you have an existing secure email gateway (SEG) deployed as the MX record, you will need to adjust the hop count accordingly.{{</Aside>}}

## 5. Configure BCC rule in Google Workspaces

You must send copies of inbound email messages to Area 1 for inspection, so that Area 1 can automatically retract messages. Messages can be sent to Area 1 using a BCC compliance rule. Refer to the steps below to learn how to set this up. Automatic retraction is not available when Area 1 is deployed as MX.
