# Retraction guide for Microsoft Office 365

![Email workflow for retracting emails with Microsoft Office 365](/email-security/static/email-retraction/o365/opening_img-o365-retraction.png)

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up email retraction for Microsoft Office 365.

## 1. Authorize Area 1 with Office 365 for retraction

For message retraction to successfully execute, Area 1 needs to be authorized to make API calls into the Office 365 Graph API architecture. The account used to authorize Area 1 requires the **Privileged role admin** role.

When assigning user roles in the Office 365 console, you will find these roles in **User permissions** > **Roles configuration** > **Identity admin roles**.

### How does the authorization work?

The authorization process grants Area 1 access to the Azure environment with the least applicable privileges required to function. The Enterprise Application that Area 1 registers (the Area 1 Security Synchronator) is not tied to any administrator account. Inside of the Azure Active Directory admin center you can review the permissions granted to the application in the Enterprise Application section.

1. Log in to the [Area 1 dashboard](https://horizon.area1security.com/), and select **Settings** (the gear icon).

2. Go to **Email Configuration** > **RETRACT SETTINGS**.

3. You need to authorize Area 1 to execute retractions through the Graph API of Office 365. Make sure that the account that you will be using to authenticate has the appropriate administrative roles assigned. Select **Authorize** to start the process.

4. The Area 1 dashboard will redirect you to a Microsoft login page. Select or enter the appropriate account to initiate the authentication process.

5. Once authenticated, the system will show a dialog box with a list of the requested permissions. Select **Accept** to authorize the change.
