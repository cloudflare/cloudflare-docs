# Phish submissions

As part of your email configuration, your administrators and email recipients can submit missed phish samples to [Area 1 Service Addresses](https://horizon.area1security.com/support/service-addresses) so we can process them and take necessary action.

## What happens after phish submission

After you or your users submit a phish sample, we add that sample directly into our machine learning (ML) queue.

Some samples will be directly converted to `Malicious` upon going through machine learning and the rest will be further processed by our ML module.

## Setup
