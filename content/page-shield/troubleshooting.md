# Troubleshooting

## Why do I not see scripts after I activated Page Shield?

Page Shield doesn't collect data on every single page view. Instead, it uses a sampling approach to gather information efficiently. This means that domains with lower traffic might take longer to generate initial reports, as they need more page views to accumulate enough samples. To speed up the reporting process, it's recommended to actively generate traffic to your application. This will provide Page Shield with more data to work with, leading to faster report generation.

## Why do I see scripts that I do not recognize?

Scripts often reference other scripts outside your application.

But, if you see unexpected scripts on your Script Monitor dashboard, check them for signs of malicious activity.

## Why do I see warnings in my browser's developer tools related to Content Security Policy (CSP)?

Page Shield uses a {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="content security policy (CSP)">}}Content Security Policy (CSP){{</glossary-tooltip>}} report-only directive to gather a list of all scripts running on your application.

Some browsers display scripts being reported as warnings in the console pane of their developer tools. For example:

```txt
[Report Only] Refused to execute inline script because it violates
the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'none'".

Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-RFWPLDbv2BY+rCkDzsE+0fr8ylGr2R2faWMhq4lfEQc='), or a nonce ('nonce-...')
is required to enable inline execution.
```

You can safely ignore these warnings, since they are related to the reports that Page Shield requires to detect loaded scripts. For more information, refer to [How Page Shield works](/page-shield/how-it-works/).
