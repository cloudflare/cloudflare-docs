# Cloudflare Page Shield

Page Shield allows you to take control of the scripts running on your websites.

## Features

Page Shield includes the following features:

* **Monitors**: Displays information about loaded scripts in your domain's pages and the connections they make.
* **Page attribution**: Allows you to find in which page a script first appeared, and view a list of the latest occurrences of the script in your pages.
* **Malicious script detection**: Detects malicious scripts in your pages using threat intelligence and machine learning.
* **Code change detection**: Detects any changes in the scripts loaded in your pages.
* **Alerts**: Receive notifications about newly detected scripts, scripts loaded from unknown domains, new scripts considered malicious, or code changes in your existing scripts.
* **Policies**: Policies define allowed resources on your websites. Start with the log action to validate a policy, and switch to the allow action to start blocking resources not included in the policy.
