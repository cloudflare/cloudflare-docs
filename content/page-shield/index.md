*   **Page attribution**: Allows you to find in which page a script first appeared, and view a list of the latest occurrences of the script in your pages.
*   **Malicious code detection**: Detects malicious code in your pages using threat intelligence and machine learning.
*   **Code change detection**: Detects any changes in the scripts loaded in your pages.
*   **Alerts**: Receive notifications about newly detected scripts, scripts loaded from unknown domains, new scripts considered malicious, or code changes in your existing scripts.
