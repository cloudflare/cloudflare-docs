# Review changed scripts

Page Shield analyzes the JavaScript dependencies in the pages of your domain over time.

You can configure a notification for [code change alerts](/reference/alerts) to receive a daily notification about changed scripts in your domain.

<Aside type="note">

Available as a paid add-on for customers on an Enterprise plan.

When you receive such a notification:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
1. Go to **Firewall** > **Page Shield**.
1. Check the details of each changed script in the Script Monitor dashboard, and validate if it is an expected change.
