# Get started with Cloudflare Page Shield

## Activate Page Shield

To enable Page Shield:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2.  Go to **Security** > **Page Shield**.
3.  Click **Enable Page Shield**.

## Review detected scripts

When you enable Page Shield, it may take a while to get the list of detected scripts in your domain.

Review the scripts displayed in the [**Active Scripts** dashboard](/page-shield/use-dashboard/monitor-scripts/#use-the-active-scripts-dashboard), checking them for signs of malicious activity.
