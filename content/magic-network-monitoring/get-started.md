# Get started

To begin using Magic Network Monitoring, complete the list of tasks below. If you are an Enterprise customer, Cloudflare can significantly accelerate the timeline during active-attack scenarios.

If you are an Enterprise customer and would like to use Magic Network Monitoring and Magic Transit On Demand together, begin by [configuring Magic Transit](/magic-transit/get-started/).

## 1. Verify NetFlow or SFlow capabilities

Verify your routers are capable of exporting NetFlow or sFlow to an IP address on Cloudflareâ€™s network. Magic Network Monitoring supports NetFlow v5, NetFlow v9, IPFIX, and sFlow.

Refer to [Supported routers](/magic-network-monitoring/routers/supported-routers) to view a list of supported routers. The list is not exhaustive.

## 2. Register your router with Cloudflare

When you register your router with Cloudflare, your router links your NetFlow or sFlow data to your Cloudflare account.

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Go to **Analytics & Logs** > **Magic Monitoring**.
3. In **Magic Network Monitoring Analytics**, select **Configure Magic Network Monitoring**.
4. Select the **Configure routers** tab.
5. Under **IP Address**, enter your router's public IP address.
6. Under **Default router sampling rate**, enter a value for the sampling rate. The value should match the sampling rate of your NetFlow or sFlow configuration.
7. Select **Next**.

## 3. Configure your router 

Next, configure your router to send NetFlow/SFlow data to Cloudflare. For this step, you will also need to have your router's configuration menu open to input the values shown in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Refer to the [NetFlow/IPFIX configuration](/magic-network-monitoring/routers/netflow-ipfix-config/) or the [sFlow configuration guide](/magic-network-monitoring/routers/sflow-jflow-config/) for more information.

1. From **Configure routers** in the dashboard, select either **NetFlow Configuration** or **sFlow configuration**.
2. Follow the configuration steps for the selected configuration type. 
3. Enter the values shown in your router's configuration.
4. Select **Next**.

## 4. Check your router configuration

After setting up your router, confirm the configuration was successfully set up. 

From the **Check routers** page on the dashboard, you can view the status of your routers. Keep in mind that router data takes five to ten minutes to be sent to Cloudflare. 

Refer to **Router status description** to confirm whether data is successfully being sent.

When you are done with router configuration, select **Finish onboarding**.

## 5. Create rules

Create rules to analyze data for a specific set of destinations or to implement thresholds. Refer to [Rules](/magic-network-monitoring/rules/) for more information.
