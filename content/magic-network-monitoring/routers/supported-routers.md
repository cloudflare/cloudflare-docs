# Supported routers

The majority of enterprise-grade routers are capable of exporting NetFlow or sFlow, and popular router brands that support either NetFlow or sFlow are listed below.

Relatively few consumer grade routers are capable of exporting NetFlow or sFlow. If you are a network hobbyist, business, or other organization, and your router options are limited, you can view the list of open source and affordable options below.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note:">}}

These lists are not exhaustive, and we encourage you to check your routerâ€™s specification sheet to confirm your router is capable of exporting NetFlow or sFlow.
