# DDoS reports

To download an ad-hoc DDoS report, generate a PDF report file by clicking **Print report** in your [analytics dashboard](/ddos-protection/reference/analytics/).

Additionally, if you are a Magic Transit customer, you will receive [weekly DDoS reports](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360053233231) by email. These reports include the DDoS activity summary, insights, and trends over time.
