# DDoS alerts

Configure notifications to receive real-time alerts (within ~1 minute) about L3/4 and L7 DDoS attacks on your Internet properties, depending on your plan and services. You can choose from different delivery methods.

Each notification email includes the following information:

* Description
* Detection and mitigation time of attack
* Attack type
* Maximum rate of attack
* Attack target
* Rule that matched the attack (ID and description)
* Rule override, if any

Notifications for HTTP DDoS alerts delivered through webhook or PagerDuty will also include the target hostname.

You will not receive duplicate DDoS alerts within the same one-hour time frame.

Cloudflare automatically sends weekly summaries of detected and mitigated DDoS attacks to Magic Transit and Spectrum BYOIP customers. For more information, refer to [DDoS reports](/ddos-protection/reference/reports/).

## Alert types

Cloudflare can issue notifications for different types of DDoS attack alerts.

### Standard alerts

* **HTTP DDoS Attack Alert**: Alert for HTTP attacks that generate more than 100 requests per second.
* **Layer 3/4 DDoS Attack Alert**: Alert for Layer 3/4 attacks that generate more than 20,000 packets per second.

### Advanced alerts

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The availability of advanced DDoS attack alerts depends on your Cloudflare plan and subscribed services. Refer to [Availability](#availability) for details.
{{</Aside>}}

Advanced DDoS attack alerts support additional configuration, allowing you to filter the notifications you wish to receive.

* **Advanced HTTP DDoS Attack Alert**: Customizable alert for HTTP attacks that generate more than the configured number of requests per second (100 rps by default). Supports the following configuration parameters:

    * The zones in your account for which you wish to receive notifications.
    * The specific hostnames for which you wish to receive notifications.
    * The minimum requests-per-second rate that will trigger the alert (100 rps by default).

* **Advanced Layer 3/4 DDoS Attack Alert**: Customizable alert for Layer 3/4 attacks that generate more than the configured number of packets per second (12,000 pps by default). Supports the following configuration parameters:

    * The IP prefixes for which you wish to receive notifications.
    * The specific IP addresses for which you wish to receive notifications.
    * The minimum packets-per-second rate that will trigger the alert (12,000 pps by default).
    * The minimum megabits-per-second rate that will trigger the alert.
    * The protocols for which you wish to receive notifications (all protocols by default).

You will also receive alerts for rules with a _Log_ action, containing information on what triggered the alert.

## Availability

The available alerts depend on your Cloudflare plan and subscribed services:

To investigate a possibly ongoing attack, select **View Dashboard**. To go to the rule details in the Cloudflare dashboard, select **View Rule**.

## Final remarks

* DDoS alerts are currently only available for DDoS attacks detected and mitigated by the [DDoS managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/). Alerts are not yet available for DDoS attacks detected and mitigated by the [Advanced TCP Protection](/ddos-protection/tcp-protection/) system.

* If you configure more than one alert type for the same kind of attack (for example, both an HTTP DDoS Attack Alert and an Advanced HTTP DDoS Attack Alert) you may get more than one notification when an attack occurs. To avoid receiving duplicate notifications, delete one of the configured alerts.

* Events listed under [Security Events](/waf/security-events/paid-plans/) with the `Connection Close` mitigation action are not covered by DDoS alerts. Cloudflare only sends notifications when the mitigation action is one of the following: `force-conn-close`, `block`, `ratelimit`, or `captcha`.
