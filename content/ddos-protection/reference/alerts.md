# DDoS alerts

Configure notifications to receive real-time alerts (within ~1 minute) about L3/4 and L7 DDoS attacks on your Internet properties, depending on your plan and services. You can choose from different delivery methods.

Each notification email includes the following information:

* Description
* Detection and mitigation time of attack
* Attack type
* Maximum rate of attack
* Attack target

Notifications for HTTP DDoS alerts delivered through webhook or PagerDuty will also include the target hostname.

Cloudflare automatically sends weekly summaries of detected and mitigated DDoS attacks to Magic Transit and Spectrum BYOIP customers. For more information, refer to [DDoS reports](/ddos-protection/reference/reports/).

## Alert types

Cloudflare can issue notifications for two kinds of DDoS alerts:

* **HTTP DDoS attack**: For HTTP attacks with a duration over 2 minutes that generate more than 2,000 requests per second.
* **L3/L4 (network/transport layer) DDoS attack**: For Layer 3/4 attacks with a duration over 2 minutes that generate more than 20,000 packets per second.

The available notifications depend on your Cloudflare plan and services:

Notification type     | WAF/CDN | Spectrum | Spectrum BYOIP | Magic Transit
----------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:--------------:|:------------:
HTTP DDoS attack      | Yes     | –        | –              | –
Layer 3/4 DDoS attack | –       | Yes\*    | Yes            | Yes

\* Only available on an Enterprise plan.

To investigate a possibly ongoing attack, click **View Dashboard**.

## Final remarks

Events listed under Firewall Events with the `Connection Close` mitigation action are not covered by DDoS alerts. Cloudflare only sends notifications when the mitigation action is one of the following: `force-conn-close`, `block`, `ratelimit`, or `captcha`.
