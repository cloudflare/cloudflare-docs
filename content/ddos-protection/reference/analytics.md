# DDoS analytics

You can view DDoS analytics in different dashboards, depending on your service and plan:

- The [Firewall Analytics dashboard](/waf/analytics/) provides you with visibility into L7 firewall events that target your zone, including HTTP DDoS attacks and TCP attacks.

- The [Network Analytics dashboard](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360038696631) provides you with visibility into L3/4 traffic and DDoS attacks that target your IP ranges or Spectrum applications.
