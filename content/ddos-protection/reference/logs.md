# DDoS logs

Retrieve HTTP events using [Cloudflare Logs](/logs/) to integrate them into your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

Additionally, if you are a Magic Transit or a Spectrum customer on an Enterprise plan, you can export L3/4 traffic and DDoS attack logs using the [Network Analytics logs](/logs/reference/log-fields/account/network_analytics_logs/). You can also export logs using the GraphQL API â€” for more information, refer to the [Export GraphQL data to CSV](/analytics/graphql-api/tutorials/export-graphql-to-csv/) tutorial.
