# DDoS logs

Retrieve HTTP events using [Cloudflare Logs](/logs/) to integrate them into your {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="SIEM">}}SIEM systems{{</glossary-tooltip>}}.

Additionally, if you are a Magic Transit or a Spectrum customer on an Enterprise plan, you can export L3/4 traffic and DDoS attack logs using the [Network Analytics logs](/logs/reference/log-fields/account/network_analytics_logs/). You can also export logs using the GraphQL API — for more information, refer to the [Export GraphQL data to CSV](/analytics/graphql-api/tutorials/export-graphql-to-csv/) tutorial.
