# Cloudflare DDoS Protection

Cloudflare automatically detects and mitigates [Distributed Denial of Service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) (DDoS) attacks using its Autonomous Edge.

The Autonomous Edge includes multiple dynamic mitigation rules exposed as [Cloudflare DDoS Attack Protection managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/). You can customize the mitigation rules included in these rulesets to optimize and tailor the protection to your needs.
