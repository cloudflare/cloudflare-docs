# About Cloudflare DDoS protection

Cloudflare provides unmetered and unlimited {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack" link="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">}}distributed denial-of-service (DDoS){{</glossary-tooltip>}} protection at layers 3, 4, and 7 to all customers on all plans and services.

The protection is enabled by Cloudflareâ€™s [Autonomous DDoS Protection Edge](/ddos-protection/about/components/#autonomous-edge), which automatically detects and mitigates DDoS attacks.

The Autonomous Edge includes multiple dynamic mitigation rules exposed as [managed rulesets](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/), which provide comprehensive protection against a variety of DDoS attacks across layers 3/4 and layer 7 of the OSI model.
