# 2023-04-17

Previously, only a subset of rules were exposed publicly, these rules were the rule that were known to cause false positives in some rare situations. Other rules that are stronger and are not known to cause any issue were not published.

We now publish all rules, so packets matching these rules will display the correct rule identifier. The newly published rules are read-only and cannot be disabled.
