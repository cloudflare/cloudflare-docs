## Create a waiting room via the API

{{<Aside>}}For additional context on creating a waiting room, refer to [Get started](/waiting-room/get-started/).{{</Aside>}}

Create a waiting room by appending the following endpoint in the [Waiting Room API](/api/operations/waiting-room-create-waiting-room) to the Cloudflare API base URL.

```txt
POST zones/{zone_identifier}/waiting_rooms
```

The Cloudflare API base URL is:

```txt
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4
```

For authentication instructions, refer to [Getting Started: Requests](/fundamentals/api/) in the Cloudflare API documentation.

For help with endpoints and pagination, refer to [Getting Started: Endpoints](/fundamentals/api/).

Configure your waiting room with the following required parameters in the `data` field:

*  `name` - A unique name for the waiting room. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
*  `host` - Host name for which you want to configure a waiting room.
*  `total_active_users` - The total number of active user sessions on the route at a point in time.
*  `new_users_per_minute` - The number of new users gaining entry into the route every minute.

The following parameters are optional:

*  `path` - The path within the host for which you want to configure a waiting room. The waiting room will be enabled for all subpaths as well.
*  `description` - A description of the waiting room.
*  `session_duration` - Lifetime of a cookie (in minutes) set by Cloudflare for users who get access to the route.
*  `custom_page_html` - HTML code to customize the appearance of your waiting room. Cloudflare provides a sample HTML template that enables the display of estimated wait time on the waiting room page. The default waiting room is used if `custom_page_html` is not specified. Refer to [Waiting Room API properties](/api/operations/waiting-room-list-waiting-rooms).
*  `json_response_enabled` - If you are using this waiting room to manage traffic for your mobile app or API, make sure you have set up a [JSON friendly response](/waiting-room/how-to/json-response/) and set `json_response_enabled` to `true`.

## Example

The following example API request configures a waiting room.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone-id}/waiting_rooms" \
-H "X-Auth-Email: user@example.com" \
-H "X-Auth-Key: xxxxxxxx" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
  "name": "shop_waiting_room",
  "description": "Waiting room for webshop",
  "host": "shop.example.com",
  "path": "/shop",
  "queue_all": true,
  "new_users_per_minute": 200,

  "queueing_method": "FIFO",
