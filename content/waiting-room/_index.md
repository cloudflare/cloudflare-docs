# Cloudflare Waiting Room

Cloudflare Waiting Room protects websites by queueing site visitors when a website experiences unmanageable surges in legitimate traffic that may otherwise bring an application down.

{{<render file="_non-contract-enablement.md" productFolder="fundamentals" >}}

## Benefits

Waiting Room protects **your origin server** by preventing surges in legitimate traffic that may overload your origin.

Waiting Room also benefits **your visitors** by:

- Keeping your application online and preventing them from reaching error pages.
- Showing estimated wait times that are continuously updated.
- Opening up new spots more quickly by tracking dynamic inflow and [outflow](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/#session-duration).
- Remembering each visitor's status to prevent someone from losing their place in line or having to re-queue if they leave your site.
- Appearing in your own [branding and style](/waiting-room/how-to/customize-waiting-room/), which enhances trust and lets you provide additional information as needed.

## How it works

Once you have [created and activated a waiting room](/waiting-room/get-started/) for a specific application page:

- If a page is not experiencing heavy traffic, a visitor accesses the page directly.
- If page traffic crosses a [user-defined threshold](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/#session-duration), a visitor enters a virtual waiting room until it is their turn to access the page:
  - Each user receives a [cookie](/waiting-room/reference/waiting-room-cookie/) to manage the dynamic outflow of requests from the waiting room to the origin website in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
  - While in the waiting room, the user's browser automatically refreshes every 20 seconds to give them updated information about their estimated wait time.
  - When a user exits the waiting room and reaches your application, they can leave and re-enter without waiting for the length of time specified by the [session duration](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/#session-duration).
  - Because waiting rooms support dynamic inflow and [outflow](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/#session-duration), new spots appear more quickly and estimated wait times are lower and more accurate.
