To queue visitors only when necessary:

1.  Go to **Traffic** > **Waiting Room**.
2.  On a waiting room, set **Enabled** to **On**.
3.  Your waiting room will begin queueing visitors once it approaches the target traffic thresholds defined in [**Total active users**](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/) and in [**New users per minute**](/waiting-room/reference/configuration-settings/).
