To queue visitors only when necessary:

1.  Go to **Traffic** > **Waiting Rooms**.
2.  On a waiting room, set **Enabled** to **On**.
3.  Your waiting room will begin queueing visitors once it reaches the traffic thresholds defined in [**Total active users**](/reference/configuration-settings) and [**New users per minute**](/reference/configuration-settings).
