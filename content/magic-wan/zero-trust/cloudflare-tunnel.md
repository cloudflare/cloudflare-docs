# Cloudflare Tunnel

Magic WAN can be used together with [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) for easy access between your networks and applications.

By default, TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic routed through Magic WAN tunnels and destined to routes behind Cloudflare Tunnel will be proxied/filtered through [Cloudflare Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/).

If you have overlapping routes in your Magic WAN and Cloudflare Tunnel routing configurations, Cloudflare Tunnel routes will take precedence. This is true regardless of the [health status of your tunnels](/magic-wan/reference/tunnel-health-checks/#health-state-and-prioritization).

However, if you have overlapping routes in your Magic WAN and Cloudflare Tunnel routing configurations in the default [Tunnel virtual network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/), outbound connections from within that network will not work. This happens because Cloudflare Tunnel does not support outbound connections.

## Test `cloudflared` tunnel integration

To check if a `cloudflared` tunnel is working properly with your Magic WAN connection, open a browser from a host behind your customer premise equipment, and browse to the `cloudflared` tunnel endpoint. 

For example, imagine you have a Cloudflare Tunnel set up with a private network CIDR of `10.1.2.3/32`, a static route defined in Magic WAN for `10.1.2./24`, and the device you are trying to connect to is a web server. You can test connectivity to the web server by using a browser to load `https://10.1.2.3`. If the page loads correctly, your Cloudflare Tunnel is working properly. In this scenario, you have overlapping routes defined for Cloudflare Tunnel and Magic WAN.

As mentioned above, if you have overlapping routes in your Magic WAN and Cloudflare Tunnel routing configurations, Cloudflare Tunnel will take precedence. This happens whenever a `cloudflared` tunnel CIDR matches a packet, regardless of prefix length. For example, a `cloudflared` tunnel with prefix `10.1.2.0/24` will take precedence over a static route configured to `10.1.2.4/32`, sending packets over a GRE tunnel.
