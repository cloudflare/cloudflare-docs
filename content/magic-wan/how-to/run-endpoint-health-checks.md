# Run endpoint health checks

Magic WAN uses endpoint health checks to determine the overall health of your inter-network connections. Probes originate from Cloudflare infrastructure (outside customer network namespaces) and target IP addresses deep within your network. This process occurs beyond the tunnel-terminating border router, and these “long distance” probes are purely diagnostic.

| Prefix          | Endpoint IP address |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| 103.21.244.0/24 | 103.21.244.100      |
| 103.21.245.0/24 | 103.21.245.100      |
