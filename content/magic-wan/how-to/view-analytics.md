# View Network Analytics

Cloudflareâ€™s Network Analytics provides near real-time visibility into network and transport layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks which can help troubleshoot IP traffic issues. You can also use Network Analytics to view information about the traffic that leaves Cloudflare's global network by reviewing ingress and egress tunnel traffic over a specific amount of time.
