## Application-aware policies

By default, Cloudflare balances and steers traffic based on network-layer characteristics (IP, port etc). If you are using the Magic WAN Connector, you can also steer traffic based on well-known applications. Application-aware policies provide easier management and more granularity over traffic flows.
