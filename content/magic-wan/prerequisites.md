# Prerequisites

Before you can begin using Magic WAN, verify that you meet Cloudflare's onboarding requirements.

## Use Magic WAN Connector or compatible tunnel endpoint routers

Magic WAN relies [on GRE](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/) and [IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#ipsec-tunnels) to transmit packets from Cloudflareâ€™s global network to your origin network.

To ensure compatibility with Magic WAN, the routers at your tunnel endpoints must:

- Allow configuration of at least one tunnel per Internet service provider (ISP).
- Support maximum segment size (MSS) clamping.
- Support the configuration parameters for IPsec mentioned in [GRE and IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters).

You can also use [Magic WAN Connector](/magic-wan/connector/) to make it easier to onboard your network locations to Cloudflare.
