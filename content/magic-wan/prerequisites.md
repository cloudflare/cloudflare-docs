# Prerequisites

Before you can begin using Magic WAN, verify that you meet Cloudflare's onboarding requirements.

## Use compatible tunnel endpoint routers

Magic WAN relies on GRE and IPsec tunnels to transmit packets from Cloudflareâ€™s global network to your origin network. To ensure compatibility with Magic WAN, the routers at your tunnel endpoints must:

- Allow configuration of at least one tunnel per Internet service provider (ISP).
- Support maximum segment size (MSS) clamping.
