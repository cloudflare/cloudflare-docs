# Magic WAN on-ramps

To on-ramp your network traffic to Magic WAN, you can use [Magic WAN Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/), a lightweight software package you can install in corporate network locations to automatically connect, steer, and shape any IP traffic.

You can also use any device that supports [GRE or IPsec](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/) tunnels with the supported configuration parameters.

Additional compatible on-ramps include:
- [Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI)](/magic-wan/network-interconnect/): Connect your network infrastructure directly with Cloudflare – rather than using the public Internet – for a more reliable and secure experience.
- [Cloudflare Tunnel](/magic-wan/zero-trust/cloudflare-tunnel/#cloudflare-tunnel): Magic WAN can be used together with Cloudflare Tunnel for easy access between your networks and applications.
- [WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/): Protect corporate devices by securely and privately sending traffic from those devices to Cloudflare’s global network, where Cloudflare Gateway can apply advanced web filtering.
- [Magic Cloud Networking](/magic-wan/configuration/magic-cloud-networking/): Automatically create on-ramps from your cloud networks to Magic WAN.
- [Network on-ramp partnerships](https://www.cloudflare.com/network-onramp-partners/): Refer to our [third-party integration tutorials](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/third-party/) for guidance on configuring the most asked for third-party products.
