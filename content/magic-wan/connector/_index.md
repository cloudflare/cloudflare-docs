The Magic WAN Connector (beta) is a lightweight software package you can install in corporate network locations to automatically connect, steer, and shape any IP traffic.

You can purchase Magic WAN Connector software pre-installed on a Cloudflare-certified device, which is the easiest way to onboard your network locations to Cloudflare One. It ensures the best possible connectivity to the closest Cloudflare network location, where we will apply security controls and send traffic on an optimized route to its destination.
