# Get started

Before you can begin using Magic WAN, be sure to complete the onboarding steps below.

## 1. Scope your configuration

The onboarding process begins with an initial kickoff call where Cloudflare engages with your organization to confirm the scope and timeline for setting up Magic WAN.

After your call with Cloudflare, complete the [prerequisites](/magic-wan/prerequisites/).

## 2. Configure tunnels

[Configure your tunnels](/magic-wan/how-to/configure-tunnels/) to connect Cloudflare to your origin infrastructure.

## 3. Configure static routes

[Configure your static routes](/magic-wan/how-to/configure-static-routes/) to route your traffic through your tunnels.

## 4. Run endpoint health checks

[Specify the endpoint IP addresses](/magic-wan/how-to/run-endpoint-health-checks/) to use for endpoint health checks that monitor the overall health of your connections.

## 5. Go live

After setting Magic WAN, we also recommend you [review your Firewall configuration](/magic-firewall/) at this time.
