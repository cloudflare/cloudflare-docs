# Get started

There are two ways to set up Magic WAN:
- Automatically, through Magic WAN Connector (preferred).
- Manually, through a third-party device.

## Set up through Magic WAN Connector (preferred)

Refer to [Configure with Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/) for more information.

## Set up manually through a third-party device

Refer to [Prerequisites](/magic-wan/prerequisites/) before following the steps in [Manual configuration](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/).
