# pfSense firewall

This tutorial includes the steps required to configure IPsec tunnels to connect a pfSense firewall to Cloudflare Magic WAN.

## Software tested

Manufacturer | Firmware revision
---          | ---
pfSense      | 24.03

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you will need to know the following information:
- Your Anycast IP addresses (given to you by Cloudflare)
- External IP addresses
- Internal IP address ranges
- Inside tunnel `/31` ranges

## Example scenario

The following IP addresses are used throughout this tutorial. Any legally routable IP addresses have been replaced with IPv4 Address Blocks Reserved for Documentation ([RFC 5737](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5737)) addresses within the `203.0.113.0/24` subnet.

Tunnel name                        | `PF_TUNNEL_01`                | `PF_TUNNEL_02`
---                                | ---                           | ---
Interface address                  | `10.252.2.26/31`              | `10.252.2.28/31`
Customer endpoint                  | `203.0.113.254`               | `203.0.113.254`
Cloudflare endpoint                | `<YOUR_ANYCAST_IP_ADDRESS_1>` | `<YOUR_ANYCAST_IP_ADDRESS_2>`
Pfsense IPsec Phase 2 Local IP     | `10.252.2.27`                 | `10.252.2.29`
Pfsense IPsec Phase 2 Remote IP    | `10.252.2.26`                 | `10.252.2.28`
Magic WAN static routes — Prefix   | `10.1.100.0/24`               | `10.1.100.0/24`
Magic WAN static routes — Next hop | `PF_TUNNEL_01`                | `PF_TUNNEL_02`

## 1. Configure Magic WAN IPsec tunnels

Use the Cloudflare dashboard or API to [configure two IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/#add-tunnels). The settings mentioned below are used for the IPsec tunnels referenced throughout the remainder of this guide.

### Add IPsec tunnels

1. Follow the [Add tunnels](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/#add-tunnels) instructions to create the required IPsec tunnels with the following options:
    - **Tunnel name**: `PF_TUNNEL_01`
    - **Interface address**: `10.252.2.26/31`
    - **Customer endpoint**: `203.0.113.254`
    - **Cloudflare endpoint**: Enter the Anycast IP address provided by Cloudflare.
    - **Health check rate**: _Medium_
    - **Health check type**: _Request_
    - **Health check direction**: _Bidirectional_
2. Select **Add pre-shared key later** > **Add tunnels**.
3. Repeat the process to create a second IPsec tunnel with the following options:
    - **Tunnel name**: `PF_TUNNEL_02`
    - **Interface address**: `10.252.2.28/31`
    - **Customer endpoint**: `203.0.113.254`
    - **Cloudflare endpoint**: Enter the Anycast IP address provided by Cloudflare.
    - **Health check rate**: _Medium_
    - **Health check type**: _Request_
    - **Health check direction**: _Bidirectional_
4. Select **Add pre-shared key later** > **Add tunnels**.

### Generate pre-shared keys

When you create IPsec tunnels with the option **Add pre-shared key later**, the Cloudflare dashboard will show you a warning indicator.

1. Select **Edit** to edit the properties of each IPsec tunnel you have created.
2. Select **Generate a new pre-shared key** > **Update and generate pre-shared key**.
3. Copy the pre-shared key value for each of your IPsec tunnels, and save these values somewhere safe. Then, select **Done**.

{{<Aside type="note">}} Take note of your pre-shared keys, and keep them in a safe place to use later in pfSense.{{</Aside>}}

### IPsec identifier - User ID

After creating your IPsec tunnels, the Cloudflare dashboard will list them under **Tunnels**. To retrieve your IPsec tunnel's user ID:

1. Go to **Magic WAN** > **Configuration**.
2. Select **Tunnels**.
3. Select the IPsec tunnel.
4. Scroll to **User ID** and copy the string. For example, `ipsec@long_string_of_letters_and_numbers`.

The User ID will be required when configuring IKE Phase 1 on the pfSense firewall.

## 2. Create Magic WAN static routes

Create a [static route](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-static-routes/#create-a-static-route) for each of the two IPsec tunnels configured in the previous section, with the following settings (settings not mentioned here can be left with their default values):

### Tunnel 01

- **Description**: `PF_TUNNEL_01`
- **Prefix**: `10.1.100.0/24`
- **Tunnel/Next hop**: `PF_TUNNEL_01`

### Tunnel 02

- **Description**: `PF_TUNNEL_02`
- **Prefix**: `10.1.100.0/24`
- **Tunnel/Next hop**: `PF_TUNNEL_02`

## 3. Configure the pfSense firewall

Install pfSense and boot up. Then, assign and set LAN and WAN interfaces, as well as IP addresses. For example:
- **LAN**: `203.0.113.254`
- **WAN**: `<YOUR_WAN_ADDRESS>`

### Configure IPsec Phase 1

Add a new IPsec tunnel [Phase 1 entry](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/vpn/ipsec/configure-p1.html), with the following settings:

- **General Information**
    - **Description**: `CF1_IPsec_P1`
- **IKE Endpoint Configuration**
    - **Key exchange version**: _IKE_v2_
    - **Internet Protocol**: _IPv4_
    - **Interface**: _WAN_
    - **Remote gateway**: Enter your Cloudflare Anycast IP address.
- **Phase 1 Proposal (Authentication)**
    - **Authentication method**: _Mutual PSK_
    - **My identifier**: _User Fully qualified domain name_ > `ipsec@long_string_of_letters_and_numbers` <br> (You can get this identifier from your Cloudflare IPsec tunnel configuration > **User ID**)
    - **Peer identifier**: _Peer IP Address_ (your Cloudflare Anycast IP)
    - **Pre-Shared Key**: Enter the PSK you have on your Cloudflare IPsec tunnel.
- **Phase 1 proposal (Encryption algorithm)**
    - **Encryption algorithm**: _AES 256 bits_
    - **Key length**: _256 bits_
    - **Hash algorithm**: _SHA256_
    - **DH key group**: _14_
    - **Lifetime**: `28800`

### Configure IPsec Phase 2

Add a new IPsec tunnel [Phase 2 entry](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/vpn/ipsec/configure-p2.html), with the following settings. You need to create an entry for tunnel 1 and 2, making the appropriate changes for the IP addresses for local and remote network:

- **General Information**
    - **Description**: `CF1_IPsec_P2`
    - **Mode**: _Routed (VTI)_
- **Networks**
    - **Local Network**: _Address_ > Upper IP address in the `/31` assigned in Cloudflare tunnel. For example, `10.252.2.27` for tunnel 1 and `10.252.2.29` for tunnel 2.
    - **Remote Network**: _Address_ > Lower IP address in the `/31` for Cloudflare side. For example, `10.252.2.26` for tunnel 1, and `10.252.2.28` for tunnel 2.
- **Phase 2 Proposal (SA/Key Exchange)**
    - **Protocol**: _ESP_
    - **Encryption algorithm**: _AES 256 bits_
    - **Hash algorithm**: _SHA256_
    - **DH key group**: _14_
    - **Lifetime**: `3600`

When you are finished, apply your changes. If you go to **Status** > **IPsec**, you should be able to check that both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are connected.

### Interface assignments

In **Interfaces** > **Assignments** > **Add**, create a new interface to assign to the first IPsec tunnel, with the following settings:

- **General configuration**
    - **Description**: `CF1_IPsec_1`
    - **MSS**: `1446`
- **Interface Assignments**
    - **WAN**: Add your WAN interface. For example, `vnet1`.
    - **LAN**: Add your LAN interface. For example, `vnet0`.
    - Add your **CF_IPsec_1** that you have created above for Phase 1.

Select **Save** when you are finished.
