# Enable NAT for a subnet

Each subnet (directly-attached or routed) must have a unique address space within your Magic WAN. You can re-use address spaces locally by enabling static network address translation (NAT) for a subnet. Subnet NAT is 1:1. To enable it, supply an address prefix the same size as the subnet's prefix, and the Magic WAN Connector will translate between the two.

For example:
- **Prefix**: `192.168.100.0/24`
- **Static NAT prefix**: `10.10.100.0/24`

With the example above, outbound traffic from host `192.168.100.13` in the subnet is translated to `10.10.100.13` in the Connector (and vice versa for incoming traffic).

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Even if NAT is enabled, the local prefix for a subnet must be unique within its LAN. It can, however, be reused on other LANs or other sites. Overlay-facing prefixes — that is, a subnet's NAT prefix if NAT is enabled, and its local prefix otherwise — must always be unique across your whole Magic WAN.

## Create NATs for subnets

For more information on how to a create a NAT for a subnets, refer to **Create a LAN**, either in [Configure hardware Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/configure-hardware-connector/#3-create-a-lan) or [Configure virtual Connector](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/configure-virtual-connector/#3-create-a-lan).
