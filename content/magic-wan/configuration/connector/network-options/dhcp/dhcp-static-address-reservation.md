# DHCP static address reservation

If you configure your Connector to be a DHCP server, you can also assign IP addresses to specific devices on your network. To reserve IP addresses:

1. Configure your Connector to be a [DHCP server](/magic-wan/configuration/connector/network-options/dhcp/dhcp-server/).
2. Select **Add DHCP Reservation**.
3. In **Hardware Address** enter the [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) for the device you want a specific IP address for.
4. In **IP Address**, enter the IP address for that device.
5. (Optional) If you need to reserve more IP addresses, select **Add DHCP Reservation** as many times as needed, and enter the new values.
