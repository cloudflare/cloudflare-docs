Magic WAN is an Enterprise-only product. You need to [contact Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-wan/) to acquire Magic WAN. Magic WAN Connector also depends on you having Magic WAN. You can purchase Magic WAN Connector software pre-installed on a Cloudflare-certified device. Contact your account representative to learn more about purchasing options for the Magic WAN Connector device.
