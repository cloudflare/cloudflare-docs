# Cisco Viptela SD-WAN

Cloudflare partners with Cisco's 8000k router SD-WAN solution to provide users with an integrated solution. The Viptela appliances (physical and virtual) manage subnets associated with branch offices and cloud instances. Anycast Tunnels – GRE and IPsec – are set up between these appliances and Cloudflare to securely route Internet-bound traffic. This tutorial describes how to configure the Cisco 8000k router in the SD-WAN mode for north-south (Internet-bound) use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up a connection between Cisco Viptela and Cloudflare, you must have:

- Purchased Magic WAN and Secure Web Gateway.
- Cloudflare provision Magic WAN and Secure Web Gateway.
- Received two Cloudflare tunnel endpoints (Anycast IP address) assigned to Magic WAN.
- Cisco 800k0k SD-WAN appliances (physical or virtual). This ensures specific Internet-bound traffic from the sites' private networks is routed over the Anycast GRE tunnels to Secure Web Gateway to enforce a user's specific web access policies.
- A static IP pair to use with the tunnel endpoints. The static IPs should be /31 addresses separate from the IPs used in the subnet deployment. The software version used on Cisco was `20.6.2/17.6.2`.

## Example scenario

For the purpose of this tutorial, the integration will refer to a scenario with one branch office with subnets.

For this example scenario, a non-default template for `SIG-Branch` was created.

![Traffic flow diagram for GRE](/magic-wan/static/viptela-flow-diagram-gre.png)

To create a Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) using vManage:

1. From **Cisco vManage** under **Configuration**, click **Generic** and **Add Tunnel**.
2. Refer to the table below for the setting fields and their options.

|     Setting             |   Type/Detail                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Global Template**     | Factory_Default_Global_CISCO_Template  |
| **Cisco Banner**        | Factory_Default_Retail_Banner          |
| **Policy**              | Branch-Local-Policy                    |

**Transport & Management VPN settings**

|     Setting                        |   Type/Detail                   |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Cisco VPN 0**                    | GCP-Branch-VPN0                 |
| **Cisco Secure Internet Gateway**  | Branch-SIG-GRE-Template         |
| **Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet**   | GCP-Branch-Public-Internet-TLOC |
| **Cisco VPN Interface Ethernet**   | GCP-VPN0-Interface              |
| **Cisco VPN 512**                  | Default_AWS_TGW_CSR_VPN512_V01  |

**Basic Information settings**

|     Setting        |   Type/Detail                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Cisco System**   | Default_BootStrap_Cisco_System_Template |
| **Cisco Loging**   | Default_Logging_Cisco_V01               |
| **Cisco AAA**      | AWS-Branch-AAA-Template                 |
| **Cisco BFD**      | Default_BFD_Cisco-V01                   |

For this example scenario, a non-default template for SIG-Branch-IPsec-Template was created.

![Traffic flow diagram for IPsec](/magic-wan/static/viptela-flow-diagram-ipsec.png)

To create a Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) using vManage:

1. From **Cisco vManage** under **Configuration**, click **Generic** and **Add Tunnel**.
2. Refer to the table below for the setting fields and their options.

|     Setting                                       |   Type/Detail                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Tunnel Type**                                   | IPsec                             |

| **Perfect Forward Secrecy**                       | Global (Group-14 2048-bit modulus) |
</div>
</details>

## 2. (IPsec only) Create a non-default feature template 

For compatibility, you will need to disable replay protection, which is not an option through the templates, by creating a CLI template in addition to the feature template created in the previous step.

![CLI configuration used to disable replay](/magic-wan/static/viptela-cli-config.png)

In the image above, replay is disabled and the `local key-id` is set to a variable so that a Cloudflare tunnel ID with the format `xxxxxx_YYYYYYY` can be added.

## 3. Create tunnels in vManage

<details>
<summary>

</summary>
 <div class="special-class" markdown="1">

From vManage, click **Configuration** > **Templates**. You should see the newly created template where you will update the device values. 

Because the template was created to add GRE tunnels, you only need to update the device values. Note that **VPN0** is the default, and the WAN interface used to build the tunnel must be part of **VPN0**.

 <div class="special-class" markdown="1">

From **vManage**, click **Configuration** > **Templates**. You should see the newly created template where you will update the device values. 

In the example below, the template is the **GCP-Branch-Template**. Note that **VPN0** is the default, and the WAN interface used to build the tunnel needs to be part of VPN0.

</summary>
 <div class="special-class" markdown="1">

For additional information on creating IPsec tunnels, refer to [API documentation for IPsec tunnels](https://api.cloudflare.com/#magic-ipsec-tunnels-create-ipsec-tunnels).

- `X-Auth-Email`: Your Cloudflare email ID
- `X-Auth-Key`: Seen in the URL (dash.cloudflare.com/<X-Auth-Key>/....)
- `Account key`: Global API token in Cloudflare dashboard

1. Test new IPsec tunnel creation

```bash
---
header: Request
---
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/magic/ipsec_tunnels?validate_only=true" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: user@example.com" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: XXXXXXXXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"ipsec_tunnels":[{"name":"IPSec_cisco","customer_endpoint":"35.239.85.133","cloudflare_endpoint":"172.64.241.205","interface_address":"10.49.0.11/31","description":"Tunnel for Cisco 8000v"}]}'
```

2. Create new IPSec tunnel

```bash
---
header: Request
---
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/magic/ipsec_tunnels?validate_only=true" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: user@example.com" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: XXXXXXXXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"ipsec_tunnels":[{"name":"IPSec_cisco","customer_endpoint":"35.239.85.133","cloudflare_endpoint":"172.64.241.205","interface_address":"10.49.0.11/31","description":"Tunnel for Cisco 8000v"}]}'
```

```bash
---
header: Response
---
{
"result": {
"ipsec_tunnels": [
{
"id": "XXXXXXXXXX",
"interface_address": "10.49.0.11/31",
"created_on": "2022-05-03T23:03:19.104194Z",
"modified_on": "2022-05-03T23:03:19.104194Z",
"name": "IPsec_cisco",
"cloudflare_endpoint": "172.64.241.205",
"customer_endpoint": "35.239.85.133",
"description": "Tunnel for Cisco 8000v",
"health_check": {
"enabled": true,
"target": "35.239.85.133",
"type": "reply"
}
}
]
},
"success": true,
"errors": [],
"messages": []
}
```

3. Generate Pre Shared Key (PSK) for Tunnel

Use the tunnel ID from the response in Step 2. Save the pre-shared key generated in this step as you will need it to set up tunnels on the Orchestrator.

```bash
---
header: Request
---
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/magic/ipsec_tunnels/<tunnel_id>/psk_generate?validate_only=true" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: user@example.com" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: XXXXXXXXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```bash
---
header: Response
---
{
"result": {
"ipsec_id": "<ipsec_id>",
"ipsec_tunnel_id": "<tunnel_id>",
"psk": "XXXXXXXXXX",
"psk_metadata": {
"last_generated_on": "2022-05-06T17:37:03.70965667Z"
}
},
"success": true,
"errors": [],
"messages": []
}
```

Refer to [Configure static routes](/magic-wan/how-to/configure-static-routes) for more information on configuring your static routes.

![Established GRE static routes in Cloudflare dashboard](/magic-wan/static/viptela-gre-static-routes.png)

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  IPsec tunnel configuration
</summary>
 <div class="special-class" markdown="1">

Define static routes on the 8000v router so Cloudflare can route traffic between sites.

For the purpose of the tutorial, create a route for the subnet 10.1.2.0/24 on the GCP branch to be routed via the established IPSec tunnel between the 8000v appliance and Cloudflare

Refer to [Configure static routes](/magic-wan/how-to/configure-static-routes) for more information on configuring your static routes.

</details>

## 6. Validate traffic flow

<details>
<summary>

 <div class="special-class" markdown="1">

In the example below, a request for neverssl.com was issued, which has a Cloudflare policy blocking traffic to neverssl.com.

On the client VM (192.168.30.3), a blocked response is visible.

![cURL example for a request to neverssl.com](/magic-wan/static/viptela-curl-traffic-flow.png)

A matching blocked log line is visible from the Cloudflare logs.

![A blocked log from Gateway Activity Log in the Cloudflare dashboard](/magic-wan/static/viptela-gre-swg-traffic.png)

**Validate east-west traffic**

The example shows a client in AWS (10.1.2.23), which can ping the private IP of the router in GCP (192.168.30.3).

The traceroute shows the path going from the client (10.1.2.23)<br>
→ to the AWS lan0 IP on the EdgeConnect (10.1.2.47)<br>
→ to the Cloudflare private IPSec endpoint IP (10.0.0.10)<br>
→ to the GCP private tunnel endpoint IP (10.49.0.10)<br>
→ to the GCP workload (192.168.30.3).

This validates the east-west traffic flow through Cloudflare Magic WAN.

​To validate traffic flow from the local subnet through Cloudflare’s Secure Web Gateway, perform a curl as shown in the example below.

On the client VM (192.168.30.3), a blocked response is visible.

![cURL example to validate traffic with a blocked response](/magic-wan/static/viptela-validate-traffic-curl-ipsec.png)

You can validate the request went through Gateway with the presence of the `Cf-Team` response header, or by looking at the logs in the dashboard under **Logs** > **Gateway** > **HTTP**.

![Blocked response in Secure Web Gateway](/magic-wan/static/viptela-swg-traffic-validation.png)

You can also verify traffic flow through the established IPSec tunnel on the **Cisco Device Dashboard** > **Interface**.
