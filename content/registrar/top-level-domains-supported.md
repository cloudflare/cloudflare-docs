# Top Level Domains supported

When registering or transferring a domain to Cloudflare Registrar, there are a few aspects to consider:

* If Cloudflare Registrar supports the top-level domain (TLD) in question.
* Availability of the domain you want to register.
* If you want to register a `.us` TLD.

## List of TLDs supported

Cloudflare supports over 200 [top-level domains (TLDs)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/domain-name-system-dns/) and is always evaluating adding new TLDs. You can find the full list of supported and coming soon TLDs on [our TLD policies page](https://www.cloudflare.com/tld-policies/).

If you want to register a `.us` domain refer to  [Additional requirements for .US domains](/registrar/faq/#additional-requirements-for-us-domains).

## Domain availability

During your [TLD registration process](/registrar/get-started/register-domain/#how-to-register-a-new-domain), Cloudflare Registrar will inform you if the TLD you are looking for is available to register. If it does not appear in your search list, this means that TLD is not available for registration.

Possible causes for the domain not being available include:

* Someone else owns that domain.
* It is a premium domain, that is, one with non-standard pricing, which Cloudflare Registrar does not support.
* It is an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) which Cloudflare Registrar does not support. These domains include international characters (such as `á`, `ü`, among others).
