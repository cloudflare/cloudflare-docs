# Domain management

## Domain status

When your domain is registered with Cloudflare, you can review your domain status in the **Overview** pane. 

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. From **Overview**, scroll down to **Domain Registration** to review the current expiration date. Select **Manage domain** to review the Auto-Renew status for your domain.

## Billing information

Domain registrations will not appear in the **Active Subscriptions** section of the dashboard, as Registrar is not subscription based. To check information related to your domain billing:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **Domain Registration** > **Manage Domains**.
3. Find the domain you want to check and select **Manage**.
4. Refer to **Registration** for information regarding your domain fees. From here, you can also opt to [renew or extend](/registrar/account-options/renew-domains/) your domain registration.

## Edit WHOIS records

Cloudflare redacts WHOIS information from your domain by default. However, we do store the authentic WHOIS record for your domain. You may edit the WHOIS contact data for any domain. To do that:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **Domain Registration** > **Manage Domains**.
3. Find the domain you want to edit and select **Manage** > **Contacts**.
4. Select **Edit** in any of the contacts you previously set up. This allows you to update the contact information for the selected domain only. It will not update the contact information for other domains within the account.

Refer to [Registrant contact updates](/registrar/account-options/domain-contact-updates/) for more information.

## Edit Default Contact information

The first time you transfer or register a new domain, a Cloudflare Registrar creates a Default Contact with information that can be used for future transfers and registrations. The contact data may be updated at any time in the dashboard. Updating the Default Contact data will not update the contact information for any domains already in the account. This Default Contact data is only used to prepopulate contact information for new registrations and transfers.

It is important that you keep this information accurate and up-to-date. Refer to [Registrant contact updates](/registrar/account-options/domain-contact-updates/) for important information about this topic, and to learn how to update this information.
