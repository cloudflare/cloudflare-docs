# Domains supported

When trying to register or transfer a domain to Cloudflare Registrar, there are two aspects to consider:

* If Cloudflare Registrar supports the top-level domain (TLD) in question.
* Availability of the domain you want to register.


## Top-level domains

Cloudflare Registrar supports over 200 TLDs. In the DNS hierarchy, these are what follows after the final dot of a domain name, such as `.org` or `.com`. Refer to [Top level domains supported](/registrar/why-choose-cloudflare/top-level-domains-supported/) for more information.

If you want to register a `.us` domain refer to  [Additional requirements for .US domains](/registrar/faq/#additional-requirements-for-us-domains).

## Domain availability

You also have to check if the domain you want is available to register. If the domain you are [trying to register with Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/get-started/register-domain/#how-to-register-a-new-domain) does not appear in your search list, this means it is not available for registration.

Possible causes for the domain not being available include:

* Someone else owns that domain.
* It is a premium domain, that is, one with non-standard pricing, which Cloudflare Registrar does not support.
* It is an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) which Cloudflare Registrar does not support. These domains include international characters (such as `á`, `ü`, among others).
