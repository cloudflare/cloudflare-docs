# Why choose Cloudflare

Cloudflare Registrar offers domain name registration renewal without markups or renewal fees. You only pay what is charged by registries and [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/). Cloudflare Registrar also offers additional security features, such as free, one-click activation for Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), custom domain protection, and WHOIS redaction.

You can buy your domain from Cloudflare Registrar or from a third party. Even when you buy it from a third party, you can manage your domain with Cloudflare to benefit from all the features Cloudflare offers.
