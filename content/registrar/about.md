# About Cloudflare Registrar

Cloudflare Registrar offers several advantages over other [registrars](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/), such as domain name registration renewal [without markups fees](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). You only pay what is charged by registries and [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/). Cloudflare Registrar also offers additional security features, such as free, one-click activation for [Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)](/registrar/account-options/enable-dnssec/), [custom domain protection](/registrar/reference/custom-domain-protection/), and [WHOIS redaction](/registrar/get-started/whois-redaction/).

You can buy your domain from Cloudflare Registrar or from a third party. Even when you buy it from a third party, you can manage your domain with Cloudflare to benefit from all the features Cloudflare offers.
