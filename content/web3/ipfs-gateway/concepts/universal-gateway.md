# Universal gateway

When you set up a gateway without a *DNSLink*, you are creating an unrestricted gateway that allows users to access any content hosted on the IPFS network.

This differs from a [restricted gateway](/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/dnslink/), which restricts the gateway to a particular piece of content (either a specific Content Identifier (CID) or an Interplanetary Name Service (IPNS) hostname).

## How is it used with Cloudflare?

Though Cloudflare does not currently support Universal IPFS gateways, this functionality will be coming soon.
