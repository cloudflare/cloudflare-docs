# I activated through a hosting partner. Can I still use the free Cloudflare IPv6 Compatibility?



## Overview

If you have signed up for Cloudflare through a [Cloudflare hosting partner](http://www.cloudflare.com/hosting-partners) or by using CNAME setup, you may enable the [IPv6 Compatibility](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/) feature for the record(s) that are delegated to Cloudflare, but the apex domain will not benefit from Cloudflare's free IPv6 compatibility.
