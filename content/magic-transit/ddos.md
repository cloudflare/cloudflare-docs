# Cloudflare DDoS protection

Cloudflare DDoS protection automatically detects and mitigates Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using its Autonomous Edge. Magic Transit customers have access to additional features, such as:

- [Advanced TCP protection](/ddos-protection/tcp-protection/) (disabled by default)
- [Advanced DNS protection (beta)](/ddos-protection/dns-protection/)

Refer to [Cloudflare DDoS documentation](/ddos-protection/) for more information.
