#  Configure tunnel endpoints

Cloudflare recommends two tunnels for each ISP and network location router combination, one per Cloudflare endpoint. Cloudflare will assign two Cloudflare endpoint addresses shortly after your onboarding kickoff call that you can use as the tunnel destinations on your network location's routers/endpoints.

To configure the tunnels between Cloudflare and your locations, you must provide the following data for each tunnel:

- **Tunnel name**: A name with 15 or fewer characters that does not contain spaces or special characters. The name cannot be shared with other tunnels.
- **Cloudflare endpoint address**: The public IP address of the Cloudflare side of the tunnel.
- **Customer endpoint**: A public Internet routable IP address outside of the prefixes Cloudflare will advertise on your behalf. These are generally IP addresses provided by your ISP. If you intend to use a physical or virtual connection like [Cloudflare Network Interconnect](/network-interconnect/), you do not need to provide endpoints because Cloudflare will provide them. <br> 
This value is not required for IPsec tunnels, unless your router is using an IKE ID of type `ID_IPV4_ADDR`.
- **Interface address**: A 31-bit (recommended) or 30-bit subnet (`/31` or `/30` in CIDR notation) supporting two hosts, one for each side of the tunnel. Select the subnet from the following private IP space:
  - `10.0.0.0/8`
  - `172.16.0.0/12`
  - `192.168.0.0/16`
  - $1
- **TTL**: Time to Live (TTL) in number of hops for the GRE tunnel. The default value is 64.
- **MTU**: Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) in bytes for the GRE tunnel. The default value is 1476.

## Tunnels

### GRE tunnels

You can set up GRE tunnels through the Cloudflare dashboard or via the API. However, if you want to use the API, be sure to have your [account ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and [API key](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#view-your-global-api-key) ready before you begin.

### IPsec tunnels

You can [use IPsec]($4) as an on-ramp to connect with your entire virtual network. With an IPsec tunnel, you can route traffic from your network to Cloudflare's global network and define static routes to direct traffic down the correct tunnel.

You can set up IPsec tunnels through the Cloudflare dashboard or via the API. However, if you want to use the API, be sure to have your [account ID](/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and [API key](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#view-your-global-api-key) ready before you begin.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}$2 only supports Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2).{{</Aside>}}

#### Anti-replay protection

If you use $2 and Anycast IPsec tunnels, we recommend disabling anti-replay protection. This setting is disabled on Cloudflare’s side by default. However, it can be enabled via the API or the Cloudflare dashboard for devices that do not support disabling it, including Cisco Meraki, Velocloud, and AWS VPN Gateway.

Refer to [Anti-replay protection]($9) for more information on this topic, or [Add IPsec tunnels](#add-tunnels) below to learn how to enable this feature.

### Technical requirements for GRE and IPsec tunnels

Refer to [Tunnels and encapsulation]($6) to learn about the technical requirements for GRE and IPsec tunnels used in $2.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Bidirectional health checks are available for GRE and IPsec tunnels. For Magic WAN this option defaults to bidirectional, while for Magic Transit it defaults to unidirectional. Refer to [Bidirectional vs unidirectional health checks](#bidirectional-vs-unidirectional-health-checks) for more details.
{{</Aside>}}

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select $3.
3. From the **Tunnels** tab, select **Create**.
4. On the **Add tunnels** page, choose either a **GRE tunnel** or **IPsec tunnel**.

<details>
<summary>GRE tunnel</summary>
<div>
 
5. In **Tunnel name**, give your tunnel a descriptive name. This name must be unique, must not contain spaces or special characters, and must be 15 or fewer characters. Hover the mouse over `i` in the dashboard for more information.
6. Give your tunnel a description in **Description**. You do not have character restrictions here.
7. In **Interface address**, enter the internal IP address for your tunnel along with the interface’s prefix length (either `/31` or `/30`). This is used to route traffic through the tunnel on the Cloudflare side. We recommend using an RFC1918 address scheme with a `/31` netmask, as it provides the most efficient use of IP address space.
8. In **Customer GRE endpoint**, enter your router’s public IP address.
9. In **Cloudflare GRE endpoint**, enter the Anycast address you received from your account team (typically begins with `172.x.x.x`).
10. Leave the default values for **TTL** and **MTU**.
11. Choose the [**Health check rate**]($7) for your tunnel. Available options are _Low_, _Medium_ and _High_.
12. The **Health check type** defaults to _Reply_ and to creating an ICMP reply. If your firewall drops this type of packet for assuming it is a type of attack, change this option to _Request_ which will create an ICMP request. Refer to [Tunnel health checks]($8) for more information.
13. The **Health check direction** defaults to **bidirectional** for Magic WAN, and **unidirectional** for Magic Transit. Refer to [Bidirectional vs unidirectional health checks](#bidirectional-vs-unidirectional-health-checks) for more details.
14. **Health check target** is the customer end of the tunnel.
15. _(Optional)_ We recommend you test your tunnel before officially adding it. To test the tunnel, select **Test tunnels**.
16. To add multiple tunnels, select **Add GRE tunnel** for each new tunnel.
17. After adding your tunnel information, select **Add tunnels** to save your changes.

Create a `POST` request [using the API](/api/operations/magic-gre-tunnels-create-gre-tunnels) to create a GRE tunnel. You will need your [API Key](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#view-your-global-api-key).

Example:

```bash
curl --request https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/gre_tunnels \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>' \
--data '{

    {
      "name": "<TUNNEL_NAME>",
      "description": "<TUNNEL_DESCRIPTION>",
      "interface_address": "<INTERFACE_ADDRESS>",
      "cloudflare_gre_endpoint": "<CLOUDFLARE_ENDPOINT>",
      "customer_gre_endpoint": "<CUSTOMER_ENDPOINT>"
    }
  ]
}'
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>IPsec tunnel</summary>
<div>

1. Create a `POST` request [using the API](/api/operations/magic-ipsec-tunnels-create-ipsec-tunnels) to create an IPsec tunnel. You will need your [API Key](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/#view-your-global-api-key).

Note that in example below, replay protection is disabled by default. You can enable it with the flag `"replay_protection": true` for each IPsec tunnel, if the devices you use do not support disabling this feature. If you have already created IPsec tunnels, update them with a [`PUT` request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/magic-ipsec-tunnels-update-ipsec-tunnel). <br> Refer to Refer to [Anti-replay protection]($9) for more information on this topic.

Example:

```bash
curl --request https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/ipsec_tunnels \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>' \
--data '{
  "ipsec_tunnels": [
    {
      "name": "<TUNNEL_NAME>", 
      "description": "<TUNNEL_DESCRIPTION>", 
      "interface_address": "<INTERFACE_ADDRESS>", 
      "cloudflare_endpoint": "<CLOUDFLARE_ENDPOINT>",
      "customer_endpoint": "<CUSTOMER_ENDPOINT>",
      "replay_protection": false
    }
  ]
}'
```

This will generate a response like the following:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "ipsec_tunnels": [
      {
        "id": "<YOUR_TUNNEL_ID>",
        "interface_address": "<INTERFACE_ADDRESS>",
        "created_on": "2023-04-21T10:42:22.138586Z",

        "customer_endpoint": "<CUSTOMER_ENDPOINT>",
        "remote_identities": {
          "hex_id": "<HEX_ID>",
          "fqdn_id": "<FQDN_ID>.ipsec.cloudflare.com",
          "user_id": "ipsec@<USER_ID>.ipsec.cloudflare.com"
        },
        "description": " test",
        "health_check": {
          "enabled": true,
          "target": "<TARGET>",
          "type": "reply",
          "rate": "mid"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

2. Create a `POST` request to generate a PSK. Use the tunnel `id` you received from the previous command (exemplified by `<YOUR_TUNNEL_ID>` above):

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/ipsec_tunnels/{your_tunnel_id}/psk_generate \
--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' 
--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>'
```

You will receive a response like the following:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "ipsec_id": "<IPSEC_ID>",
    "ipsec_tunnel_id": "<IPSEC_TUNNEL>",
    "psk": "<YOUR_PSK_KEY>",
    "psk_metadata": {
      "last_generated_on": "2023-04-21T10:48:15.953887008Z"
    }
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

3. Use the above `psk` value to configure the IPsec tunnel on your equipment. You do not need to take further action to use the PSK on Cloudflare’s side, as this value is automatically set.

<summary>Configure bidirectional health checks</summary>
<div>

Bidirectional health checks are available for GRE and IPsec tunnels. For Magic WAN this option defaults to bidirectional, while for Magic Transit it defaults to unidirectional.

You can enable bidirectional health checks via the API with `--data '{"health_check": {"direction": "bidirectional"}}'`. For example: 

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/ipsec_tunnels \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
--header 'X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>' \
--data '{"health_check": {"direction": "bidirectional"}}'
```
 
{{</tab>}}
{{</tabs>}}

## Bidirectional vs unidirectional health checks

To check for tunnel health, Cloudflare sends a health check probe consisting of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) reply packets to your network. Cloudflare needs to receive these probes to know if your tunnel is healthy.

Cloudflare defaults to bidirectional health checks for Magic WAN, and unidirectional health checks for Magic Transit. However, routing unidirectional ICMP reply packets over the Internet to Cloudflare is sometimes subject to drops by intermediate network devices, such as stateful firewalls. Change your settings to bidirectional health checks if you feel you are experiencing this problem.

Refer to [Tunnel Health Checks]($8) to learn more.

## Next steps

Now that you have set up your tunnel endpoints, you need to configure [static routes]($5) to route your traffic through Cloudflare.

Refer to [Tunnels]($6) for more information on how $2 tunnels work.
