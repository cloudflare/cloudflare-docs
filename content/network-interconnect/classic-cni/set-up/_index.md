# Classic CNI setup

Setup starts with onboarding, which is broken out into a few steps. During onboarding, Cloudflare works closely with your organization to accomplish the onboarding tasks:
- [Scope your configuration](/network-interconnect/classic-cni/set-up/scope-config/) (Kickoff call)
- [Configure the network cross-connect](/network-interconnect/classic-cni/set-up/configure-cross-connect/) (Duration: 1-2 weeks)
- [Configure Cloudflare Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](/network-interconnect/classic-cni/set-up/configure-bgp-bfd/) (Duration: 1 week)
- [Go live](/network-interconnect/classic-cni/set-up/configure-bgp-bfd/#go-live) (Duration: 1-2 days)
