# Cloudflare Network Interconnect 2.0

Cloudflare Network Interconnect 2.0 (CNI 2.0) allows you to connect your network infrastructure directly with Cloudflare – rather than using the public Internet – for a more reliable and secure experience.

Connecting to Cloudflare directly with a CNI reduces latency, makes your network more stable by bypassing Internet performance potential bottlenecks, and may even reduce your ISP bandwidth bills. CNI also gives you more control over how Cloudflare routes traffic back to your network.

CNI 2.0 allows you to directly order a CNI connection from the Cloudflare dashboard. In the Cloudflare dashboard you can find Cloudflare's nearest Cloudflare data center, and order a CNI connection with speeds up to 100 gigabits per second, as well as create a Letter of Authorization.
