# Cloudflare Network Interconnect Setup

Setup starts with onboarding, which is broken out into a few steps. During onboarding, Cloudflare works closely with your organization to accomplish the onboarding tasks:

-   [Scope your configuration](/network-interconnect/set-up-cni/scope-config/) (Kickoff call)
-   [Configure the network cross-connect](/network-interconnect/set-up-cni/configure-cross-connect/) (Duration: 1-2 weeks)
-   [Configure Cloudflare Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE)](/network-interconnect/set-up-cni/configure-bgp/) (Duration: ~1 week)
-   [Go live](/network-interconnect/set-up-cni/configure-bgp/#go-live) (Duration: 1-2 days)
