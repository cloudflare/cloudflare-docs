# Cloudflare Network Interconnect Setup

Setup requires a few steps: onboarding, configuring the cross-connection, configuring the Cloudflare Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and go live. The entire process from onboarding to go live typically takes 10-15 days.

## Onboarding

During onboarding, Cloudflare works closely with your organization to accomplish the onboarding tasks.
