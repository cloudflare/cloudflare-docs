# Automated Deployment

Static sites are pretty easy to deploy automatically. The code of the site is
usually kept in a Git repository and deployed by pushing the latest commit to a
repository that's connected to a Continuous Integration service like [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/), or by pushing to a repository directly on the
server and activating a post-receive hook. Either way, the production version of
the site is built and then copied into the serving path of an Apache or Nginx
instance.

IPFS usually fits pretty easily into these systems: instead of copying the
production version of a website into the serving path of an HTTP server, you'd
upload the same files to an IPFS node and update your DNS records with the new
hash. There are several tools that help with different parts of this:

- [ipfs-deploy](https://github.com/agentofuser/ipfs-deploy) helps upload data to
  a third-party pinning providers, and automatically update Cloudflare-managed
  DNS records.
- [dnslink-cloudflare](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/dnslink-cloudflare) is a
  script to programmatically update DNSLink records. This can be run with the
  `-Q` flag of `ipfs add` that only outputs the top-level hash.
- [Fission's IPNS support](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/custom-domains/using-cloudflare-ipfs-gateway) 
  lets you use the Fission IPFS app publishing system from the CLI
  or from GitHub Actions, while using Cloudflare-managed DNS and gateway.
