# Control traffic egress with source IP anchoring and allowlisting

Now that you have created firewall policies to secure your organization, you can begin creating egress policies to control what IP address your users egress to the Internet with.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

The following module requires [egress policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/), a feature only available on Enterprise plans. If you are not an Enterprise user, you can skip ahead to [Secure SaaS applications](/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/secure-saas-applications/).

For more information on egress policies, contact your account team.
