## Best practices

Securing your organization with Zero Trust usually happens in two phases: the first phase is establishing connectivity, and the second phase is building policies for distinct applications. We recommend verifying that all connectivity is working as expected before moving on to build complex security policies. This will reduce the amount of troubleshooting and challenges that arise from managing complex systems.
