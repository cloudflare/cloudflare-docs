Many organizations rely on VPNs to protect their data, but for many reasons, VPNs are often not ideal for defending against today's risks. Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is the main technology that enables organizations to transition from a traditional VPN configuration to a more secure and modern approach. 

VPN configurations have not scaled with today's access requirements. Some of the  often grant users, once authenticated, to the entire internal network. Often, access is only needed one time during the initial connection. 

, which might provide broader access, potentially exposing more entry points for attackers. By adopting a Zero Trust approach, organizations will significantly reduce their attack surface by limiting access to resources based on a user's specific needs. 

In summary, Zero Trust for VPNs provides a more dynamic and adaptive security model that aligns with the current challenges of a distributed and diverse digital landscape. It enhances security by assuming that trust is never implicit and should be continuously verified.


Traditional VPNs create a perimeter-based security model where users gain access to the internal network once they are authenticated. In the modern digital landscape, where users can access resources from various locations and devices, the concept of a fixed perimeter is no longer effective.
Zero Trust assumes that threats may exist both inside and outside the network, so it requires continuous verification of the identity and security posture of users and devices, regardless of their location.
Least Privilege Access:

Zero Trust emphasizes the principle of least privilege, meaning that users are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. In contrast, traditional VPNs may provide broader access once a user is authenticated, potentially leading to unnecessary exposure and risks.
Continuous Authentication:

Zero Trust relies on continuous authentication and authorization. Instead of a one-time authentication during the initial connection to the VPN, users and devices are continuously verified throughout their session.
This continuous monitoring helps detect anomalies and unauthorized activities promptly, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
Micro-Segmentation:

Zero Trust often involves the implementation of micro-segmentation, where the network is divided into smaller segments, and access is strictly controlled between these segments.
Traditional VPNs may not provide as granular control over network access, increasing the risk of lateral movement by attackers within the network.
Adaptability to Cloud Environments:

Zero Trust is well-suited for cloud environments where resources may be distributed across multiple platforms and services. It allows organizations to implement security policies based on the identity and context of users and devices, rather than relying solely on network location.
