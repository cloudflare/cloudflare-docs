To make the most of this tutorial, make sure that you have the following:

1. A device that can run WARP, Cloudflare's endpoint agent.
2. A private network with applications or services that are available locally or via a VPN.
3. A host server that can run the lightweight Cloudflare Tunnel daemon process (requirements).
4. The ability for that host server to connect to the Internet on the required ports and to connect locally to the private network applications.
