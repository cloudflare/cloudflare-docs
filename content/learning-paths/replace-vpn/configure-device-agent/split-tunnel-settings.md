Split tunnel settings determine which traffic WARP does and does not proxy.

WARP offers two different split tunnel modes:

- If you intend to send all internal and external destination traffic through Cloudflare's global network, opt for **Exclude IPs and domains** mode. This mode will proxy everything through the WARP tunnel with the exception of IPs and hosts defined explicitly within the Split Tunnel list.

- If you intend to only use WARP to proxy private destination traffic, you can operate in **Include IPs and domains** mode, in which you explicitly define which IP ranges and domains should be included in the WARP routing table.
