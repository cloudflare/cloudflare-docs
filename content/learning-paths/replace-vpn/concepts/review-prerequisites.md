To make the most of this tutorial, make sure that you have the following:

1. A device that can run WARP, Cloudflare's endpoint agent.
2. A private network with applications or services that are available locally or via a VPN.
3. A host server that can run the lightweight Cloudflare Tunnel daemon process [requirements](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/system-requirements/).
4. The ability for that host server to connect to the Internet on the required ports and to connect locally to the private network applications.
