A few ways to optimize Cloudflare caching include:

- Creating [cache rules](/cache/about/cache-rules/) to customize the cache properties of specific HTTP requests.
- Enabling the [Tiered Cache](/cache/about/tiered-cache/) feature, which dramatically increases cache hit ratios.
- Reviewing our other various [configuration options](/cache/get-started/), which may vary based on your plan and application setup.
