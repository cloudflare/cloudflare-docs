When your DNS records are [proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) through Cloudflare, Cloudflare provides free and unmetered DDoS protection and other protection measures through the Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Managed rulesets

All customers have access to the Cloudflare Free Managed Ruleset, which provides mitigations against high and wide-impacting vulnerabilities.

For more details, refer to the [WAF documentation](/waf/managed-rules/).
