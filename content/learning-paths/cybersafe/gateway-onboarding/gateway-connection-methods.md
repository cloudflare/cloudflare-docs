There are various methods to onboard your traffic and your method will be determined based on your individual or organizational requirements. In this learning path, we will focus on an [**Agentless (DNS only) deployment method**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/). 

Protecting more than DNS, such as network packets, HTTP requests, or egress traffic is possible, but requires a more advanced deployment method such as [WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/) or [Magic WAN](/magic-wan/zero-trust/cloudflare-gateway/).
