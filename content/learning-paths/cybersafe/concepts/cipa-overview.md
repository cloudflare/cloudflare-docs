Project Cybersafe Schools (PCS) grants eligible schools free access to Cloudflare’s Email Security and Gateway products.

Like other under-resourced organizations, schools face cyber attacks from malicious actors that can impact schools’ ability to safely perform a basic function – teach children. Schools face email, phishing, and ransomware attacks that slow access and threaten leaks of confidential student data.

PCS will help support small K-12 public school districts, for free, by providing cloud email security to protect against a broad spectrum of threats including malware-less business email compromise, multichannel phishing, credential harvesting, and other targeted attacks. PCS will also protect against Internet threats with DNS filtering by preventing users from reaching unwanted or harmful online content like ransomware or phishing sites and can be deployed to comply with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA).
