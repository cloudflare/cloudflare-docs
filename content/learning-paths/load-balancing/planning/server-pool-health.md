### Monitor-level settings

When you [create a monitor](/load-balancing/how-to/create-monitor/), there are several configuration settings you can adjust based on the characteristics of the attached pools:

{{<details header="Basic settings">}}

{{<render file=_monitor-settings-basic.md productFolder="load-balancing">}}

</div>
</details>

{{<details header="Advanced settings">}}

{{<render file=_monitor-settings-advanced.md productFolder="load-balancing">}}

</div>
</details>

{{<render file=_monitor-settings-consecutive.md productFolder="load-balancing">}}

You also need to decide which of the associated pools in a load balancer should be the fallback pool.
