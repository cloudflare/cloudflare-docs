## Customizations

Based on the characteristics of your server pools, you have several customization options that affect how and whether a server is considered unhealthy.

### Monitor-level settings

When you [create a monitor](/load-balancing/how-to/create-monitor/), there are several configuration settings you can adjust based on the characteristics of the attached pools:

<summary>Basic settings</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced settings</summary>
<div>

</details>

You also need to decide which of the associated pools in a load balancer should be the fallback pool.
