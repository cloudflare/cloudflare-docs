## Project Cybersafe Schools

Like other under-resourced organizations, schools face cyber attacks from malicious actors that can impact schools’ ability to safely perform a basic function – teach children. Schools face email, phishing, and ransomware attacks that slow access and threaten leaks of confidential student data.

Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet. It is our pleasure to introduce an initiative aimed at K-12 public school districts: Project Cybersafe Schools.

Project Cybersafe Schools will help support small K-12 public school districts, for free, by providing cloud email security to protect against a broad spectrum of threats including malware-less Business Email Compromise, multichannel phishing, credential harvesting, and other targeted attacks. Project Cybersafe Schools will also protect against Internet threats with DNS filtering by preventing users from reaching unwanted or harmful online content like ransomware or phishing sites and can be deployed to comply with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA).
