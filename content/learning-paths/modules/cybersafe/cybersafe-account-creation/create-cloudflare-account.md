To create a new Cloudflare account:

1. [Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) on the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. To secure your account, enable [two-factor authentication](/support/account-management-billing/account-privacy-and-security/securing-user-access-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

3. After your account is accepted into the Cybersafe Schools program, you can to reach out to your Cloudflare contact and ask them to set up your account as a multi-user organization. This will allow you to define [role based access](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/members/roles/) controls. For this project, account members will need:
    - [**Gateway** permissions](/cloudflare-one/cloudflare-teams-roles-permissions/) to read or edit DNS policies.
    - [**PII** permissions](/cloudflare-one/cloudflare-teams-roles-permissions/#cloudflare-zero-trust-pii) to view user information in DNS logs.
    - [**Configuration** permissions](/email-security/account-setup/permissions/) for Area 1 Email Security.
