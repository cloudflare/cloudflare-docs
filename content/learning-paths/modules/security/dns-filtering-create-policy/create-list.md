In the context of DNS filtering, a blocklist is a list of known harmful domains or IP addresses. An allowlist is a list of allowed domains or IP addresses, such as the domains of essential corporate applications.

Gateway supports creating [lists](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/lists/) of URLs, hostnames, or other entries to reference in your policies.
