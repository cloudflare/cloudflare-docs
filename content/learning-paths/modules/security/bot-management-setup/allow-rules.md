Based on your [application's traffic](/learning-paths/modules/security/bot-management-setup/review-analytics/?learning_path=bot-management), you should create [firewall rules](/firewall/cf-dashboard/create-edit-delete-rules/) that explicitly allow expected automated or likely automated traffic.

If you only use a specific characteristic for your allow rules (such as the user-agent), it could be discovered by malicious bots and expose your application to automated abuse.
