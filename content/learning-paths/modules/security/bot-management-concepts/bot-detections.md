When a request reaches Cloudflare, we run that request through a variety of detection engines to determine whether it came from a bot.

These detections run on all requests coming into the Cloudflare global network, not just for applications using Bot Management.

This means that:

- Adding bot management does not add latency to requests.
- Our bot management platform benefits from the millions of sites and trillions of requests that flow thorugh Cloudflare every day.
