## Workers concepts

Cloudflare Workers allow you to build web functions and applications without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. Workers are deployed globally to over 300+ data centers around the world on Cloudflare’s global network.

Before you begin building with Workers, review the following reference material to understand how Workers works.

### Serverless computing

To understand the fundamentals of Workers technology, refer to these Cloudflare Learning Center articles on [serverless computing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/), [containers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/) and [serverless JavaScript](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-javascript/).

### Workers

Explore Cloudflare Workers developer documentation by starting with [How Workers works](/workers/reference/how-workers-works/), and learn the difference between the Workers runtime versus traditional browsers and Node.js. If you are a Node.js user, review [Node.js compatibility](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) in the Workers documentation.

### The cache

Learn how Workers interacts with the Cloudflare cache by reading [How the cache works](/workers/reference/how-the-cache-works/).

### Developer Platform

Cloudflare Workers is part of the [Cloudflare Developer Platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/). You will explore this topic in [module 5](/learning-paths/workers/#build-applications-with-cloudflares-developer-platform).
