## Workers concepts

Cloudflare Workers allow you to build web functions and applications without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. Workers are deployed globally to over 300+ data centers around the world on Cloudflareâ€™s global network.

Before you begin building with Workers, review the following reference material to understand how Workers works.

### Serverless computing

Read this Cloudflare Learning Center article on [serverless computing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/), [containers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/) and the [difference between service workers and Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-javascript/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20key%20differences,of%20the%20Internet%2C%20effectively%20running) to understand the fundamentals of Workers technology.

### Workers

Explore Cloudflare Workers developer documentation by starting with [How Workers works](/workers/learning/how-workers-works/), and learn the difference between the Workers runtime versus traditional browsers and Node.js. If you are a Node.js user, review [Node.js compatibility](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) in the Workers documentation.

### The cache
