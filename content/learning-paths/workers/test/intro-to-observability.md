## Local development and logs

You learned how to write tests in the [Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/). Now, you will learn how to locally develop and log from your Worker.

### Local development

Refer to [Local development and testing](/workers/observability/local-development-and-testing/) to learn how to test your Worker locally with `wrangler dev`.

### Logs

Read [Log from Workers](/workers/observability/log-from-workers/) to learn how to debug your Worker by accessing logs and exceptions through the Cloudflare dashboard or `wrangler tail`.

### Related resources

To explore more observability, debugging and testing options for Workers, refer to [Observability](/workers/observability/) in the Workers documentation.
