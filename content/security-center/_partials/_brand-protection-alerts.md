Brand Protection works with Cloudflareâ€™s ANS (Alerts Notification Service) to provide configurable alerts when new domains are detected. 

Any matches that are found during the new domain search are then inserted into an internal alerts table which triggers an alert for the user. This allows you to receive real-time notifications and take immediate action to investigate and potentially block any suspicious domains that may be attempting to impersonate your brand.
