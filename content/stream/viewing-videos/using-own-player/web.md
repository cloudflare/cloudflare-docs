Cloudflare Stream works with all web video players that support HLS and DASH.

{{<render file="_prereqs.md">}}

## Examples

To help you get started, review the example implementations of Stream with popular open-source video players below:

* [Video.js](/stream/examples/video-js/)
* [HLS reference player (hls.js)](/stream/examples/hls-js/)
* [DASH reference player (dash.js)](/stream/examples/dash-js/)
* [Vidstack](/stream/examples/vidstack/)

Before you can implement one of the examples above, you must first [fetch the HLS and DASH manifest URLs](/stream/viewing-videos/using-own-player/#fetch-hls-and-dash-manifests/).
