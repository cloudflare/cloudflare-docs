Serverless live and on-demand streaming

Cloudflare Stream lets you or your end users upload, store, encode, and deliver live and on-demand video with one API, without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

You can use Stream to build your own video features in websites and native apps, from simple playback to an entire video platform.

Cloudflare Stream runs on [Cloudflareâ€™s global cloud network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) in over 270 cities around the world.
