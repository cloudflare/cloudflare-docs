# Analytics

Stream provides both server-side and client-side analytics that can be used to:

- Identify most viewed video content in your app or platform.
- Identify where content is viewed from and when it is viewed.
- Understand which creators on your platform are publishing the most viewed content, and analyze trends.
- Provide data to your billing system about how many minutes of video each of your customers or end-users stream during a given period.

You can access data via the [Stream dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/stream/analytics) or via the [GraphQL Analytics API](/stream/getting-analytics/fetching-bulk-analytics).
