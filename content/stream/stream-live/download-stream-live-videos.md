# Download live stream videos

You can enable downloads for live stream videos from the Cloudflare dashboard. Videos are available for download after they enter the **Ready** state.

Downloadable MP4s are only available for live recordings under four hours. Live recordings exceeding four hours can be played at a later time but cannot be downloaded as an MP4.
