# Default Cache Behavior

Cloudflare respects the origin web server’s cache headers in the following order unless an [Edge Cache TTL cache rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/settings/#edge-ttl) overrides the headers. Refer to the [Edge TTL](/cache/how-to/configure-cache-status-code/#edge-ttl) section for details on default TTL behavior.

- Cloudflare **does not** cache the resource when:
  - The `Cache-Control` header is set to `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`, or `max-age=0`.
  - The [`Set-Cookie` header](/cache/concepts/cache-behavior/#interaction-of-set-cookie-response-header-with-cache) exists.
  - The HTTP request method is anything other than a `GET`.
- Cloudflare **does** cache the resource when:
  - The `Cache-Control` header is set to `public` and `max-age` is greater than 0.
  - The `Expires` header is set to a future date.

{{<Aside type="note">}}Cloudflare does cache the resource even if there is no `Cache-Control` header based on [status codes](/cache/how-to/configure-cache-status-code/#edge-ttl).{{</Aside>}}

{{<Aside type="note">}}If both `max-age` and an `Expires` header are set, `max-age` will be used by Cloudflare.{{</Aside>}}

When [Origin Cache Control](/cache/concepts/cache-control/) is enabled on an Enterprise customer’s website, it indicates that Cloudflare should strictly respect `Cache-Control` directives received from the origin server. Free, Pro and Business customers have this feature enabled by default. For a list of directives and behaviors when Origin Cache-Control is enabled or disabled, refer to [Cache-Control directives](/cache/concepts/cache-control/#cache-control-directives).

## Default cached file extensions

Cloudflare only caches based on file extension and not by MIME type. The Cloudflare CDN does not cache HTML or JSON by default. Additionally, Cloudflare caches a website’s robots.txt.

To cache additional content, refer to [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) to create a rule to cache everything.

## Customization options and limits

Cloudflare’s CDN provides several cache customization options:

- Caching behavior for individual URLs via [Cache Rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/)
- Customize caching with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/reference/how-the-cache-works/)
- Adjust caching level, cache TTL, and more via the Cloudflare Caching app

### Upload limits

{{<feature-table id="network.max_upload_size">}}

If you require a larger upload, group requests smaller than the upload thresholds or upload the full resource through an [unproxied (grey-clouded) DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/).

### Cacheable size limits

Cloudflare cacheable file limits:

- Free, Pro and Business customers have a limit of 512 MB.
- For Enterprise customers the default maximum cacheable file size is 5 GB. Contact your account team to request a limit increase.

## When does Cloudflare cache successfully?

The connection status between visitors and Cloudflare can vary, affecting whether Cloudflare caches the content or not. If Cloudflare has already established a connection to the origin and started fetching the content, it will continue to retrieve and cache the entire content, even if the visitor disconnects midway. However, if a visitor disconnects before the origin responds to Cloudflare's request, no content will have been fetched yet, so Cloudflare will not start caching the content.
