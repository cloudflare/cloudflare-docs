# Default Cache Behavior

Cloudflare respects the origin web server’s cache headers in the following order unless an Edge Cache TTL page rule overrides the headers.

- Cloudflare **does not** cache the resource when:
  - The `Cache-Control` header is set to `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`, or `max-age=0`.
  - The [`Set-Cookie` header](/cache/best-practices/cache-behavior/#interaction-of-set-cookie-response-header-with-cache) exists.
- Cloudflare **does** cache the resource when:
  - The `Cache-Control` header is set to `public` and `max-age` is greater than 0. Note that Cloudflare does cache the resource even if there is no `Cache-Control` header based on [status codes](/cache/how-to/configure-cache-status-code/#edge-ttl). 
  - The `Expires` header is set to a future date.

Note: If both `max-age` and an `Expires` header are set, `max-age` will be used by Cloudflare.

For a list of directives and behaviors when Origin Cache-Control is enabled or disabled, see [Cache-Control directives](/cache/about/cache-control/#cache-control-directives).

## Default cached file extensions

Cloudflare only caches based on file extension and not by MIME type. The Cloudflare CDN does not cache HTML by default. Additionally, Cloudflare caches a website’s robots.txt.

| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | --- |
| 7Z    | CSV  | GIF  | MIDI | PNG  | TIF   | ZIP |
| AVI   | DOC  | GZ   | MKV  | PPT  | TIFF  | ZST |
| AVIF  | DOCX | ICO  | MP3  | PPTX | TTF   |

| CSS   | FLAC | MID  | PLS  | TAR  | XLSX  |

To cache additional content, see [Page Rules](/cache/how-to/create-page-rules/) to create a rule to cache everything.

## Customization options and limitations

Cloudflare’s CDN provides several cache customization options:

- Caching behavior for individual URLs via [Cloudflare Page Rules](/cache/how-to/create-page-rules/)
- Customize caching with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/learning/how-the-cache-works/)
- Adjust caching level, cache TTL, and more via the Cloudflare Caching app

Cloudflare limits the upload size (HTTP POST request size) per plan type:

- 100MB Free and Pro
- 200MB Business
- 500MB Enterprise by default. Contact [Customer Support](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172476) to request a limit increase.

If you require a larger upload, group requests smaller than the upload thresholds or upload the full resource through an [unproxied (grey-clouded) DNS record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/).

Cloudflare cacheable file limits:

- Free, Pro and Business customers have a limit of 512 MB.
- For Enterprise customers the default maximum cacheable file size is 5 GB. Contact your account team to request a limit increase.

## Cloudflare cache responses

The output of the `CF-Cache-Status` header shows whether or not a resource is cached. To investigate cache responses returned by the `CF-Cache-Status` header, use services like [Redbot](https://redbot.org/), [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/), or a visual tool like [Chrome’s Dr. Flare plugin](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/community-tip-dr-flare-debug-tool-for-cloudflare-chrome-extension/110166).

        Cloudflare generated a response that denotes the asset is not eligible for caching. This may have happened because:
          <li>A Worker generated a response without sending any subrequests. In this case, the response did not come from cache, so the cache status will be <code>none/unknown</code>.
          <li>A Worker request made a subrequest (<code>fetch</code>). In this case, the subrequest will be logged with a cache status, while the main request will be logged with <code>none/unknown</code> status (the main request did not hit cache, since Workers sits in front of cache).</li>
          <li>A Firewall rule was triggered to block a request. The response will come from the edge network before it hits cache. Since there is no cache status, Cloudflare will log as <code>none/unknown</code>.</li>
          <li>A redirect page rule caused the edge network to respond with a redirect to another asset/URL. This redirect response happens before the request reaches cache, so the cache status is <code>none/unknown</code>.</li>

        Cloudflare originally preferred to cache the asset. BYPASS is returned when enabling <a href="/cache/about/cache-control/">Origin Cache-Control</a>. Cloudflare also sets BYPASS when
        your origin web server sends cookies in the response header.
