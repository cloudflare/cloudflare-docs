# Cache Keys

A Cache Key is an identifier that Cloudflare uses for a file in our cache, and the Cache Key Template defines the identifier for a given HTTP request. For example, consider the following HTTP request on a TLS connection:

```
GET /logo.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: www.cloudflare.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36
Accept: image/jpg
```

The default Cache Key constructed from this request combines aspects such as Cloudflare Zone ID, scheme, hostname, and path into a Cache Key similar to  `1234:https://www.example.com/foo.jpg`. Zone ID and Path are always included in the Cache Key and cannot be modified.

Using Custom Cache Keys may result in cache sharding and reduction of your cache hit ratio.

To create a Cache Key, see [Create a Custom Cache Key](/how-to/create-cache-keys).

## Cache Key Template

There are a couple of common reasons to change the Cache Key Template. You might change the Cache Key Template to:

- Fragment the cache so one URL is stored in multiple files. For example, to store different files based on a specific query string in the URL.
- Consolidate the cache so different HTTP requests are stored in the same file. For example, to remove the Origin header added to Cloudflare Cache Keys by default.

<Aside type="note" header="Note">

`$scheme` is the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) sent to your origin web server and not the protocol received from the visitor. Therefore, setting the Cloudflare [SSL option](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170416) influences caching decisions. For instance, Cloudflare only attempts to connect to your origin web server via HTTP when [Flexible SSL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes#flexible) is utilized. Thus, Cloudflare serves the same cached resource for visitor requests via either HTTP or HTTPS since Flexible SSL instructs Cloudflare to connect to an origin solely over HTTP.

</Aside>

For cross-origin requests, such as one from `anotherdomain.com` to `example.com`, the Origin HTTP request header results in a Cache Key with the `${header:origin}` token populated as `anotherdomain.com::https://www.example.com/something`.

A [Cache Level](/how-to/set-caching-levels) of Ignore Query String creates the following Cache Key:
`${header:origin}::${scheme}://${host_header}${uri_iqs}`

`${uri_iqs}` is replaced with the request path excluding the query string, so a request for `http://example.com/file.jpg?something=123` creates the following Cache Key:
`::http://example.com/file.jpg`

## Cache Key Settings

The following fields control the Cache Key Template.

### Query String

The query string controls which URL query string parameters go into the Cache Key. You can `include` specific query string parameters or `exclude` them using the respective fields. When you include a query string parameter, the `value` of the query string parameter is used in the Cache Key. 

#### Example

If you include the query string foo in a URL like `https://www.example.com/?foo=bar`, then bar appears in the Cache Key. Exactly one of `include` or `exclude` is expected.

#### Usage notes 

- To include all query string parameters (the default behavior), use include: "*"
- To ignore query strings, use exclude: "*"
- To include most query string parameters but exclude a few, use the exclude field which assumes  the other query string parameters are included.

### Headers

Headers control which headers go into the Cache Key. Similar to Query String, you can include specific headers or exclude default headers. 

When you include a header, the header value is included in the Cache Key. For example, if an HTTP request contains an HTTP header like `X-Auth-API-key: 12345`, and you include the `X-Auth-API-Key header` in your Cache Key Template, then `12345` appears in the Cache Key.

To check for the presence of a header without including its actual value, use the `check_presence` option.

Currently, you can only exclude the `Origin` header. The `Origin` header is always included unless explicitly excluded. Including the [Origin header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) in the Cache Key is important to enforce [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS). Additionally, you cannot include the following headers:

- Headers that have high cardinality and risk sharding the cache
  - `accept`
  - `accept-charset`
  - `accept-encoding`
  - `accept-datetime`
  - `accept-language`
  - `referer`
  - `user-agent`
- Headers that re-implement cache or proxy features
  - `connection`
  - `content-length`
  - `cache-control`
  - `if-match`
  - `if-modified-since`
  - `if-none-match`
  - `if-unmodified-since`
  - `range`
  - `upgrade`
- Headers that are covered by other Cache Key features
  - `cookie`
  - `host`
- Headers that are specific to Cloudflare and prefixed with `cf-`, e.g. `cf-ray`
- Headers that are already included in the custom Cache Key template, e.g. `origin`

### Host

Host determines which host header to include in the Cache Key.
- If `resolved: false`, Cloudflare includes the `Host` header in the HTTP request sent to the origin.
- If `resolved: true`, Cloudflare includes the `Host` header that was resolved to get the `origin IP` for the request. In this scenario, the `Host` header may be different from the header actually sent if the [Cloudflare Resolve Override](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/206190798) feature is used.

### Cookie

Like `query_string` or `header`, `cookie` controls which cookies appear in the Cache Key. You can either include the cookie value or check for the presence of a particular cookie.

#### Usage notes

You cannot include cookies specific to Cloudflare. Cloudflare cookies are prefixed with `__cf`, e.g. `__cflb`

#### User features

User feature fields add features about the end-user (client) into the Cache Key. 
- `device_type` classifies a request as `mobile`, `desktop`, or `tablet` based on the User Agent
- `geo` includes the clientâ€™s country, derived from the IP address
- `lang` includes the first language code contained in the `Accept-Language` header sent by the client
