# Enable Tiered Cache

1.  Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your domain.
2.  Select **Caching** > **Tiered Cache**.
3.  From **Argo Tiered Cache**, toggle the button to **enabled**.

After enabling Tiered Cache, you are automatically enrolled in Smart Tiered Cache.

## Smart Tiered Cache

Smart Tiered Cache dynamically selects the single best upper tier for each of your websiteâ€™s origins with no configuration required, using our in-house performance and routing data. Cloudflare collects latency data for each request to an origin, and uses the latency data to determine how well any upper-tier data center is connected with an origin. As a result, Cloudflare can select the best data center with the lowest latency to be the upper-tier for an origin.

## Bandwidth Alliance may interrupt Tiered Cache
