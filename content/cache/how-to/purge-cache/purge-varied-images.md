# Purge varied images

Purging varied images purges all content variants for that URL. This behavior occurs so that if an image changes, you can easily update the cache with a single purge request instead of trying to determine the potential number of out-of-date variants. The behavior is true regardless of purge type used, such as single file, tag, or hostname.
