# Purge cache

Cloudflare offers different options to purge your content. Although single-file cache purging (purge by URL) is recommended, the following options are also available:

{{<directory-listing>}}

{{<feature-table id="cache.purge_cache">}}

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}

Purge requests appear in Cloudflare Logs and are identified by the `PURGE` method and the Cloudflare-branded User Agent.
