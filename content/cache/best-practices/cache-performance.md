# Cache performance

## Optimize cache ratios

Depending on the cache status you receive, you can make modifications to improve your cache ratio. To review the list of cache statuses, refer to [Cloudflare cache responses](/about/default-cache-behavior#cloudflare-cache-responses).

- **Dynamic**: Default response for many file types including HTML. To cache additional content, refer to [custom caching with page rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360021023712).
- **Revalidated**: To address an abnormal quantity of revalidated content, consider [increasing your Edge Cache TTLs](/how-to/create-page-rules) via a Page Rule or [max-age origin directive](/about/cache-control#cache-control-directives).
- **Expired**: Consider [extending Edge Cache TTLs](/how-to/create-page-rules) for these resources via a Page Rule or enable revalidation at your origin.
- **Miss**: Although tricky to optimize, there are a few potential remedies:
   - [Enable Argo Tiered Caching](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000224552) to check cache in another Cloudflare data center before checking the origin web server.
   - [Create a custom cache key](/about/cache-keys) for multiple URLs to match the same cached resource, for example by ignoring query string.

## Example reports for troubleshooting cache performance
 
Several examples of helpful insights into your site performance via Cache Analytics include:

- Not caching HTML.
   - Identify the issue: Click **Add filter** and select **Cache status equals Dynamic**. 
   - Resolution: Set a Cloudflare Page Rule to [cache dynamic content](/best-practices/customize-cache).

- Short cache expiration TTL.
   - Identify the issue: Click **Add filter** and select **Cache status equals Revalidated**. 
   - Resolution: [Increase Cloudflareâ€™s Edge Cache TTL via a Page Rule](/about/edge-browser-cache-ttl).

- Need to enable Tiered Cache or Custom Cache Key 
  - Identify the issue: Click **Add filter** and select **Cache status equals Miss**. 
  - Resolution: Enable Argo Tiered Caching or [create a custom cache key](/about/cache-keys).
