## Reference Architectures

Explore the following Reference Architectures that use KV.

* [A/B-testing using Workers](/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/a-b-testing-using-workers/): Use KV to build an A/B testing architecture, where KV is used to store the routing information to the proper origin service based on the incoming request.
* [Fullstack web applications](/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/): Use KV within your fullstack web applications as a data store for read-heavy workloads.
* [Serverless global APIs](/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-global-apis/): Use KV within your global serverless APIs as a data store for read-heavy workloads.
* [Serverless image content management platform](/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-image-content-management/): Use KV within your serverless image content management system to store image metadata.
