# Environments

KV namespaces can be used with [environments](/workers/wrangler/environments/#environments). This is useful when you have code in your Worker that refers to a KV binding like `MY_KV`, and you want to have these bindings point to different KV namespaces (for example, one for staging and one for production).

The following code in the `wrangler.toml` file shows you how to have two environments that have two different KV namespaces but the same binding name:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[env.staging]
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "MY_KV", id = "e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8" }
]

[env.production]
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "MY_KV", id = "a825455ce00f4f7282403da85269f8ea" }
]
```
Using the same binding name for two different KV namespaces keeps your Worker code more readable. 

In the `staging` environment, `MY_KV.get("KEY")` will read from the namespace ID `e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8`. In the `production` environment, `MY_KV.get("KEY")` will read from the namespace ID `a825455ce00f4f7282403da85269f8ea`.

To insert a value into a `staging` KV namespace, run:

```sh
$ wrangler kv key put --env=staging --binding=<YOUR_BINDING> "<KEY>" "<VALUE>"
```

Since `--namespace-id` is always unique (unlike binding names), you do not need to specify an `--env` argument:

```sh
$ wrangler kv key put --namespace-id=<YOUR_ID> "<KEY>" "<VALUE>"
```

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Since version 3.60.0, Wrangler KV commands support the `kv ...` syntax. If you are using versions of Wrangler below 3.60.0, the command follows the `kv:...` syntax. Learn more about the deprecation of the `kv:...` syntax in the [Wrangler commands](/kv/reference/kv-commands/) for KV page.

Most `kv` subcommands also allow you to specify an environment with the optional `--env` flag. 

Specifying an environment with the optional `--env` flag  allows you to publish Workers running the same code but with different KV namespaces. 

For example, you could use separate staging and production KV namespaces for KV data in your `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
type = "webpack"
name = "my-worker"
account_id = "<account id here>"
route = "staging.example.com/*"
workers_dev = false

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "MY_KV", id = "06779da6940b431db6e566b4846d64db" }
]

[env.production]
route = "example.com/*"
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "MY_KV", id = "07bc1f3d1f2a4fd8a45a7e026e2681c6" }
]
```

With the `wrangler.toml` file above, you can specify `--env production` when you want to perform a KV action on the KV namespace `MY_KV` under `env.production`. 

For example, with the `wrangler.toml` file above, you can get a value out of a production KV instance with:

```sh
$ wrangler kv key get --binding "MY_KV" --env=production "<KEY>"
```
