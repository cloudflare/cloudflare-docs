# KV bindings

KV [bindings](/workers/configuration/bindings/) allow for communication between a Worker and a KV namespace. 

Configure KV bindings in the [wrangler.toml file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#configure-wranglertoml). 

## Reference KV from Workers

A [KV namespace](/kv/reference/kv-namespaces/) is a key-value database replicated to Cloudflare's global network. 

To connect to a KV namespace from within a Worker, you must define a binding that points to the namespace's ID.

The name of your binding does not need to match the KV namespace's name. Instead, the binding should be a valid JavaScript identifier, because the identifier will exist as a global variable within your Worker.

A KV namespace will have a name you choose (for example, `My tasks`), and an assigned ID (for example, `06779da6940b431db6e566b4846d64db`).

To execute your Worker, define the binding. 

In the following example, the binding is called `TODO`. In the `kv_namespaces` portion of your `wrangler.toml` file, add:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "worker"

# ...

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "TODO", id = "06779da6940b431db6e566b4846d64db" }
]
```

With this, the deployed Worker will have a `TODO` field in their environment object (the second parameter of the `fetch()` request handler). Any methods on the `TODO` binding will map to the KV namespace with an ID of `06779da6940b431db6e566b4846d64db` â€“ which you called `My Tasks` earlier.


```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Get the value for the "to-do:123" key
    // NOTE: Relies on the `TODO` KV binding that maps to the "My Tasks" namespace.
    let value = await env.TODO.get("to-do:123");

    // Return the value, as is, for the Response
    return new Response(value);
  },
};
```

## Reference KV from Durable Objects and Workers using ES modules format

[Durable Objects](/durable-objects/) use ES modules format. Instead of a global variable, bindings are available as properties of the `env` parameter [passed to the constructor](/durable-objects/get-started/#3-write-a-class-to-define-a-durable-object). 

An example might look like:

```js
export class DurableObject {
  constructor(state, env) {
    this.state = state;
    this.env = env;
  }

  async fetch(request) {
    const valueFromKV = await this.env.NAMESPACE.get("someKey");
    return new Response(valueFromKV);
  }
}
```
