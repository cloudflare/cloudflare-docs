By default, WARP excludes traffic bound for RFC 1918 space as part of its [Split Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/) feature. For example, WARP automatically excludes `10.0.0.0/8`, which are IP addresses typically used in private networks and not reachable from the Internet. In order for WARP to send traffic to your private network, the IP/CIDR that you specified for your tunnel must be included in your Split Tunnel configuration.

To configure Split Tunnels for private network access:

1. First, check whether your [Split Tunnels mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/) is set to **Exclude** or **Include** mode.
2. If you are using **Include** mode, add your network's IP/CIDR range to the list.
3. If you are using **Exclude** mode:
   1. Delete your network's IP/CIDR range from the list. For example, if your network uses the default AWS range of `172.31.0.0/16`, delete `172.16.0.0/12`.
   2. Re-add IP/CDIR ranges that are not explicitly used by your private network. For the AWS example above, you would add new entries for `172.16.0.0/13`, `172.24.0.0/14`, `172.28.0.0/15`, and `172.30.0.0/16`. This ensures that that only traffic to `172.31.0.0/16` routes through WARP.

By tightening the private IP range included in WARP, you reduce the risk of breaking a user's access to local resources.
