Cloudflare Access allows you to securely publish internal tools and applications to the Internet by providing an authentication layer between the end user and your origin server. You can use signals from your existing identity providers (IdPs), device posture providers, and [other rules](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/#selectors) to control who can access your application.
