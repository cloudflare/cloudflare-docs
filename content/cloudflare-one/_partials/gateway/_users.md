The **User**, **User Group**, and **SAML Attributes** selectors require Gateway with WARP mode to be enabled in the Zero Trust WARP client, and the user to be enrolled in the organization via the WARP client. For more information on identity-based selectors, refer to the [Identity-based policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/identity-selectors/) page.
