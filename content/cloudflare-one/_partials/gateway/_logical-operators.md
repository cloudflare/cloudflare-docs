<div class="special-class" markdown="1">

To evaluate multiple conditions in an expression, select the **Add** logical operator. These expressions can be compared further with the **Or** logical operator.

| Operator | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| And      | match all of the conditions in the expression |
| Or       | match any of the conditions in the expression |

The **Or** operator will only work with conditions in the same expression group. For example, you cannot compare conditions in **Traffic** with conditions in $1.
