DNS locations are usually physical entities like schools offices, homes, retail stores, movie theatres, or data centers. The fastest way to start filtering DNS queries from a location is by changing the DNS resolvers at the router.

To add a DNS location to Gateway:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Gateway** > **DNS Locations**.

2. Select **Add a location**.

3. Choose a name for your DNS location.

4. Cloudflare will prefill the [**Source IPv4 Address**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/dns-resolver-ips/#source-ip) based on the network you are on. Enterprise customers have the option of manually entering IPs.

   You do not need the IPv4 address field if:

   - Your DNS location only uses IPv6.
   - Users will be sending all DNS requests from this location using DNS over HTTPS via a browser.
   - You will be deploying the [WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/).

   If any of the above apply to your case, select **Delete**.

When trying to configure a DNS location over IPv4, you may run into a **Your source IPv4 address is taken** error.

This may mean someone else in the same network signed up for Cloudflare Gateway before you did. If your network supports IPv6, you can still use Cloudflare Gateway's DNS filtering by sending DNS queries over IPv6. You can also use the DNS over HTTPS hostname to send queries using a DNS over HTTPS client.

If you think someone else is wrongfully using this IPv4 address, [let us know](https://forms.gle/o9dLMjmCg6QtaDJ88).

5. (Optional) Toggle the following settings:

   - **Set as Default DNS Location** sets this location as the default DoH endpoint for DNS queries.
   - **Enable EDNS client subnet** sends a user's IP geolocation to authoritative DNS nameservers.

     [EDNS client subnet (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDNS_Client_Subnet) helps reduce latency by routing the user to the closest origin server. Cloudflare has enabled EDNS in a privacy preserving way by not sending the user's exact IP address but rather a /24 range which contains their IP address.

6. Select **Add location**.
