You can create a list by:

- [Uploading a list of entries](#create-a-list-from-a-csv-file)
- [Manually creating a list of entries](#create-a-manual-list)

## Create a list from a CSV file

Here is a [sample CSV file](/cloudflare-one/static/documentation/list-test.csv) of URLs that you can use for testing. When formatting the CSV:

- Each line should be a single entry.
- Trailing whitespaces are not allowed.
- CRLF (Windows) and LF (Unix) line endings are valid.

To upload the list to Zero Trust:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **My Team** > **Lists**.
2. Select **Upload CSV**.
3. Next, specify a **List name**, enter an optional description, and choose a **List type**.
4. Drag and drop a file into the **CSV file** window, or select a file.
5. Select **Create**.

You can now use this list in the policy builder by choosing the _in list_ operator.

## Create a manual list

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **My Team** > **Lists**.
2. Select **Create manual list**.
3. Next, specify a **List name**, enter an optional description, and choose a **List type**.
4. Enter your list element manually into the **Add entry** field and select **Add**.
5. Select **Save**.

You can now use this list in the policy builder by choosing the _in list_ operator.
