Gateway activity logs show the individual DNS queries, Network packets, and HTTP requests inspected by Gateway. You can also download encrypted [SSH command logs](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/network-policies/ssh-logging/) for sessions proxied by Gateway.

To view Gateway activity logs, log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Logs** > **Gateway**. Select an individual row to investigate the event in more detail.

Enterprise users can generate more detailed logs with [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/).
