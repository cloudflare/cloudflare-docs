- Content Categories: An upstream vendor supplies content categories for domains. These categories help us organize domains into broad topic areas. However, the specific criteria and methods used by our vendor may not be disclosed.
- Security Risks: We determine security risks for domains using our internal models. These models analyze various factors, including the age of a domain and its reputation. This allows us to identify potentially risky domains.
- Security Threats: To identify malicious domains that pose security threats, we employ a mix of internal data sources, machine learning models, commercial feeds, and open-source threat intelligence.
