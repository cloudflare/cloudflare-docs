The following procedure makes two changes to the `sshd_config` file on the remote target machine. The first change requires that you uncomment a field already set in most default configurations; the second change adds a new field.

1. While staying within the `/etc/ssh` directory on the remote machine, open the `sshd_config` file.

    ```sh
    $ vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

2. Navigate to the row named `PubkeyAuthentication`. In most default configurations, the row will appear commented out as follows:

    ```bash
    # PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ```

3. Remove the # symbol to uncomment the line; keep the setting `yes` enabled.

4. Next, add a new line below `PubkeyAuthentication` as follows:

    ```bash
    TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub
    ```

    Save the file and quit the editor. You might need to use the following command again to save and exit.

    ```bash
    :w !sudo tee %
    :q!
    ```
