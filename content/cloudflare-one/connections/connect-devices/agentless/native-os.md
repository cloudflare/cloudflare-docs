# Native OS

{{<Aside type="Warning" header="Warning">}}

Enrolling devices using static IP addresses may prevent users from connecting to some of the public Wi-Fi networks that use captive portals. If users are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals, they should:

1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device.
1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
1. Once the connection has been established, add the static IP addresses back.

Alternatively, you can look into using the [WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/) to connect your devices to Cloudflare Zero Trust.
