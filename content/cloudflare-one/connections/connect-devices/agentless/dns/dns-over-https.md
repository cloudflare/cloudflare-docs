# Configure DNS over HTTPS

With Cloudflare Gateway, you can filter DNS over HTTPS (DoH) requests by [DNS location](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/) or by user without needing to install the WARP client on your devices.

Location-based policies require that you send DNS requests to a [location-specific DoH endpoint](#filter-doh-requests-by-location), while identity-based policies require that requests include a [user-specific DoH token](#filter-doh-requests-by-user).

## Filter DoH requests by location

Location-based policies require that you send DNS requests to a unique [DoH endpoint](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#doh-subdomain) assigned to the location:

```txt
https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query
```

### Prerequisites

Obtain your location's [DoH subdomain](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#doh-subdomain).

### Configure browser for DoH

Browsers can be configured to use any DNS over HTTPS (DoH) endpoint. If you choose to configure DoH directly in your browser, you must choose a Gateway DNS location as your DoH endpoint, otherwise DNS filtering will not occur in that browser.

3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select **Enable DNS over HTTPS**.
5. In the **Use Provider** drop-down menu, select _Custom_.
6. In the **Custom** field, enter `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.
7. Select **OK**.
8. Enter **about:config** in the address bar.
9. Select **Accept the risk!** if you see a prompt from Firefox.
10. Set **network.trr.bootstrapAddress** to `162.159.36.5`.
11. Set **network.trr.mode** to `3`.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you want to disable DoH for your organization so that Gateway can be enforced, create a policy to block [this canary domain](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/canary-domain-use-application-dnsnet).

Your DNS queries will now be sent to Gateway for filtering. To filter these requests, build a DNS policy using the [**DNS Location**](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/dns-policies/#dns-location) selector.

## Filter DoH requests by user

In order to filter DoH queries based on user identity, each query must include a user-specific authentication token. If you have several devices per user and want to apply device-specific policies, you will need to map each device to a different email.

Currently, authentication tokens can only be generated through the API. You can run this [interactive Python script](/cloudflare-one/static/documentation/connections/authenticated-doh.py) which automates the setup procedure, or follow the steps described below.

### 1. Create a service token for the account

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/access/service_tokens" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"name":"ACME Corporation service token"}'
```

Save the service token's `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `id`.

{
  "result": {
    "client_id": "88bf3b6d86161464f6509f7219099e57.access",
    "client_secret": "bdd31cbc4dec990953e39163fbbb194c93313ca9f0a6e420346af9d326b1d2a5",
    "created_at": "2022-06-09T01:59:17Z",
    "expires_at": "2023-06-09T01:59:17Z",
    "id": "f174e90a-fafe-4643-bbbc-4a0ed4fc8415",
    "name": "ACME Corporation service token",
    "updated_at": "2022-06-09T01:59:17Z"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

</div>
</details>

### 2. Enable DoH functionality for the service token

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/access/organizations/doh/<ID>" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

If you get an `access.api.error.service_token_not_found` error,  check that `<SERVICE_TOKEN_ID>` is the value of `id` and not `client_id`.

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
<div>

```bash
{
  "result": {
    "client_id": "88bf3b6d86161464f6509f7219099e57.access",
    "created_at": "2022-06-09T01:59:17Z",
    "expires_at": "2023-06-09T01:59:17Z",
    "id": "f174e90a-fafe-4643-bbbc-4a0ed4fc8415",
    "name": "ACME Corporation service token",
    "updated_at": "2022-06-09T01:59:17Z",
    "duration": "8760h"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

</div>
</details>

### 3. Create a user

Create a new user and optionally add them to a group.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/access/users" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{
        "name":"John Doe",
        "email":"jdoe@acme.com",
        "custom": {"groups":[{"id": "02fk6b3p3majl10", "email": "finance@acme.com", "name": "Finance"}]}
        }'
```

Save the user's `id` returned in the response.

<summary>Example response</summary>

{
  "result": {
    "id": "54d425de-7a78-4186-9975-d43c88ee7899",
    "created_at": "2022-03-16T21:18:39.93598Z",
    "updated_at": "2022-05-17T23:50:39.598345Z",
    "uid": "54d425de-7a78-4186-9975-d43c88ee7899",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "jdoe@acme.com",
    "custom": {
        "groups": [
            {
                "email": "finance@acme.com",
                "id": "02fk6b3p3majl10",
                "name": "Finance"
            }
        ]
    }
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

</div>
</details>

Steps 1-3 above only need to be completed once, while Steps 4-5 below would occur during normal operation.

### 4. Generate a DoH token for the user

Request a DoH token for the user, using your service token to authenticate into your [team domain](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#team-domain).

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://<TEAM_NAME>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/doh-token?account-id=<ACCOUNT_ID>&user-id=<USER_ID>&auth-domain=<TEAM_NAME>.cloudflareaccess.com" \
     -H "Cf-Access-Client-Id: <CLIENT_ID>" \
     -H "Cf-Access-Client-Secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>"
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

The response contains a unique DoH token associated with the user. This token expires in 24 hours. We recommend setting up a refresh flow for the DoH token instead of generating a new one for every DoH query.

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
<div>

```bash
{"token":"y2khbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImJlZjVkYjg4ZTEwMjk3ZDEwNzhkMmEyYjE0MjMxZTljYTQwMjQ2NjAwOTQzNmJhOTQwOGJkODY3ZmI4OWFiOGQifQ.eyJ0eXBlIjoiZG9oIiwiYXVkIjoiY2xvdWRmbGFyZS1nYXRld2F5LmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDc1MTg3NSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0ODM4Mjc1LCJhY2NvdW50LWlkIjoiMTA4MDM0OGIyZGYzYmQwN2QxZmI1MjM3Y2Q1ZDU5M2EiLCJ1c2VyLWlkIjoiNTRkNDI1ZGUtN2E3OC00MTg2LTk5NzUtZDQzYzg4ZWU3ODk5In0.I5p4WsH2dPhQ8vwy84zF05PsoBHCsUSXAaMpNhEH36oFZ3tXcs9ksLz7OzpZ_x3HxUfO3n57LlpAF1VehaBt2i94XCkvSgtHpYcwd_qZydLp-BGtcyfU1LbdXQC3m6zxKcIWu5VySi8I-J25UYlpyJhYgZ4DQUZIpqbSSt6WcVRKvA7OBa7xjkTux4OcqWAViO_ZS-GLwl-fqhvolmiwk37seBD3YuV1zG06VeWXfrMkZ5MbhooHD1DZDBHOZpTtmN8MbeKeI4tlY1mb_O3-jE-um6F9Hrl4NQm89MKFzsum-_Rywi5m4PTSlDza7fjdJs7RzFgJd3VWgzG-jgyQKw"}%
```

</div>
</details>

### 5. Send an authenticated DoH query

Send DoH queries to the resolver at `https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`, making sure to include the user's DoH token in the `CF-Authorization` header.

```bash
curl -s 'https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query?name=example.com' \
     -H 'accept: application/dns-json' \
     -H 'CF-Authorization: <USER_DOH_TOKEN>' | jq
```

If the site is blocked and you have enabled [**Display block page**](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/configuring-block-page/#enable-the-block-page-for-dns-policies) for the policy, the query will return `162.159.36.12` (the IP address of the Gateway block page). If the block page is disabled, the response will be `0.0.0.0`.

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
<div>

```bash
{
  "Status": 0,
  "TC": false,
  "RD": true,
  "RA": true,
  "AD": false,
  "CD": false,
  "Question": [
    {
      "name": "example.com",
      "type": 1
    }
  ],
  "Answer": [
    {
      "name": "example.com",
      "type": 1,
      "TTL": 60,
      "data": "162.159.36.12"
    }
  ]
}
```

</div>
</details>

You can verify that the request was associated with the correct user email by checking your [Gateway DNS logs](/cloudflare-one/analytics/logs/gateway-logs/). To filter these requests, build a DNS policy using any of the Gateway [identity-based selectors](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/identity-selectors/).
