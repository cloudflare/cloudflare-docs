# Agentless options

If you are unable to install the WARP client on your devices (for example, Windows Server does not support the WARP client), you can use agentless options to perform a subset of Gateway functions.

- **[DNS filtering](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/)** without WARP requires changing your local DNS resolver to Cloudflare.
- **[HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/pac-files/)** without WARP requires configuring your browser to forward traffic to a Cloudflare proxy server.
