# WARP settings

This page describes the WARP configuration options available on the Zero Trust dashboard. To configure these settings, open the [Zero Trust dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com) and go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Managed deployments">}}
If you are deploying [WARP with device management software](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/), we recommend only supplying `organization` in your [deployment parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/parameters/) and managing all other settings via the dashboard. Any settings you configure on the dashboard will be overridden by the local policy deployed by your management software. To ensure dashboard settings are applied as intended, remove the corresponding parameters from your managed deployment configuration.

This feature needs the <b>Lock WARP switch</b> feature to be set to <b>True</b>. You can enable the feature via MDM or under <b>Settings</b> > <b>Devices</b> on the Zero Trust Dashboard.

{{</Aside>}}

When this toggle is **enabled**, you can provide end users with an one-time password that will allow them to toggle off the WARP client in case they need to work around a temporary network issue (for example, an incompatible public Wi-Fi, or a firewall at a customer site blocking the connection).

When the toggle is **disabled**, one-time passwords will not be generated, and end users will not be able to toggle the client off when \*_Switch Locked_ is true.

You can also set a timeout to define how long the WARP client is allowed to be paused once the end user disables it. Once the time is up, the WARP client will automatically reconnect.

When you want to allow a user to disable the WARP client:

1.  Log in to the Zero Trust Dashboard and ensure the **Admin override** toggle is enabled.
1.  Retrieve the 7-digit override code for their device by navigating to **My Team** > **Devices** > **Connected devices**, clicking on **View** for the desired device, and scrolling down to **User details**.
1.  Copy the code and share it with the end user for them to enter on their device.

Users will then need to open the WARP client on their devices, navigate to **Preferences** > **Advanced** > **Enter code**, and enter the override code in the pop-up window. The WARP client will now show as `Disconnected` and will mention the time when it will automatically reconnect.

Cloudflare Zero Trust allows you to establish which users in your organization can enroll new devices or revoke access to connected devices. To do that, you can create a device enrollment rule on the Zero Trust dashboard:

1.  Navigate to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
1.  In the **Device enrollment permissions** card, click **Manage**.
1.  In the rule builder, configure one or more rules to define who can enroll or revoke devices.
1.  Click **Save**.

Captive Portal detection is the ability for the WARP client to detect a third-party onboarding flow before Internet access is obtained. This is most frequent in places such as airports, cafes, and hotels.

When the toggle is enabled, the WARP client will automatically turn off when it detects a captive portal, and it will automatically turn on after the amount of time you specify in the card.

## Mode switch

When the toggle is enabled, users have the option to switch between [Gateway with WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/#gateway-with-warp-default) mode and [Gateway with DoH mode](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/#gateway-with-doh). When the toggle is disabled, end users will not be able to switch between modes.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

  This feature only allow switching between <b>Gateway with WARP</b> and <b>Gateway with DoH</b>. It does not support any other modes.

## Lock WARP switch

Allows the user to turn off the WARP switch and disconnect the client.

**Value:**

- `Disabled` &mdash; (default) The user is able to turn the switch on/off at their discretion. When the switch is off, the user will not have the ability to reach sites protected by Access that leverage certain device posture checks.
- `Enabled` &mdash; The user is prevented from turning off the switch. The WARP Agent will start in the connected state when this is enabled.

On new deployments, you must also include the `auto_connect` parameter with at least a value of `0`. This will prevent clients from being deployed in the off state without a way for users to manually enable them.


## Allow device to leave organization

</div>
</details>

When the toggle is enabled, users who manually logged in to their organization on WARP are prevented from leaving that organization. This disables the **Logout from Zero Trust** and **Reset All Settings** button in the WARP client interface. If the WARP client has been deployed with a management tool and a local policy exists, then this switch is bypassed and clients are always prevented from leaving.

## Allow updates

When the toggle is enabled, users will receive update notifications when a new version of the client is available. Only turn this on if your users are local administrators with the ability to add/remove software from their device.

## Auto connect

When the toggle is enabled, the client will automatically reconnect if it has been disabled for the specified Timeout value. This setting is best used in conjunction with [Lock WARP Switch](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/warp-settings/#lock-warp-switch) above.

We recommend keeping this set to a very low value &mdash; usually just enough time for a user to log in to hotel or airport WiFi. If any value is specified, the default state the app will always be Connected (ex. after reboot, after initial install, etc.)

**Value:**

- `0` &mdash; Allow the switch to stay in the off position indefinitely until the user turns it back on.
- `1` to `1440` &mdash; Turn switch back on automatically after the specified number of minutes.

When the toggle is enabled, the **Send Feedback** button in the WARP client appears and will launch the URL specified. Example **Support URL** values are:

- `https://support.example.com` Use an https:// link to open your companies internal help site.
- `mailto:yoursupport@example.com` Use a mailto: link to open your default mail client.

Allows you to choose the operational mode of the client. See [WARP Modes](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/#warp-client-modes) for a detailed description of each mode.

- **Gateway with WARP** DNS and Device traffic is encrypted and processed by Gateway. This mode is required if you want to enable HTTP rules, Browser Isolation, Anti-Virus scanning and DLP.
- **Gateway with DoH** Enforcement of DNS policies only through DoH. All other traffic is handled by default mechanisms on your devices.
- **Proxy Only** Only traffic sent to the localhost proxy is encrypted by Gateway. This mode does not process DNS traffic.

## Session duration

You can require users to re-authenticate their device after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Unlike the other WARP settings listed on this page, session durations are managed through a Gateway policy. Refer to [WARP session duration](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/enforce-sessions/) for more information.
