    Write-Host 'Downloading App from' $url
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $filename

    <# Run the installer and wait for the installation to finish #>
    $arguments = "ORGANIZATION="exampleorg" SERVICE_MODE="warp" GATEWAY_UNIQUE_ID="fmxk762nrj" SUPPORT_URL="http://support.example.com""

    $installProcess = (Start-Process $filename -ArgumentList $arguments -PassThru -Wait)

    <# Check if installation was successful #>
    if ($installProcess.ExitCode -ne 0) {
        Write-Host "Installation failed!"
        exit $installProcess.ExitCode
    }
