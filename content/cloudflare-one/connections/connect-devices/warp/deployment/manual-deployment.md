# Manual deployment

If you plan to direct your users to manually download and configure the WARP client, users will need to connect the client to your organization's Cloudflare Zero Trust instance.

## Prerequisites

- [Install the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/) on user devices.

## Set device enrollment permissions

To specify which users in your organization can enroll new devices:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. In the **Device enrollment** card, select **Manage**.
3. In the **Rules** tab, configure one or more [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to define who can enroll or revoke devices.
4. In the **Authentication** tab, select the [identity providers](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/) users can authenticate with.
5. Choose a global **Session duration** for enrolled devices. Users will need to re-authenticate their device after their session expires. To customize session durations for different users or applications, refer to [session duration policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/enforce-sessions/).
6. Select **Save**.

Your device enrollment rules are now active. To see which devices have been enrolled or revoked, go to **My Team** > **Devices**.
