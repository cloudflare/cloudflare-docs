# Device enrollment permissions

Device enrollment permissions determine which users can connect new devices to your organization's Cloudflare Zero Trust instance.

## Set device enrollment permissions

{{<render file="warp/_device-enrollment.md">}}

Users can now [enroll their device](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) by logging in to your identity provider. To prevent users from logging out of your organization after they enroll, disable [Allow devices to leave organization](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/#allow-device-to-leave-organization) in your WARP client settings.

## Example policies

### Check for service token

Instead of requiring users to authenticate with their credentials, you can use a [service token](/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/) to enroll devices without any user interaction. Because users are not required to log in to an identity provider, identity-based policies cannot be enforced on these devices.

To enroll devices using a service token:

{{<render file="warp/_service-token-enrollment.md">}}

You can verify which devices have enrolled by going to **My Team** > **Devices**. Devices that enrolled using a service token (or any other Service Auth policy) will have the **Email** field show as `non_identity@<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`.

### Check for mTLS certificate

Enterprise customers can enforce [mutual TLS authentication](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/) during device enrollment.

To check for an mTLS certificate:

1. [Add an mTLS certificate](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#add-mtls-authentication-to-your-access-configuration) to your account. You can generate a sample certificate using the [Cloudflare PKI toolkit](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-mtls-using-cloudflare-pki).

2. In **Associated hostnames**, enter your Zero Trust {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="team domain">}}team domain{{</glossary-tooltip>}}: `<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`
3. In your [device enrollment permissions](#set-device-enrollment-permissions), add a _Common Name_ or _Valid Certificate_ rule. For example, the following policy requires a client certificate with a specific common name:

    | Action   | Rule type | Selector    | Value                 |
    | -------- | --------- | ------------| --------------------- |
    | Allow    | Require   | Common Name |  `<CERT-COMMON-NAME>` |

4. On your device, add the client certificate to the [system keychain](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/access-integrations/mutual-tls-authentication/#test-in-the-browser).

When users [log in to your Zero Trust organization](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/) from the WARP client, their device must present a valid client certificate in order to connect.
