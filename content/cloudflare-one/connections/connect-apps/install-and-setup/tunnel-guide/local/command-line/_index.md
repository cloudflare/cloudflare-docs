# Command line interface

Cloudflared Tunnel runs by deploying a `cloudflared` connector on your machine. Tunnels can be managed and created through the CLI.

You can use these [commands](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/command-line/tunnel-useful-commands/) the CLI

You can fine-tune how your tunnel operates by adding one or more [configuration flags](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/command-line/arguments/) to the `cloudflared` run command.
