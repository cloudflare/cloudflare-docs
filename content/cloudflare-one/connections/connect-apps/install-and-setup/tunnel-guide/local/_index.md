# Set up a tunnel locally

Follow this step-by-step guide to get your first tunnel up and running using the CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

* [Add a website to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/).
* [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708).

## 1. Download and install `cloudflared`

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>
<div>

First, download `cloudflared` on your machine. Visit the [downloads](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/) page to find the right package for your OS.

Next, rename the executable to `cloudflared.exe`, and then open PowerShell. Change directory to your Downloads folder and run `.\cloudflared.exe --version`. It should output the version of `cloudflared`. Note that `cloudflared.exe` could be `cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe` or `cloudflared-windows-386.exe` if you haven't renamed it.

Replace the path in the example with the specifics of your Downloads directory:

```text
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\cloudflared-stable-windows-amd64> .\cloudflared.exe --version
```

The first step to creating a tunnel is to download and install `cloudflared` on your machine.

```sh
$ brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Alternatively, you can [download the latest Darwin amd64 release](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/) directly.

<summary>Linux</summary>
<div>

First, download `cloudflared` on your machine. Visit the [downloads](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/) page to find the right package for your OS.

Next, install `cloudflared`.

### .deb install

Use the deb package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines. `amd64 / x86-64` is used in this example.

```sh
$ wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb && dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
```

### ​.rpm install

Use the rpm package manager to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines. `amd64 / x86-64` is used in this example.

```sh
$ wget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-x86_64.rpm
```

### Arch Linux

`cloudflared` is in the Arch Linux [`community` repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/official_repositories#community).
Use `pacman` to install `cloudflared` on compatible machines.

```sh
$ pacman -Syu cloudflared
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>
<div>

You can also build the latest version of `cloudflared` from source with the following steps.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared.git
$ cd cloudflared
$ make cloudflared
$ go install github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/cmd/cloudflared
```

Depending on where you installed `cloudflared`, you can move it to a known path as well.

```sh
$ mv /root/cloudflared/cloudflared /usr/bin/cloudflared
```

</div>
</details>

## 2. Authenticate `cloudflared`

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel login
```

Running this command will:

- Open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Cloudflare account. After logging in to your account, select your hostname.
- Generate an account certificate, the [cert.pem file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#certpem), in the [default `cloudflared` directory](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#default-cloudflared-directory).

## 3. Create a tunnel and give it a name

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>
```

Running this command will:

- Create a tunnel by establishing a persistent relationship between the [name you provide](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#tunnel-name) and a [UUID](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#tunnel-uuid) for your tunnel. At this point, no connection is active within the tunnel yet.
- Generate a [tunnel credentials file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#credentials-file) in the [default `cloudflared` directory](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#default-cloudflared-directory).
- Create a subdomain of `.cfargotunnel.com`.

From the output of the command, take note of the tunnel’s UUID and the path to your tunnel’s credentials file.

Confirm that the tunnel has been successfully created by running:

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel list
```

## 4. Create a configuration file

Create a [configuration file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#configuration-file) in your `.cloudflared` directory using any text editor. This file will configure the tunnel to route traffic from a given origin to the hostname of your choice. 

Add the following fields to the file:

**If you are connecting an application**

```txt
url: http://localhost:8000
tunnel: <Tunnel-UUID>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<Tunnel-UUID>.json
```

**If you are connecting a network**

```txt
tunnel: <Tunnel-UUID>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<Tunnel-UUID>.json
warp-routing:
  enabled: true
```

Confirm that the configuration file has been successfully created by running:

```sh
$ cat config.yml
```

## 5. Start routing traffic

Now assign a CNAME record that points traffic to your tunnel subdomain.

**If you are connecting an application**

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel route dns <UUID or NAME> <hostname>
```

**If you are connecting a network**

Add the IP/CIDR you would like to be routed through the tunnel.

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel route ip add <IP/CIDR> <UUID or NAME>
```

You can confirm that the route has been successfully established by running:

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel route ip show
```

## 6. Run the tunnel

Run the tunnel to proxy incoming traffic from the tunnel to any number of services running locally on your origin.

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel run <UUID or NAME>
```

If your configuration file has a custom name or is not in the `.cloudflared` directory, add the `--config` flag and specify the path.  

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel --config /path/your-config-file.yaml run
```

{{<Aside>}}

Cloudflare Tunnel can install itself as a system service on Linux and Windows and as a launch agent on macOS. For more information, refer to [Run as a service](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/as-a-service/).

## 7. Check the tunnel

Your tunnel configuration is complete! If you want to get information on the tunnel you just created, you can run:

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel info <UUID or NAME>
```
