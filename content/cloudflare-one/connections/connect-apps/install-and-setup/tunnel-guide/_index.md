# Set up your first tunnel

When setting up your first Cloudflare Tunnel, you have the option to create it:

* [Remotely on the Zero Trust dashboard](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/remote/#set-up-a-tunnel-remotely-dashboard-setup)
* [Locally, using your CLI](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/#set-up-a-tunnel-locally-cli-setup)
