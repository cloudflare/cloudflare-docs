# Configure tunnels

Cloudflared Tunnel runs by deploying a `cloudflared` connector on your machine. You can fine-tune how your tunnel operates by adding one or more [configuration flags](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/arguments/) to the `cloudflared` run command. The method for modifying `cloudflared` depends on how the tunnel was created:

If you set up your tunnel from the Zero Trust Dashboard, refer to the [Remote management](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/remote-management/) section.

If you set up your tunnel from the CLI, refer to the [Local management](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/local-management/) section.
