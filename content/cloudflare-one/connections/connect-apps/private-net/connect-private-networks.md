# Connect private networks

Creating a private network has two components: the server and the client. The server's infrastructure (whether that is a single application, multiple applications, or a network segment) is connected to Cloudflare's edge by Cloudflare Tunnel. This is done by running the cloudflared daemon on the server. Simply put, Cloudflare Tunnel is what connects your network to Cloudflare. On the client side, end users connects to Cloudflare's edge using the Cloudflare WARP agent.

To connect a private network to Cloudflareâ€™s edge, follow the guide below. You can also check out our [tutorial](/cloudflare-one/tutorials/warp-to-tunnel/).

## Prerequisites

- [Set up Gateway with WARP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/set-up-warp/#gateway-with-warp-default) on your devices.
- (Recommended) [Enable Gateway HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/initial-setup/http/) in the Zero Trust dashboard.

## 1. Create a tunnel

1. To create a tunnel, follow our [dashboard setup guide](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/remote/#1-create-a-tunnel). You can skip the connect an application step and go straight to connecting a network.

2. In the [Connect a network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/remote/#3-connect-a-network) step, enter the IP/CIDR range of your private network (for example `10.0.0.0/8`). This makes the WARP client aware that any requests to this IP range need to be routed to your new tunnel.

## 2. (Recommended) Route private network IPs through Gateway

By default, WARP automatically excludes some IP addresses from Gateway visibility as part of its [Split Tunnel feature](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/exclude-traffic/split-tunnels/). For example, WARP automatically excludes RFC 1918 IP addresses such as `10.0.0.0/8`, which are IP addresses typically used in private networks and not reachable from the Internet. You will need to make sure that traffic to the IP/CIDR you are associating with your private network are sent to Gateway for filtering.

To configure your Split Tunnel settings:

1. In the Zero Trust dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. Scroll down to **Split Tunnels** and note whether you have selected **Exclude** or **Include** mode.
3. Select **Manage**.
    - If you are using **Exclude** mode, the IP ranges you see listed are those that Cloudflare excludes from WARP encryption. If your network's IP/CIDR range is listed on this page, delete it.
    - If you are using **Include** mode, the IP ranges you see listed are the only ones Cloudflare is encrypting through WARP. Add your network's IP/CIDR range to the list.

## 3. (Recommended) Create Zero Trust policies

By default, only users enrolled in your Zero Trust organization can connect to your private network. You can create additional Zero Trust policies to manage access to specific applications.

1. Go to **Access** > **Applications** > **Add an application**.
2. Select **Private Network**.
3. Name your application.
4. For **Application type**, select _Destination IP_.
5. For **Value**, enter the IP address for your application (for example, `10.128.0.7`).
{{<Aside type="note">}}
If you would like to create a policy for an IP/CIDR range instead of a specific IP address, you can build a [Gateway Network policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/network-policies/) using the **Destination IP** selector.
{{</Aside>}}

6. Configure your [App Launcher](/cloudflare-one/applications/app-launcher/) visibility and logo.
7. Select **Next**. You will see two auto-generated Gateway Network policies: one that allows access to the destination IP and another that blocks access.
8. Modify the policies to include additional identity-based conditions. For example:

    - **Policy 1**
    | Action | Selector | Operator | Value |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | Allow  | Destination IP |in|`10.128.0.7` |
    |        |User email| Matches regex| `*@example.com`|

    - **Policy 2**
    | Block  | Selector | Operator | Value |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | Block |  Destination IP |in|`10.128.0.7` |

    Access rules are evaluated in order, so a user with an email ending in @example.com will be able to access `10.128.0.7` while all others will be blocked. For more information on building network policies, refer to our [dedicated documentation](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/network-policies/).

    If you enabled [Gateway HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/initial-setup/http/), you can also create [HTTP policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/) to fine-tune access to your application.

9. Select **Add application**.

Your application will appear on the **Applications** page.

## 4. Connect as a user

End users can now reach HTTP or TCP-based services on your network by navigating to any IP address in the range you have specified.

To check that their device is properly configured, the end user can visit `https://help.teams.cloudflare.com/` to ensure that:

- The page returns **Your network is fully protected**.
- In **HTTP filtering**, both **WARP** and **Gateway Proxy** are enabled.
- The **Team name** matches the Zero Trust organization from which you created the tunnel.
