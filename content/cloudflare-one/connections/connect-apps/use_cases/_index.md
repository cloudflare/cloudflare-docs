# Tunnel use cases
Cloudflare Tunnel creates a secure, outbound-only connection between your services and Cloudflare by deploying a lightweight connector in your environment. Here is how to use tunnels with some specific services:

- [SSH](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use_cases/ssh/)
- [RDP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use_cases/rdp/)
- [SMB](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/use_cases/smb/)
