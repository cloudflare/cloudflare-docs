# Public hostnames

With Cloudflare Tunnel, you can expose your HTTP resources to the Internet via a public hostname. For example, you can add a route that points `docs.example.com` to `localhost:8080`. Anyone can now view your local application by going to `docs.example.com` in their web browser.

Cloudflare can route traffic to your Cloudflare Tunnel connection using a [DNS record](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/dns/) or Cloudflareâ€™s [Load Balancer](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/routing-to-tunnel/lb/) product. You can configure either option from the Cloudflare dashboard by pointing a DNS CNAME record or a Load Balancer pool to the Cloudflare Tunnel subdomain for your connection. You can also associate these records with your Tunnel from `cloudflared` directly.

Cloudflare Tunnel can also be configured to route traffic to multiple hostnames to [multiple services](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/local-management/ingress/) in your environment.
