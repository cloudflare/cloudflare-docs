# Tunnel metrics

Tunnel metrics show a Cloudflare Tunnel's throughput and resource usage over time. When you run a tunnel, you can configure `cloudflared` to spin up a Prometheus metrics endpoint â€” an HTTP server that exposes metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) format. You can then use the Prometheus toolkit on a remote machine to scrape metrics data from the `cloudflared` server.

## Start the metrics server

Perform these steps on the `cloudflared` server.

1. Use the [--metrics](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-run-parameters/#metrics) flag to create a metrics endpoint at the specified IP address and port. Here is an example command for a locally-managed tunnel:
    ```sh
    $ cloudflared tunnel --metrics 127.0.0.1:60123 run my-tunnel
    ```

    To learn how to add the `--metrics` flag to a remotely-managed tunnel, refer to [Configure a remotely-managed tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/remote-management/#add-tunnel-run-parameters).

{{<Aside type="note">}}
If you plan to fetch metrics from another machine on the local network, you can replace `127.0.0.1` with the internal IP of the `cloudflared` server (for example, `198.168.x.x`). To serve metrics on all available network interfaces, use `0.0.0.0`.
{{</Aside>}}

2. Verify that the metrics server is running by going to `http://localhost:60123/metrics`. This will only work if you configured a localhost IP (`127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`).

You can now export the metrics to Prometheus and Grafana in order to visualize and query the data. Refer to our [tutorial](/cloudflare-one/tutorials/grafana/) for instructions on getting started with these tools.
