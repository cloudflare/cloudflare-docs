# Tunnel permissions

{{<render file="_cloudflared-new-ui.md">}}

Cloudflare Tunnel requires two files:

- An [account certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#certpem) (the `cert.pem`)
- A tunnel [credentials file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-useful-terms/#credentials-file) (`<TUNNEL-UUID>.json`) for each tunnel

The account certificate (`cert.pem`) gives power to manage Tunnels to the admin of the account for which it is issued. As an admin, make sure you are intentional about the locations and machines you store this certificate on, as this certificate allows users to create and manage any number of tunnels for that account.

Each `cloudflared tunnel create` command generates a tunnel credential. The tunnel credential only allows the user to run that specific tunnel, and do nothing else. Hence, as an admin, you can share tunnel credentials with the users that will run the tunnels.

Refer to the table below for a comparison between the two files and the purposes for which they are intended.

## Tunnel ownership

Tunnel ownership is bound to the Cloudflare account for which the `cert.pem` file was issued upon authenticating `cloudflared`. If a user in a Cloudflare account creates a tunnel, any other user in the same account who has access to the `cert.pem` file for the account can delete, list, or otherwise manage tunnels within it.
