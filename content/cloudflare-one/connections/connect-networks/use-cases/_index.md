# Tunnel use cases

Cloudflare Tunnel creates a secure, outbound-only connection between your services and Cloudflare by deploying a lightweight connector in your environment. Here is how to use tunnels with some specific services:

- [SSH](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/ssh/)
- [RDP](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/rdp/)
- [SMB](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/use-cases/smb/)
