# Set up a tunnel through the dashboard

Follow this step-by-step guide to get your first tunnel up and running using Zero Trust.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

- [Add a website to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/add-site/).
- [Change your domain nameservers to Cloudflare](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).

## 1. Create a tunnel

The next steps depend on whether you want to [connect an application](#2-connect-an-application) or [connect a network](#3-connect-a-network).

## 2. Connect an application

Follow these steps to connect an application through your tunnel. If you are looking to connect a network, skip to the [Connect a network section](#3-connect-a-network).

1. In the **Public Hostnames** tab, choose an application from the drop-down menu and specify any subdomain or path information.

2. Specify a service, for example `https://localhost:8000`.

3. Under **Additional application settings**, specify any [parameters](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/origin-configuration/) you would like to add to your tunnel configuration.

4. Select **Save `<tunnel-name>`**.

## 3. Connect a network

Follow these steps to connect a private network through your tunnel.

1. In the **Private Networks** tab, add an IP or CIDR.

2. Select **Save `<tunnel-name>`**.

## 4. View your tunnel

After saving the tunnel, you will be redirected to the **Tunnels** page. Look for your new tunnel to be listed along with its active connector.
