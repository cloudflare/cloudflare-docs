# Create a tunnel

To create and manage tunnels, you will need to install and authenticate {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="cloudflared">}}<code>cloudflared</code>{{</glossary-tooltip>}} on your origin server. `cloudflared` is what connects your server to Cloudflare's global network.

You have the option of creating a tunnel [via the dashboard](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) or [via the command line](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/). We recommend getting started with the dashboard, since it will allow you to manage the tunnel from any machine.
