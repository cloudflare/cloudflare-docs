# Configure block page

Gateway responds to any blocked domain with 0.0.0.0, and does not return that blocked domain's IP address. As a result, the browser will show a default error page, and users will not be able to reach that website. This may cause confusion and lead some users to think that their Internet is not working.

Configuring a custom block page in Zero Trust helps avoid this confusion. Your block page will display information such as the rule ID of the policy blocking the website, a policy-specific block message, your organization's name, and a global message you may want to show — for example, a message explaining that the website has been blocked by Gateway and providing any points of contact for support within the organization.

## Prerequisites

In order to display the block page as the URL of the blocked domain, your devices must have the [Cloudflare certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/install-cloudflare-cert/) installed. Enterprise users can also [deploy their own root CA certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/).

## Enable the block page for HTTP policies

Gateway automatically enables a block page for all HTTP policies. When a user is blocked at the HTTP layer, the block page is displayed.

To specify a policy-specific block message:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Firewall Policies** > **HTTP**.
2. Find the policy you want to customize and select **Edit**. You can only edit the block page for policies with a Block action.
3. Scroll down to the **Configure policy settings** step.
4. In the **Block page customised text** field, enter a custom block message.
5. Select **Save policy**.

Users will now see a custom message when they are blocked by this HTTP policy.

## Troubleshoot the block page

If your users see a "Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead" message in their browser when visiting a blocked page, check that you have correctly installed the Cloudflare certificate on their device.

### Allow users to email an administrator

You can add a Mailto link to your custom block page, which allows users to directly email you about the blocked site. When users select **Contact your Administrator** on your block page, an email template opens with the email address and subject line you configure, as well as the following diagnostic information:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
