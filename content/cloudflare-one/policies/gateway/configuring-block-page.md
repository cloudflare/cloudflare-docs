# Configure block page

Gateway responds to any domain blocked at the DNS level with `0.0.0.0` (for IPv4) or `::` (for IPv6), and does not return that blocked domain's IP address. As a result, the browser will show a default error page, and users will not be able to reach that website. This may cause confusion and lead some users to think that their Internet connection is not working.

Configuring a custom block page in Zero Trust helps avoid this confusion. Your block page will display information such as the rule ID of the policy blocking the website, a policy-specific block message, your organization's name, and a global message you may want to show â€” for example, a message explaining that the website has been blocked by Gateway and providing any points of contact for support within the organization.

## Prerequisites

In order to display the block page as the URL of the blocked domain, your devices must have the [Cloudflare certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/install-cloudflare-cert/) installed. Enterprise users can also [deploy their own root CA certificate](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/user-side-certificates/custom-certificate/).

## Enable the block page for HTTP policies

Gateway automatically enables a generic block page for all HTTP Block policies.

To specify a policy-specific block message:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall Policies** > **HTTP**.
2. Find the policy you want to customize and select **Edit**. You can only edit the block page for policies with a Block action.
3. Under **Configure policy settings**, go to **Display block page**. Choose _Show a custom message_.
4. In **Custom message**, enter a block message to show users.
5. Select **Save policy**.

Gateway will display a custom message when your users are blocked by this HTTP policy.

## Troubleshoot the block page

If your users see a "Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead" message in their browser when visiting a blocked page, check that you have correctly installed the Cloudflare certificate on their device.

## Customize the block page

### Allow users to email an administrator

You can add a Mailto link to your custom block page, which allows users to directly email you about the blocked site. When users select **Contact your Administrator** on your block page, an email template opens with the email address and subject line you configure, as well as the following diagnostic information:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Site URL     | The URL of the blocked page.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rule ID      | The ID of the Gateway policy that blocked the page.                                                                                                                                     |
| Source IP    | The public source IP of the user device.                                                                                                                                                |
| Account ID   | The Cloudflare account associated with the block policy.                                                                                                                                |
| User ID      | The ID of the user who visited the page. Currently, User IDs are not surfaced in the dashboard and can only be viewed by calling the [API](/api/operations/zero-trust-users-get-users). |
| Device ID    | The ID of the device that visited the page. This is generated by the WARP client.                                                                                                       |
| Block Reason | Your policy-specific block message.                                                                                                                                                     |
