# Isolation policies

With Browser Isolation, you can define policies to dynamically isolate websites based on identity, security threats, or content.

## Isolate

When an HTTP policy applies the Isolate action, the user's web browser is transparently served an HTML compatible remote browser client. Isolation policies can be applied to requests that include `Accept: text/html*`. This allows Browser Isolation policies to co-exist with API traffic.

The following example enables isolation for all web traffic:

| Selector            | Operator | Value           | Action         |
| --------------------| ---------| ----------------| -------------- |
| Host          | matches regex  | `.*` | Isolate        |

If instead you need to isolate specific pages, you can list the domains for which you would like to isolate traffic:

| Selector | Operator | Value | Action |
| - | - | - | - |
| Domain | In | `example.com`, `example.net` | Isolate

Existing cookies and sessions from non-isolated browsing are not sent to the remote browser. Websites that implement single sign-on using third-party cookies will also need to be isolated.

For example, if `example.com` authenticates using Google Workspace, you will also need to isolate the top level [Google Workspace URLs](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9012184).

## Do Not Isolate

You can choose to disable isolation for certain destinations or categories. The following configuration disables isolation for traffic directed to `example.com`:

| Selector | Operator | Value | Action |
| - | - | - | - |
| Host | In | `example.com` | Do Not Isolate |

## Policy settings

The following optional settings appear in the Gateway HTTP policy builder when you select the _Isolate_ action. Enable these settings to [prevent data loss](https://blog.cloudflare.com/data-protection-browser/) when users interact with untrusted websites in the remote browser.  

### Disable copy / paste

Prohibits users from copying and pasting content between a remote web page and their local machine.

### Disable printing

Prohibits users from printing remote web pages to their local machine.

### Disable keyboard

Prohibits users from performing keyboard input into the remote web page.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Mouse input remains available (to allow users to navigate a website by following hyperlinks and scrolling). This does not prevent user input into third-party virtual keyboards within a remote web page.

### Disable upload

Prohibits users from uploading files from their local machine into a remote web page.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
This option does not prevent files being uploaded to websites from third-party cloud file managers or files downloaded into the remote browser download bar from other isolated websites. To prevent files being uploaded from the remote browser into an isolated website, use HTTP Policies to block by [Upload Mime Type](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/#download-and-upload-mime-type).
{{</Aside>}}

### Disable download

Prohibits users from exporting files from the remote browser to their local machine.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
This option does not prevent files from being downloaded into the remote browser. To prevent files being downloaded into the remote browser, use HTTP Policies to block by [Download Mime Type](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/#download-and-upload-mime-type).
{{</Aside>}}

### Disable clipboard redirection

Prevents copying isolated content from the remote browser to their local clipboard and pasting content from their local clipboard into isolated pages.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
This option does not prevent clipboard interactions between isolated websites. Use [Disable copy / paste](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/isolation-policies/#disable-copy--paste) to prohibit clipboard use on sensitive isolated applications.

Disable copy / paste and Disable clipboard redirection are mutually exclusive and cannot be used in conjunction with each other.
