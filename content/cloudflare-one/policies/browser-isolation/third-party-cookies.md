# Enable third-party cookies

Browser Isolation currently depends on third-party cookies to maintain a short-lived session between your local browser and the remote isolated browser.

Each web browser treats third-party cookies differently, and some browsers (for example, Chrome and Firefox) may only present this error while incognito / private browsing mode is active. Depending on how your browser is configured, you may need to enable third-party cookies to access isolated websites.

Follow these instructions to enable third-party cookies in your browser:

## Chrome (Incognito mode)

1.  Open Chrome.
2.  At the top right, click the three-dot menu and go to **Settings**.
3.  Go to **Privacy and security** > **Cookies and other site data**.
4.  Click **Allow all cookies**.

## Firefox (Private Browsing mode)

1.  Open Firefox.
2.  Click **Tools** > **Options**.
3.  Click **Privacy** in the top panel.
4.  Select the checkbox labeled *Accept cookies from sites*.
5.  Select the checkbox labeled *Accept third-party cookies*.
6.  Click **OK**.

## Safari

1.  Open Safari.
2.  Go to **Preferences** > **Privacy**.
3.  Under the **Cookies and website data** section, un-select both:
    *   Prevent cross-site tracking
    *   Block all cookies
4.  Close the Preferences window.

## Brave

1.  Open Brave.
2.  Click the menu and go to **Settings**.
3.  Go to **Privacy and Security** > **Cookies and other site data**.
