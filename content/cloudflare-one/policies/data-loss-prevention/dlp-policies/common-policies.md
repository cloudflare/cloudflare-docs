# Common DLP policies

The following in-line DLP policies are commonly used to secure data in uploaded and downloaded files.

## Log uploads/downloads

The **Allow** action functions as an implicit logger, providing visibility into where your sensitive data is going without impacting the end user experience. The following example scans for your enabled Financial Information profile entries when users upload or download data to file sharing apps.

| Policy name |
| ---- |
| Log Financial Information file sharing|

| Selector | Operator | Value |
| - | - | - |
| DLP Profile | in | `Financial Information` |
| Content Category  | in | `File Sharing` |

|Action|
|------|
|Allow |

## Block uploads/downloads for specific users

You can configure access on a per-user or group basis by adding [identity-based conditions](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/identity-selectors/) to your policies. The following example blocks only contractors from uploading/downloading Financial Information to file sharing apps.

| Policy name |
| ---- |
| Block Financial Information file sharing for contractors |

| Selector | Operator | Value |
| - | - | - |
| DLP Profile | in | `Financial Information` |
| Content Category  | in | `File Sharing` |
| User Group Names | in | `Contractors` |

|Action|
|------|
|Block |

## Exclude Android applications

Many Android applications (such as Google Drive) use [certificate pinning](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#certificate-pinning), which is incompatible with Gateway inspection. If needed, you can create a [Do Not Inspect policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/#do-not-inspect) so that the app can continue to function on Android:

1. Set up an [OS version device posture check](/cloudflare-one/identity/devices/warp-client-checks/os-version/) that checks for the Android operating system.

2. Create the following HTTP policy in Gateway:

    | Policy name |
    | ---- |
    | Do not DLP Google Drive on Android |

    | Selector | Operator | Value |
    | - | - | - |
    | Passed Device Posture Checks | in | `OS Version Android` |
    | Application  | in | `Google Drive` |

    |Action|
    |------|
    |Do Not Inspect |

Android users can now use the app, but the app traffic will bypass DLP scanning.

## Exclude specific sites

In your [DLP logs](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/dlp-policies/#4-view-dlp-logs), you may find that certain sites are a common source of noise. To exempt these sites from DLP scanning:

1. [Create a list](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/lists/) of hostnames or URLs.

2. Exclude the list from your DLP policy as shown in the example below:

    | Policy name |
    | ---- |
    | Block Financial Information uploads to Google Drive |

    | Selector | Operator | Value |
    | - | - | - |
    | DLP Profile | in | `Financial Information` |
    | Application  | in | `Google Drive` |
    | Domain | not in list | `Do not DLP - SSN` |

    |Action|
    |------|
    |Block |
