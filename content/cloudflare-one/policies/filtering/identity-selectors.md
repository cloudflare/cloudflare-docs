# Identity-based policies

With Cloudflare Zero Trust, you can create Secure Web Gateway policies that filter outbound traffic down to the user identity level. To do that, you can build DNS, HTTP or Network policies using a set of [identity-based selectors](#identity-based-selectors). These selectors require Gateway with WARP mode to be enabled in the Zero Trust WARP client, and the user to be enrolled in your organization via the WARP client.

## IdP integration

Cloudflare Gateway can integrate with your organization's identity providers (IdPs). Before building a Gateway policy for IdP users or groups, be sure to [add the IdP as a login method](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/).

Gateway retrieves a user's IdP data at the time of login. Therefore, if you add or remove a user from a group in your IdP, Gateway will not detect these changes until the user re-authenticates to your Zero Trust instance. There are two ways a user can re-authenticate:

- Log out from an Access-protected application and log back in.
- In their WARP client settings, click **Preferences**>**Account**>**Re-Authenticate Session**. This will open a browser window and prompt the user to log in.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Gateway groups vs. Access groups">}}

In Gateway, a **User Group** refers to a group in your IdP (for example, an Okta group). Gateway does not currently support applying DNS, HTTP, and Network policies to [Access groups](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/groups/). This is because Access groups may include criteria not available through the IdP, such as device location or IP address.

### User Email

Use this selector to create identity-based DNS rules based on a userâ€™s email.

| UI name    | API example value                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| User Email | `identity.email == "user-name@company.com"` |

### User Name

Use this selector to create identity-based DNS rules based on an IdP username for a particular user in the IdP.

| UI name   | API example                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| User Name | `identity.name == "user-name"` |

### User Group IDs

Use this selector to create identity-based DNS rules based on an IdP group ID of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

| UI name        | API example                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| User Group IDs | `identity.groups.id == "12jf495bhjd7893ml09o"` |

### User Group Email

Use this selector to create identity-based DNS rules based on an IdP group email address of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

| UI name          | API example                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| User Group Email | `identity.groups.id == "contractors@company.com"` |

### User Group Names

Use this selector to create identity-based DNS rules based on an IdP group name of which the user is configured as a member in the IdP.

| UI name          | API example                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| User Group Email | `identity.groups.name == "\"finance\""` |

### SAML Attributes

Specify a value from the SAML Attribute Assertion.

| UI name         | API example                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SAML Attributes | `identity.saml_attributes == "\"finance\""` |
