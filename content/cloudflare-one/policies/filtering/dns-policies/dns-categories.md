# DNS Categories

Cloudflare Gateway’s DNS filtering capabilities allow you to block known and potential security risks on the public Internet, as well as specific categories of content. To give you more granular control over how to secure your network, Gateway also provides you with categorized security risks and content categories.

You can block security risks and content categories by creating DNS policies. Once you have configured your policies, you will be able to inspect network activity and the associated categories in your Gateway logs.

## DNS Security Categories

{{<Aside>}}

If you wish to block a hostname or URL that belongs to a security risk category, you need to block that category. If the security risk category is not configured as blocked, requests to that hostname or URL will appear in your Gateway logs as allowed requests.
