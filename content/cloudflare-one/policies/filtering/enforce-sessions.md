# Enforce WARP session duration

Cloudflare Zero Trust allows you to enforce session durations on Gateway Network and HTTP policies. Once a session expires, a user will be prompted to re-authenticate with the identity provider they used to enroll in the WARP client.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that traffic can reach your IdP and `<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` through WARP.

## Configure session duration

You can configure a WARP session for any Allow policy. To configure a session:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), navigate to either **Gateway** > **Firewall Policies** > **Network** or **Gateway** > **Firewall Policies** > **HTTP**.
2. Create a policy and select the _Allow_ action. Alternatively, choose any existing _Allow_ policy.
3. Under **Step 4 - Configure policy settings**, select **Edit** next to **Enforce WARP client session duration**.
4. Enter a session expiration time in `1h30m0s` format and save.
5. Save the policy.

Session checks are now enabled for the application protected by this policy.

## Limitations

- **Only one user per device** â€” If a device is already registered with User A, User B will not be able to log in on that device through the re-authentication flow. You can revoke a device registration by going to **My Team** > **Devices**.
