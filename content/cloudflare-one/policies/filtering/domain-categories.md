# Domain categories

Cloudflare Gateway allows you to block known and potential security risks on the public Internet, as well as specific categories of content. Domains are categorized by [Cloudflare Radar](/radar/glossary/#content-categories).

You can block security and content categories by creating DNS or HTTP policies. Once you have configured your policies, you will be able to inspect network activity and the associated categories in your Gateway logs.

## Filter by resolved IP category

When creating a DNS block policy for security or content categories, you can optionally enable **Filter traffic by resolved IP category** in the policy settings. When enabled, Gateway will block queries based on their resolved IP address in addition to the domain name. This setting may increase the number of false positives because domains in the blocked category can share IP addresses with legitimate domains.
