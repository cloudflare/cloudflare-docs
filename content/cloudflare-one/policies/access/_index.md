# Access policies

Cloudflare Access determines who can reach your application by applying the Access policies you configure.

An Access policy consists of an **Action** as well as rules which determine the scope of the action. To build a rule, you need to choose a **Rule type**, **Selector**, and a **Value** for the selector.

- [Actions](#actions)
- [Rule types](#rule-types)
- [Selectors](#selectors)

## Actions

Actions let you grant or deny permission to a certain user or user group. You can set only one action per policy.

### Allow

The Allow action allows users that meet certain criteria to reach an application behind Access.

The following example lets any user with an `@example.com` email address, as validated against an IdP, reach the application:

| Action | Rule type | Selector          | Value |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Allow  | Include   | Emails Ending In: | `@example.com` |

You can add a Require rule in the same policy action to enforce additional checks. Finally, if the policy contains an Exclude rule, users meeting that definition are prevented from reaching the application.

For example, this second configuration lets any user from Portugal with a `@team.com` email address, as validated against an IdP, reach the application, except for `user-1` and `user-2`:

| Action | Rule type | Selector | Value |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | -----------|
| Allow  | Include | Country | `Portugal` |
|        | Require | Emails Ending In | `@team.com` |
|        | Exclude | Email | `user-1@team.com`, `user-2@team.com` |

### Block

The Block action prevents users from reaching an application behind Access.

For example, this configuration blocks every request to the application, except for requests from `user-1@team.com`:

| Action | Rule type | Selector | Value |
| ------ | --------- | -------- |-------|
| Block  | Include   | Everyone | `Everyone` |
|        | Exclude   | Email    | `user-1@team.com`|

### Bypass

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Warning">}}

Bypass does not enforce any Access security controls and requests are not logged. This should be tested before deploying to production. Consider using Service Auth if you would like to enforce policies and maintain logging without requiring user authentication.

{{</Aside>}}

The Bypass action disables any Access enforcement for traffic that meets the defined rule criteria. Bypass is typically used to enable applications that require specific endpoints to be public. For example, some applications have an endpoint under the `/admin` route that must be publicly routable. In this situation, you could create an Access application for the domain `test.example.com/admin/<your-url>` and add the following Bypass policy:

| Action | Rule type  | Selector  | Value             |
|--------| ------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Bypass  | Include | Everyone | `Everyone` |

As part of implementing a Zero Trust security model, we do not recommend using Bypass to grant direct permanent access to your internal applications. To enable seamless and secure access for on-network employees, use Cloudflare Tunnel to [connect your private network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/) and have users connect through WARP.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

When applying a Bypass action, security settings revert to the defaults configured for the zone and any configured Page Rules. If **Always use HTTPS** is enabled for the site, then traffic to the bypassed destination continues in HTTPS. If **Always use HTTPS** is disabled, traffic is HTTP.

{{</Aside>}}

### Service Auth

Service Auth rules enforce authentication flows that do not require an identity provider IdP login, such as service tokens and mutual TLS.

| Action | Rule type | Selector |
| ------ | --------- | -------- |
| Service Auth  | Include   | Valid certificate |

## Rule types

Rules work like logical operators. They help you define which categories of users your policy will affect.

| Include | Exclude | Require |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| The Include rule is similar to an OR logical operator. In case more than one Include rule is specified, users need to meet only one of the criteria. | The Exclude rule works like a NOT logical operator. A user meeting any Exclusion criteria will not be allowed access to the application. | The Require rule works like an AND logical operator. A user must meet all specified Require rules to be allowed access. |

All Access policies must contain an Include rule. This is what defines the initial pool of eligible users who can access an application. You can then add Exclude and Require rules to enforce specific policies for those users.

### Requiring multiple conditions

When setting up a Require rule for an Access policy, keep in mind that any values you add to the rule will be concatenated by an AND operator. For example, let's say you want to grant access to an application to both the full-time employees and the contractors, and only the ones based in specific countries — say Portugal and the United States. If you set up a rule with the following configuration:

| Action | Rule type   | Selector         | Value                                 |
| -------| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Allow  | Require | Emails ending in | `@cloudflare.com`, `@contractors.com` |
|        | Require | Country          | `United States`, `Portugal`           |

the policy will only grant access to people reaching the application from both the United States AND Portugal, and who have both an email ending in `@cloudflare.com` AND in `@contractors.com`. Therefore, nobody will have access to the application.

Instead, you can address this need by using [Access groups](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/groups/). First, you can set up a group (we will call it `My Access Group`) that includes users in Portugal OR in the United States:

| Rule type    | Selector | Value                       |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Include | Country  | `United States`, `Portugal` |

Next, you can create a policy for your application that requires the group, and that also includes users with emails ending in either `@cloudflare.com` OR `@contractors.com`:

| Action | Rule type   | Selector          | Value                                 |
| -------| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Allow  | Require | `My Access Group` | -                                     |
|        | Include | Emails ending in  | `@cloudflare.com`, `@contractors.com` |

## Selectors

When you add a rule to your policy, you will be asked to specify the criteria/attributes you want users to meet. These attributes are available for all Access application types, including [SaaS](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/saas-apps/), [self-hosted](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/), and [non-HTTP](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/) applications.

Identity-based attributes are only checked when a user authenticates to Access, whereas non-identity attributes are polled continuously for changes during the [user session](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/session-management/). If you have configured [SCIM provisioning](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/scim/), you can force a user to re-attest all attributes with Access whenever you revoke the user in the IdP or update their IdP group membership.

{{</table-wrap>}}

<sup>1</sup> For SaaS applications, Access can only enforce policies at the time of initial sign on and when reissuing the SaaS session. Once the user has authenticated to the SaaS app, session management falls solely within the purview of the SaaS app.

## Order of execution

Policies are evaluated based on their action type and ordering. Bypass and Service Auth policies are evaluated first, from top to bottom as shown in the UI. Then, Block and Allow policies are evaluated based on their order.

For example, if you have a list of policies arranged as follows:

- Allow A
- Block B
- Service Auth C
- Bypass D
- Allow E

The policies will execute in this order: Service Auth C > Bypass D > Allow A > Block B > Allow E. Once a user matches an Allow or Block policy, evaluation stops and no subsequent policies can override the decision.

## Common misconfigurations

If you add any of the following rules to an Allow policy, anyone will be able to access your application.

### Include everyone

| Rule type    | Selector | Value                       |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Include | Everyone | `Everyone` |

### Include all valid emails

| Rule type| Selector | Value                       |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Include | Login Methods | `One-time PIN` |
