# Connect to Google Workspace through Access

This tutorial covers how to configure Cloudflare Access as a single sign-on provider for your Google Workspace account.

**Time to complete:** 15 minutes

## 1. Create an application in Zero Trust

1. Log in to [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Access** > **Applications**.

2. Select **SaaS application**.

3. Fill in the following information:
   - **Application**: _Google_.
   - **Entity ID**: `google.com`
   - **Assertion Consumer Service URL**: `https://www.google.com/a/<your_domain.com>/acs`, where `<your_domain.com>` is your Google Workspace domain.
   - **Name ID Format**: _Email_.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
When you put your Google Workspace behind Access, users will not be able to log in using [Google](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/google/) or [Google Workspace](/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/gsuite/) as an identity provider.
{{</Aside>}}

4. On the next page, [create an Access policy](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) for your application. For example, you could allow users with an `@your_domain.com` email address.

5. On the next page, you will see your **SSO endpoint**, **Access Entity ID or Issuer**, and **Public key**. These values will be used to configure Google Workspace.

## 2. Create a certificate from your public key

1. Copy and then paste your **Public key** into a text editor.
2. Wrap the certificate in `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. For example,

   ```txt
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <PUBLIC_KEY>
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

3. Set the file extension as `.crt` and save.

## 3. Create an SSO provider in Google Workspace

1. Log in to your [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Security** > **Authentication** > **SSO with third party IdP**.
3. Select **Third-party SSO profile for your organization**.
4. Enable **Set up SSO with third-party identity provider**.
5. Fill in the following information:
   - **Sign-in page URL**: Copy and then paste your **SSO endpoint** from Zero Trust.
   - **Sign-out page URL**: `https://<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/logout`, where `<team-name>` is your Zero Trust [team name](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#team-name).
   - **Verification certificate**: Upload the certificate file containing your public key.
6. (Optional) Enable **Use a domain specific issuer**. If you select this option, Google will send an issuer specific to your Google Workspace domain (`google.com/a/<your_domain.com>` instead of the standard `google.com`).

## 4. Test the integration

To test the integration, open an incognito browser window and go to `https://mail.google.com/`. An Access login screen should appear.

## Troubleshooting

`Error: ‚ÄúG Suite - This account cannot be accessed because the login credentials could not be verified.‚Äù`

If you see this error, it is likely that the public key and private key do not match. Confirm that your certificate file includes the correct public key.
