# Gateway activity logs

{{<Aside>}}

Gateway logs will only show the public Source IP address. Private IP addresses are NAT-ed behind a public IP address.

{{</Aside>}}

Gateway activity logs show the individual DNS queries, Network packets, and HTTP requests inspected by Gateway. You can also download encrypted [SSH command logs](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/network-policies/ssh-logging/) for sessions proxied by Gateway.

To view Gateway activity logs, log in to your [Zero Trust dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Logs** > **Gateway**. Click on an individual row to investigate the event in more detail.

## Selective logging

By default, Gateway logs all events, including DNS queries and HTTP requests that are allowed and not a risk. You can choose to disable logs or only log blocked requests. To customize what type of events are recorded, log in to your [Zero Trust dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Settings** > **Network**. Under **Activity Logging**, indicate your DNS, Network, and HTTP log preferences.

These settings will only apply to logs displayed on the Zero Trust dashboard. [Logpush data](#export-gateway-logs-with-logpush) is unaffected.

## HTTP logs

{{<Aside type="note">}}

When an HTTP request results in an error, the first 512 bytes of the request are logged for 30 days for internal troubleshooting. Otherwise, HTTP bodies are not logged.

| Field              | Description                                                                                                              |

| **Time**           | The timestamp of the HTTP request                                                                                        |

| **Policy details** | The policy corresponding to the decision Gateway made based on the traffic criteria of the request.                      |

{{</table-wrap>}}

### Isolate requests

When a user creates a policy to isolate traffic, the initial request that triggers isolation will be logged as an `Isolate` decision and the `is_isolated` field will return `false`. This is because that initial request is not isolated yet — but it initiates an isolated session.

Since the request is generated in an isolated browser, the result is rendered in the isolated browser and rendered back to the user securely. This request and all subsequent requests in the isolated browser are logged to include the terminal Gateway action that gets applied (e.g. Allow / Block) and the `is_isolated` field as `true`.

## Export Gateway logs with Logpush

{{<Aside>}}

This feature is only available on the Zero Trust Enterprise plan.

{{</Aside>}}

You can configure the automatic export of Gateway logs to third-party storage destinations or to security information and event management (SIEM) tools. Once exported, your team can analyze and audit the data as needed.

This feature builds on Cloudflare's Logpush Service — refer to the Logpush documentation to find a list of available fields for [DNS](/logs/reference/log-fields/account/gateway_dns/), [Network](/logs/reference/log-fields/account/gateway_network/), and [HTTP](/logs/reference/log-fields/account/gateway_http/) logs.

To enable Logpush for Gateway logs:

1. In the [Zero Trust dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/), navigate to **Logs** > **Logpush**.
2. Click **Connect a service**.
3. Enter a **Job name**.
4. From the drop-down menu, choose whether to export the _Gateway DNS_, _Gateway Network_, or _Gateway HTTP_ dataset.
5. Next, select the data fields you want to include in the log.
6. In the **Advanced settings** card, choose the timestamp format you prefer, and whether you want to enable logs sampling.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Select the service you want to export your logs to.
9. Follow the service-specific instructions on the Zero Trust dashboard to validate your destination.

The setup of your Logpush integration is now complete. Logpush will send updated logs every five minutes to your selected destination.

You can configure multiple destinations and add additional fields to your logs by returning to the **Logpush** page.
