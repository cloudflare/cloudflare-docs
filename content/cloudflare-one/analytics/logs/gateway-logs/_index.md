# Gateway activity logs

{{<Aside>}}

Gateway logs will only show the public Source IP address. Private IP addresses are NAT-ed behind a public IP address.

{{</Aside>}}

Gateway activity logs show the individual DNS queries, Network packets, and HTTP requests inspected by Gateway. You can also download encrypted [SSH command logs](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/network-policies/ssh-logging/) for sessions proxied by Gateway.

To view Gateway activity logs, log in to your [Zero Trust dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Logs** > **Gateway**. Click on an individual row to investigate the event in more detail.

## Selective logging

By default, Gateway logs all events, including DNS queries and HTTP requests that are allowed and not a risk. You can choose to disable logs or only log blocked requests. To customize what type of events are recorded, log in to your [Zero Trust dashboard](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/) and navigate to **Settings** > **Network**. Under **Activity Logging**, indicate your DNS, Network, and HTTP log preferences.

These settings will only apply to logs displayed on the Zero Trust dashboard. [Logpush data](/cloudflare-one/analytics/logs/logpush/) is unaffected.

## HTTP logs

{{<Aside type="note">}}

When an HTTP request results in an error, the first 512 bytes of the request are logged for 30 days for internal troubleshooting. Otherwise, HTTP bodies are not logged.

| **Referer**        | The Referer request header contains the address of the page making the request.                                          |
| **User Agent**     | The user agent header sent in the request by the originating device.                                                     |

| **HTTP version**   | The HTTP version of the origin that Gateway connected to on behalf of the user.                                          |

{{</table-wrap>}}

### Enhanced file detection

Enhanced file detection is an optional feature to extract more file information from HTTP traffic. When enabled, Gateway will read file information from the HTTP body rather than the HTTP headers, offering greater accuracy and reliability. This feature may have a minor impact on performance for file-heavy organizations.

To enable:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. Enable **TLS decryption**.
3. Turn on **Enable enhanced file detection**.

### Isolate requests

When a user creates a policy to isolate traffic, the initial request that triggers isolation will be logged as an `Isolate` decision and the `is_isolated` field will return `false`. This is because that initial request is not isolated yet — but it initiates an isolated session.

Since the request is generated in an isolated browser, the result is rendered in the isolated browser and rendered back to the user securely. This request and all subsequent requests in the isolated browser are logged to include the terminal Gateway action that gets applied (e.g. Allow / Block) and the `is_isolated` field as `true`.
