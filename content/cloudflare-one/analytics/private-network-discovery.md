# Private Network Discovery
The Private Network Discovery report gives you visibility over the users and applications that live on you private network. This information enables you to create identity and device-driven Zero Trust policies in Cloudflare Zero Trust, so that you can have control over the security of your private network.

On the Private Network Discovery report, you can gather information on what applications are accessed in your private network and who accessed it. You can also change an application's status according to your organization’s preferences. The default status for discovered origins is Unreviewed. The page also gives you overview metrics of the data it collects.

Private Network Discovery can be found under **Analytics > Access** in the **Cloudflare Zero Trust** dashboard.
