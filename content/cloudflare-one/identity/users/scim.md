# SCIM provisioning

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard protocol that allows identity providers (such as Okta) to synchronize user identity information with cloud applications and services. After you have enabled SCIM, user identities that you create, edit, or delete in the identity provider are automatically updated across all supported applications. This makes it easier for IT admins to onboard new users, update their groups and permissions, and revoke access in the event of an employee termination or security breach.

## Supported identity providers

Cloudflare Access currently supports SCIM provisioning using the following identity providers:

- Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID)
- Okta

## Sync users and groups in Zero Trust policies



## Sync users and groups in SaaS applications
