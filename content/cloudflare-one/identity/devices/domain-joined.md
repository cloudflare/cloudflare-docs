The Domain Joined device posture attribute ensures that a user is a member of a specific Windows Active Directory domain.

To enable the Domain Joined check:

1.  On the Zero Trust Dashboard, navigate to **My Team** > **Devices** > **Device posture**.
1.  Click **+Add**.
1.  Select **Domain Joined**.
1.  Enter a descriptive name for the check.
1.  Enter the domain you want Domain Joined to check for.
1.  Click **Save**.

Your device posture attribute is now visible on the **Device posture** page.

### Validate the domain value on your Windows device

1.  Open a Powershell window.
1.  Run the `(Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain` command to determine the value of your domain.
