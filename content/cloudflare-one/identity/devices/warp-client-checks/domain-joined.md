The Domain Joined device posture attribute ensures that a user is a member of a specific Windows Active Directory domain.

## Enable the Domain Joined check

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
1. Scroll down to **WARP client checks** and select **Add new**.
1. Select **Domain Joined**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the check.
1. Select your operating system.
1. Enter the domain you want to check for, such as `example.com`.
1. Select **Save**.

Next, go to **Logs** > **Posture** and [verify](/cloudflare-one/analytics/logs/posture-logs) that the Domain Joined check is returning the expected results.

### Validate the domain value on your Windows device

1. Open a Powershell window.
1. Run the `(Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain` command to determine the value of your domain.

   ```txt
   (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem).Domain
   ```
