# WARP client checks

These device posture checks are performed by the [Cloudflare WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/). In order for your users to be able to authenticate, you must deploy the WARP client in _WARP with Gateway_ mode to your company devices. Users also must enroll into your organizationâ€™s Cloudflare Zero Trust account.
