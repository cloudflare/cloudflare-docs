# Uptycs

Device posture with Uptycs requires that the Uptycs agent and the Cloudflare WARP client are deployed on your devices. For this integration to function, our service-to-service posture check relies on the **serial\_number** being the same in both clients. Follow the instructions below to set up the check.

## Obtain Uptycs Settings

The following Uptycs values are needed to set up the Uptycs posture check:

*   Client key
*   Client Secret
*   Customer ID

## Set up Uptycs

We will update this section shortly.
