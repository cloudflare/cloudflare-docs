# Cloudflare authorization cookie

When you protect a site with Cloudflare Access, Cloudflare checks every HTTP request bound for that site to ensure that the request has a valid `CF_Authorization` cookie. If a request does not include the cookie, Access will block the request.

## Access JWTs

The `CF_Authorization` cookie contains the user's identity in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT).Cloudflare securely creates these tokens through the OAUTH or SAML integration between Cloudflare Access and the configured identity provider.

Two tokens are generated:

- **Global session token**: a token generated when a user logs in to Access. This token is stored as a cookie at your [team domain](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#team-domain) (for example, `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`) and prevents a user from needing to log in to each application.

- [**Application token**](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/application-token/): a token generated for each application that a user reaches. This token is stored as a cookie on the application (for example, `https://jira.site.com`) and may be used to [validate requests](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/validating-json) on your origin.

## Cookie settings

Cloudflare Access provides optional security settings that can be added to the browser cookies generated by Access for an authenticated user.

- [SameSite](#samesite-attribute)
- [HttpOnly flag](#httponly)
- [Binding cookie](#binding-cookie)
- [Cookie path](#cookie-path-attribute)

To enable these settings:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access** > **Applications**.

2. Locate the application you would like to configure and select **Edit**.

3. Select **Settings** and scroll down to **Cookie settings**.

4. Configure the desired cookie settings.

5. Select **Save application**.

### SameSite Attribute

The [SameSite](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) Attribute selector restricts the cookie to only being sent if the cookie’s defined site matches the site being requested in the browser. This adds protection against [cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery).

The selector options are:

- **None** - Cookies will be sent in all contexts, including cross-origin requests.
- **Lax** - Cookies are allowed to be sent with top-level navigations and will be sent along with GET requests initiated by third party websites.
- **Strict** - Cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites.

Refer to the [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) for more information.

#### When not to use SameSite

Do not enable SameSite restrictions if you have additional sites or applications that rely on a specific application’s authorization cookie.

### HttpOnly

The HttpOnly flag is a cookie attribute that prevents the cookie from being accessed by any client-side scripts, reducing the likelihood of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This flag is enabled by default.

#### When not to use HttpOnly

Do not enable HttpOnly if:

- You are using the Access application for non-browser based tools.
- You have software that relies on being able to access a user’s cookie generated by Access.

### Binding Cookie

The Binding Cookie is an additional cookie created when a user successfully authenticates, shared with Cloudflare to verify identity, and then stripped before it reaches the origin server. The Binding Cookie associates the browser with the Access token; the association protects against compromised authorization tokens because the origin webapp would never see this binding cookie. This protects against session hijack style attacks.

#### When not to use the Binding Cookie

Do not use the Binding Cookie for non-browser based Access applications that rely on protocols like SSH, RDP, etc.

### Cookie Path Attribute

The Cookie Path Attribute adds the application's path URL to the `CF_Authorization` cookie. When enabled, a user who logs in to `example.com/path1` must re-authenticate to access `example.com/path2`. When disabled, the `CF_Authorization` cookie is only scoped to the domain and subdomain.

## Allow cross-site cookies in Firefox

By default, Firefox Private Browsing mode blocks all cross-site cookies including the `CF_Authorization` cookie. For XHR requests to work in private windows, you will need to exempt your site and [team domain](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#team-domain) from the browser's tracking protection system.

To enable cross-site cookies in Firefox:

1. In Firefox, go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to **Cookies and Site Data**.
3. Select **Manage Exceptions**.
4. Enter the URL of your Access application (for example, `https://jira.site.com`) and select **Allow**.
5. Enter `https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` and select **Allow**.
6. Select **Save Changes**.

You can now make XHR requests to your Access application in Firefox Private Browsing mode.
