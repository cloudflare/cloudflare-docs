# Generic OIDC

Cloudflare Access has a generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) connector to help you integrate IdPs not already set in Access.

## Set up a generic OIDC

1. Visit your identity provider and create a client/app.

2. When creating a client/app, your IdP may request an **authorized redirect URI**. Enter your [team domain](/cloudflare-one/glossary/#team-domain) followed by this callback at the end of the path: `/cdn-cgi/access/callback`. For example:

   ```txt
   https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
   ```

3. Copy the content of these fields:

   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - Auth URL: The `authorization_endpoint` URL of your IdP
   - Token URL: The `token_endpoint` URL of your IdP
   - Certificate URL: The `jwks_uri` endpoint of your IdP to allow the IdP keys to sign the tokens

   You can find these values on your identity provider’s **OIDC discovery endpoint**. Some providers call this the “well-known URL”.

4. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), navigate to **Settings** > **Authentication**.

5. Under **Login methods**, click **Add new**.

6. Choose **OpenID Connect**..

7. Name your identity provider and fill in the required fields with the information obtained in Step 3.

8. (Optional) Enable [Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/) if the protocol is supported by your IdP. PKCE will be performed on all login attempts.

9. (Optional) Under **Optional configurations**, enter custom OIDC claims that you wish to add to your Access [application token](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/application-token/).

10. Click **Save**.

To test that your connection is working, navigate to **Authentication** > **Login methods** and click **Test** next to the login method you want to test. On success, a confirmation screen displays.

## Example API Configuration

```json
{
  "config": {
    "client_id": "<your client id>",
    "client_secret": "<your client secret>",
    "auth_url": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
