# Generic OIDC

Cloudflare Access has a generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) connector to help you integrate IdPs not already set in Access.

## Set up a generic OIDC

1. Visit your identity provider and create a client/app.

2. When creating a client/app, your IdP may request an **authorized redirect URI**. Enter the following URL:

    ```txt
    https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
    ```

    You can find your team name in Zero Trust under **Settings** > **Custom Pages**.

3. Copy the content of these fields:

   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - Auth URL: The `authorization_endpoint` URL of your IdP
   - Token URL: The `token_endpoint` URL of your IdP
   - Certificate URL: The `jwks_uri` endpoint of your IdP to allow the IdP keys to sign the tokens

   You can find these values on your identity provider’s **OIDC discovery endpoint**. Some providers call this the “well-known URL”.

4. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.

5. Under **Login methods**, select **Add new**.

6. Choose **OpenID Connect**..

7. Name your identity provider and fill in the required fields with the information obtained in Step 3.

8. (Optional) Enable [Proof of Key Exchange (PKCE)](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/) if the protocol is supported by your IdP. PKCE will be performed on all login attempts.

9. (Optional) Under **Optional configurations**, enter [custom OIDC claims](#oidc-claims) that you wish to add to users' identity. This information will be available in the [user identity endpoint](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/application-token/#user-identity).

10. Select **Save**.

To test that your connection is working, go to **Authentication** > **Login methods** and select **Test** next to the login method you want to test. On success, a confirmation screen displays.

## Optional configurations

### OIDC claims

OIDC integrations support the use of custom OIDC claims. Custom OIDC claims can be referenced in [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/), offering a means to control user access based on these specific attributes. Custom OIDC claims are not currently supported in Gateway policies.

#### Email claim

You can specify a custom **Email claim** name that Access will use to identify user emails. This is useful if your IdP does not return the standard `email` claim in the OIDC ID token.

#### Multi-record OIDC claims

Cloudflare Access extends support for multi-record OIDC claims. These claims are parsed out and can be individually referenced in policies. This feature enables granular access control and precise user authorization in applications.

Cloudflare Access does not support partial OIDC claim value references or OIDC scopes.
