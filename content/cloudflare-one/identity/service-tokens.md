# Service tokens

You can provide automated systems with service tokens to authenticate against your Zero Trust policies. Cloudflare Access will generate service tokens that consist of a Client ID and a Client Secret. Automated systems or applications can then use these values to reach an application protected by Access.

This section covers how to create, renew, and revoke a service token.

## Create a service token

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), navigate to **Access** > **Service Auth** > **Service Tokens**.

2. Select **Create Service Token**.

3. Name the service token. The name allows you to easily identify events related to the token in the logs and to revoke the token individually.

4. Choose a **Service Token Duration**. This sets the expiration date for the token.

5. Select **Generate token**. You will see the generated Client ID and Client Secret for the service token, as well as their respective request headers.

6. Copy the Client Secret.

   {{<Aside type="warning" header="Important">}}This is the **only time** Cloudflare Access will display the Client Secret. If you lose the Client Secret, you must generate a new service token.
   {{</Aside>}}

You can now use the service token in your [Access policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) and [device enrollment rules](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/manual-deployment/#set-device-enrollment-permissions). When creating these policies, select the `Service Auth` action to ensure that the identity provider login screen is not required for end users.

## Connect your service to Access

To authenticate to an Access application using your service token, add the following to the headers of any request:

`CF-Access-Client-Id: <Client ID>`

`CF-Access-Client-Secret: <Client Secret>`

If the service token is valid, Access generates a JWT scoped to the application. All subsequent requests with that JWT will succeed until the expiration of that JWT.

## Renew service tokens

Service tokens expire according to the token duration you selected when you created the token.

To renew the service token:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), navigate to **Access** > **Service Auth** > **Service Tokens**.
2. Locate the token you want to renew.
3. To extend the token's lifetime by one year, select **Refresh**.
4. To extend the token's lifetime by more than a year:
   1. Select **Edit**.
   2. Choose a new **Service Token Duration**.
   3. Select **Save**. The expiration date will be extended by the selected amount of time.

## Revoke service tokens

If you need to revoke access before the token expires, simply delete the token.

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), navigate to **Access** > **Service Auth** > **Service Tokens**.
2. **Delete** the token you need to revoke.

Services that rely on a deleted service token can no longer reach your application.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
When editing an Access application, clicking **Revoke existing tokens** revokes existing sessions but does not prevent the user from starting a new session. As long as the Client ID and Client Secret are still valid, they can be exchanged for a new token on the next request. To revoke access, you must delete the service token.

## Set a token expiration alert

An alert can be configured to notify a week before a service token expires to allow an administrator to invoke a token refresh.

To configure a service token expiration alert:

1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), navigate to the **Notifications** tab.
2. Select **Add**.
3. Select _Expiring Access Service Token_.
4. Enter a name for your alert and an optional description.
5. (Optional) Add other recipients for the notification email.
6. Select **Save**.

Your alert has been set and is now visible in the **Notifications** tab of the Cloudflare dashboard.
