# Add a self-hosted application

{{<render file="access/self-hosted-app-intro.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}

## Prerequisites

- [Add your domain](/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare.
- [Change your domain nameservers](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) to Cloudflare, or configure a [partial (`CNAME`) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).

## 1. Add your application to Access

{{<render file="access/_add-app-to-access.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}


## 2. Add an Access policy

{{<render file="access/_add-access-policy.md" productFolder="cloudflare-one">}}


## 3. (Optional) Configure advanced settings

You can configure the following advanced settings for your application:

- [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/cors/)
- [Cookie settings](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/#cookie-settings)
- [Automatic `cloudflared` authentication](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/#automatic-cloudflared-authentication)
- [Browser rendering](/cloudflare-one/applications/non-http/#rendering-in-the-browser)

To finish configuring the application, select **Add application**.

## 4. Connect your origin to Cloudflare

Next, set up a [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) to make your internal application available over the Internet.

## 5. Validate the Access token

To secure your origin, you must validate the [application token](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/) issued by Cloudflare Access.

One option is to configure the Cloudflare Tunnel daemon, `cloudflared`, to validate the token on your behalf. This is done by enabling [**Protect with Access**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/origin-configuration/#access) in your Cloudflare Tunnel settings. If you do not wish to use Cloudflare Tunnel, you can [manually configure your origin](/cloudflare-one/identity/authorization-cookie/validating-json/) to check all requests for a valid token.

Users can now connect to your self-hosted application after authenticating with Cloudflare Access.

## Product compatibility

When using Access self-hosted applications, the majority of Cloudflare products will be compatible with your application.

However, the following products are not supported:

- [Automatic Signed Exchanges](/speed/optimization/other/signed-exchanges/)
- [Automatic Platform Optimization](/automatic-platform-optimization)
- [Zaraz](/zaraz)

If these products are enabled for your Access application, disable them using a [Configuration Rule](/rules/configuration-rules/) scoped to the application domain.
