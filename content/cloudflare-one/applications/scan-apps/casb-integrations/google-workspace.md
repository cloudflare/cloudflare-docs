# Google Workspace

The Google Workspace integration detects a variety of user security, data loss prevention, and misconfiguration risks in an integrated Google Workspace account that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Google Workspace account with a Business Starter, Business Standard, Business Plus or Enterprise plan.
* [Super Admin privileges](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986) in Google Workspace.

## Integration permissions

For the Google Workspace integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Google API permissions:

* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.domain.readonly`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.security`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Google Workspace Admin SDK Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/authorizing).
