# Dropbox

The Dropbox integration detects a variety of data loss prevention, account misconfiguration, and user security risks in an integrated Dropbox account that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

- A Dropbox Business plan (Standard, Advanced, Enterprise, or Education)
- Access to a Dropbox Business account with Team admin permissions

## Integration permissions

For the Dropbox integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Dropbox permissions via an OAuth 2.0 app:

- `account_info.read`
- `files.metadata.read`
- `files.content.read`
- `sharing.read`
- `team_info.read`
- `team_data.member`
- `team_data.governance.write`
- `team_data.governance.read`
- `files.team_metadata.read`
- `members.read`
- `groups.read`
- `sessions.list`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Dropbox API Permissions documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#dropbox-api-permissions).

## Security findings

The Dropbox integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](/cloudflare-one/applications/scan-apps/manage-findings/#severity-levels).
