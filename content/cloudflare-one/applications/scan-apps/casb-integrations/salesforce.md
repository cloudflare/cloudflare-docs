# Salesforce

The Salesforce integration detects a variety of misconfiguration, data loss prevention, and user security risks in an integrated Salesforce environment that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Salesforce environment (most editions are compatible).
* Permissions to a Salesforce organization with either:

    * System Administrator permission
    * Permissions for View Setup and Configuration, Customize Applications, and Modify All Data 

## Integration permissions

For the Salesforce integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Salesforce permissions via a Connected App:

* `Manage user data via APIs (api)`
* `Manage user data via Web browsers (web)`
* `Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`
* `Access unique user identifiers (openid)`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Salesforce OAuth Tokens and Scopes documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm).

## Security findings

The Salesforce integration currently scans for the following findings, or security risks. Findings are grouped by category and then ordered by [severity level](/cloudflare-one/applications/scan-apps/manage-findings/#severity-levels).
