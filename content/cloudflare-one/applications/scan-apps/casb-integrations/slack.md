# Slack

The Slack integration detects a variety of user security, data loss prevention, and misconfiguration risks in an integrated Slack Workspace that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A Slack user account
* Membership in a Slack Workspace (Free, Pro, Business+, or Enterprise Grid)
* If you are not the Workspace Owner and the `Require App Approval` setting is enabled for the Workspace, [request permission](https://slack.com/help/articles/202035138-Add-apps-to-your-Slack-workspace) to install apps.

## Integration permissions

For the Slack integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Slack API permissions:

* `channels:read`
* `files:read`
* `groups:read`
* `users:read`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Slack Permission scopes reference](https://api.slack.com/scopes).
