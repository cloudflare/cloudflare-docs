# ServiceNow

{{<render file="casb/_integration-description.md" withParameters="ServiceNow;;ServiceNow instance">}}

## Integration prerequisites

- `admin` access to a ServiceNow instance
- Ability to [create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients)

## Integration permissions

For the ServiceNow integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following permissions:

- `Global` application scope

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [ServiceNow Application scope documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_GlobalScope.html).
