# GitHub

The GitHub integration detects a variety of user security, data loss prevention, and misconfiguration risks in an integrated GitHub Organization that could leave you and your organization vulnerable.

## Integration prerequisites

* A GitHub account with a Free, Pro, or Enterprise plan
* Membership to a GitHub Organization with Owner or GitHub App manager permissions

## Integration permissions

For the GitHub integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following GitHub API permissions:

| Permission | Access | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Administration | `Read-only` | View basic administrative information from the account. |
| Members | `Read-only` |  View metadata on organization members |
| Metadata | `Read-only` |  View metadata surrounding an organization's assets, excluding sensitive private repository information. |
| Organization administration | `Read-only` |  View information on organization settings |

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [GitHub App permissions reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps).

## Security findings
