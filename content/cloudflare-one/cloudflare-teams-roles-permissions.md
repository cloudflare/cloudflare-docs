# Roles and permissions

When creating a Cloudflare Zero Trust account, you will be given the Super Administrator role. With this role, you can invite members to join your Zero Trust account, and assign them different roles depending on the permissions you would like to give them. 

To check the list of members in your account, or to manage roles and permissions, refer to our [Account setup](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/manage-account-members/) documentation.

### Cloudflare Zero Trust PII

By default, only Super Administrators can view end users' PII in the Gateway activity logs, such as Device IDs, Source IPs, or user emails. No other roles will have the ability to read PII unless Super Administrators explicitly assign the **Cloudflare Zero Trust PII** role to them.

The Cloudflare Zero Trust PII role should be considered an add-on role, to be combined with any role from the table above. For example, Super Administrators may decide to assign the Cloudflare Gateway role to a user, and add the Cloudflare Zero Trust PII role to allow that user to access PII in the Gateway logs.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The Cloudflare Zero Trust PII role does not apply to Access audit logs. PII is always visible in Access logs.
