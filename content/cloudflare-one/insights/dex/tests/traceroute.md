# Traceroute test

A traceroute test measures the network path of an IP packet from an end-user device to a server. You can use the test results to troubleshoot network issues. For example, increased latency may indicate a problem with connectivity along the network path.

## Create a test

To set up a traceroute test for an application:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **DEX** > **Tests**.
2. Select **Add a Test**.
3. Fill in the following fields:
    - **Name**: Enter any name for the test.
    - **Target**: Enter the IP address of the server you want to test (for example, `192.0.2.0`). You can test either a public-facing endpoint or a private endpoint you have connected to Cloudflare.
    - **Test type**: Select _Traceroute_.
    - **Test frequency**: Specify how often the test will run. Input a minute value between 5 and 60.

The test will now run on all [supported devices](#supported-devices) connected to your Zero Trust organization.

Next, [view the results](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/view-results/) of your test.

## Test results

A traceroute test measures the following data:

| Data | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Round trip time | Time between sending out a packet and receiving a response from the target. |
| Number of hops | Number of routers encountered between the device and the target. |
| Packet loss | Percentage of IP packets that failed to receive a response. |
| Availability | Percentage of tests where at least one packet reached the destination. |

## Supported devices
