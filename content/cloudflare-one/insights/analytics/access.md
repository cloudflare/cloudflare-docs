- **Unique application users**: Chart showing the number of different users who accessed SaaS applications over time.
- **Top approved applications**: SaaS applications marked as [**Approved**](#approval-status) which had the greatest number of unique visitors.
- **Top unapproved applications**: SaaS applications marked as [**Unapproved**](#approval-status) which had the greatest number of unique visitors.
