# Gateway analytics

To see the top Allowed and Blocked requests across all of your DNS locations, go to **Analytics** > **Gateway**. You can filter the data by selecting a specific location and/or time.

- **Requests** — This chart shows an overview of the number of requests made by end users within the time period you specify. It shows a breakdown of requests based on the decision Gateway took (either Allowed or Blocked).

- **Allowed requests** — This chart shows a breakdown of the five domains which received the highest number of Allowed requests. It also shows the five domains which received the lowest amount of Allowed requests. By selecting **View all** to the right of either section of the chart, you will see a list of highest 100 and lowest 100 domains ranked by number of Allowed requests.

- **Top blocked requests** — This chart shows a breakdown of the five domains which received the highest number of Blocked requests. It also shows the five domains which received the lowest number of Blocked requests. By selecting **View all** to the right of either section of the chart, you'll see a list of highest 100 and lowest 100 domains ranked by number of Blocked requests.

- **Requests by category** — The charts in this card show a breakdown of the **Top allowed categories** and the **Top blocked categories** based on the number of requests that Gateway classified as belonging to a content category.
