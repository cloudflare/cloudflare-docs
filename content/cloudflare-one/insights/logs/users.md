# User logs

Cloudflare Zero Trust allows you to consult a comprehensive list of users who have authenticated to Cloudflare Zero Trust. For each user that logged in, you can see their name, their email address, and whether they’re actively utilizing a seat in both Access and Gateway.

To see your user list, go to **My Team** > **Users**.

## Revoke user sessions

Selecting the **Revoke** button next to a user will terminate all currently active sessions for that user, and revoke access to all their connected devices. If you want to prevent this user from logging in again, you need to manually remove this user from any existing policies that grant them access to your applications.

## View user details

Selecting the View button for any user will show you details for that user, such as:

- Their user details
- Devices they have connected to Cloudflare Zero Trust
- Their recent logins

Select **View all activity** to see a full list of the user’s login events.
