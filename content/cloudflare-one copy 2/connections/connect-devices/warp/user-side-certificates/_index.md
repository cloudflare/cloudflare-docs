# User-side certificates

Advanced security features such as [HTTPS traffic inspection](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/tls-decryption/), [Data Loss Prevention](/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/), [anti-virus scanning](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/antivirus-scanning/), and [Browser Isolation](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/) require users to install and trust a root certificate on their device. You can either install the certificate provided by Cloudflare (default option), or generate your own custom certificate and upload it to Cloudflare.
