# Authenticate with a Cloudflare API key

API keys are unique to each Cloudflare user and used only for authentication. An API key does not authorize access to accounts or zones. To ensure that the GraphQL Analytics API authenticates your queries, retrieve your Cloudflare Global API Key.

Learn how to [retrieve your API Key in the Cloudflare dashboard](/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/).
