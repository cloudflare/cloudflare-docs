# Provision Cloudflare with SCIM

By connecting a System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provider, you can provision access to the Cloudflare dashboard on a per-user basis.

Currently, we only provide SCIM support for Azure Active Directory and Okta in Self-Hosted Access applications.

For more information about SCIM support, refer to the [Announcing SCIM support for Cloudflare Access & Gateway](https://blog.cloudflare.com/access-and-gateway-with-scim/) blog post.

## Limitations

- You cannot update [user attributes](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/identity-selectors/) from the identity provider.
- If a user is the only Super Administrator on an Enterprise account, they will not be deprovisioned.
- Currently, Cloudflare does not support Okta Integration Network (OIN) integration. This integration is in review.

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare provisioning with SCIM is only available to Enterprise customers and requires a Cloudflare-specific feature flag. Contact your account team for more information.
- In Cloudflare, [Super Administrator](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/) access on the account that maintains [your SSO](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/).
- In other identity providers (IdP), access to the `Create groups` and `Manage applications` [permissions](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/custom-admin-role/about-role-permissions.htm).

## Provision using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD)

{{<Aside type="note">}}
If Microsoft Azure AD does not work, you can alternatively try using the [Microsoft Entra admin center](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-security/scim-setup/#provision-using-microsoft-entra).
{{</Aside>}}

### Set up the Microsoft Azure AD Enterprise application.

   1. Go to your Microsoft Azure AD instance > Enterprise Applications.
   2. Select **Create your own application** and name your application.
   3. Select **Integrate any other application you donâ€™t find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**.
   4. Select **Create**.

### Provision the Azure AD Enterprise application.

   1. Under **Manage** on the sidebar menu, select **Provisioning**.
   2. Select **Automatic** on the dropdown menu for the Provisioning Mode.
   3. Enter your API token value and the tenant URL: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<your_account_ID>/scim/v2`.
   4. Select **Test Connection**, then select **Save**.

### Configure user permissions in Azure AD

Currently, groups need to match a specific format to provision specific Cloudflare account-level roles. Cloudflare is in the process of adding Cloudflare Groups, which can take in freeform group names in the future.

These permissions work on an exact string match with the prefix `CF-<your_account_id> - <roleName>`

Refer to [Roles](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-security/scim-setup/scim-roles/) more details.

1. To ensure that only required groups are provisioned, go to your Microsoft Azure AD instance.
2. Under Manage on the sidebar menu, select **Provisioning**.
3. Select **Provision Azure Active Directory Groups** in Mappings.
4. Select **All records** under Source Object Scope.
5. Select **Add scoping filter** and create the appropriate filtering criteria to capture only the necessary groups.
6. Save the Attribute Mapping by selecting **OK** and return to the Enterprise Application Provisioning overview page.
7. Select **Start provisioning** to view the new users and groups populated on the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Provision using Microsoft Entra

   1. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, select **Overview** > **Manage provisioning**.
   2. Select **Add scoping filters**.
   3. Under Mappings, you can select filters for groups and users. 

   {{<Aside type="note">}}
   Microsoft does not currently support `MemberOf` group as a filter.
   {{</Aside>}}

   4. To target a specific set of users, select Provision Azure Active Directory Users then choose **All records** under Source Object Scope.
   5. Select **Add scoping filter** and add the appropriate scoping criteria to match the users that need to be synchronized. Any users that are not explicitly given the named Azure Groups will be provisioned to Cloudflare, but will not have any permissions attached
