# Cancel Cloudflare subscriptions

Cancellations are not processed until the end of the billing period, so you can continue using the add-on or subscription until the new billing period begins. To avoid unwanted charges, start the cancellation process before the end of your billing period.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

All billing period dates on invoices and the dashboard are in UTC/GMT timezone, not your local timezone. We recommend any downgrades or changes to subscriptions be made at least 24 hours before stated billing date to avoid any timezone confusion.
