# Communication preferences

When you create an account, Cloudflare automatically chooses your **Communication Preferences**, or when Cloudflare might occasionally send you emails.

To update the communication preferences for your profile (which requires a [verified email address](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/verify-email-address/)):

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Go to **My Profile**
3. For **Communication Preferences**, select **Edit**.
4. If you want a specific category of emails, make sure its associated box is checked.
5. Select **Save**.
