# Change Super Admininstrator

If you or someone in your organization leaves or loses access to email, you can add another Super Administrator.

First, [add a member](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/members/manage/) to your account and assign the **Super Administrator** role.

Then, if needed, remove the previous Super Administrator.
