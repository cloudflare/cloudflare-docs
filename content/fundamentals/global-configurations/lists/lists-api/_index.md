# Lists API

The [Lists API](/api/operations/lists-get-lists) provides an interface for programmatically managing the following types of lists:

* [IP Lists](/fundamentals/global-configurations/lists/ip-lists/): Contain IP addresses that you can reference collectively, by name, in rule expressions.

* [Bulk Redirect Lists](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/concepts/#bulk-redirect-lists): Contain URL redirects that you enable by creating a Bulk Redirect Rule.

To use a list in a rule expression, refer to [Values: Lists](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#lists) in the Rules language documentation.

## Get started

To get started, review the Lists [JSON object](/fundamentals/global-configurations/lists/lists-api/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/fundamentals/global-configurations/lists/lists-api/endpoints/).
