Cloudflare has several [IP address ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) which are shared by all proxied hostnames.

Together, these IP addresses form the backbone of our [Anycast network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/), helping distribute traffic amongst various edge network servers.
