The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by the United States Congress to address concerns about children's access to inappropriate or harmful content over the Internet. CIPA requires K-12 schools and libraries that receive certain federal funding to implement internet safety measures to protect minors from harmful online content. 
The law aims to prevent students from accessing explicit, obscene, or otherwise harmful material. It also emphasizes the use of technology protection measures, including DNS filtering, to safeguard against internet threats such as ransomware, phishing sites, and other potentially harmful content.
