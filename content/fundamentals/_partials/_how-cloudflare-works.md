Fundamentally, Cloudflare is a [large network of servers](/fundamentals/concepts/what-is-cloudflare/) that can improve the security, performance, and reliability of anything connected to the Internet.

Cloudflare does this by serving as a [reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/) for your web traffic. All requests to and from your origin flow through Cloudflare and — as these requests pass through our network — we can apply various rules and optimizations to improve security, performance, and reliability.
