Additionally, adjust various settings in your **Firewall** to restrict potentially malicious traffic:

*   Get automatic protection from common threats with our [Web Application Firewall](/waf/)
*   Set up customized [firewall rules](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules)
*   Enable [bot protection](/bots/get-started)
*   Block, challenge, or allow specific addresses with [IP access rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/217074967)
*   Create [rate limiting rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001635128) (usage-based billing) as a final defense against malicious traffic
