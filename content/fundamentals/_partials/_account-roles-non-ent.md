If you have an account on a Free, Pro, or Business plan, users can have the following roles:
- **Super Administrator - All Privileges** (only one allowed): Can edit any Cloudflare setting, make purchases, update billing, and manage memberships.
- **Administrator** (unlimited): Can access the full account and configure dashboard, but cannot manage billing or account membership.
    
The user who creates your account automatically becomes the Super Administrator. This is the only Super Administrator role allowed for your account. For more details, refer to [Change super administrator](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/manage-account-members/#change-super-administrator).
