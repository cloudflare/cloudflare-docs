## Review external tools
To avoid blocking Cloudflare IP addresses unintentionally, review your external tools to check that:

- Any security plugins — such as those for WordPress — allow Cloudflare IP addresses.
- The [ModSecurity](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity) plugin is up to date.

### Additional recommendations

#### Further protection

For further recommendations on securing your origin server, refer to our guide on [protecting your origin server](/fundamentals/basic-tasks/protect-your-origin-server/).

### Customize Cloudflare IP addresses

### IP range updates

Cloudflare's IP ranges do not change frequently. When they do change, they are added to our [list of IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/ips/) before being put into production. An email notification will be sent out in advance to give you enough time to make configuration changes. You can also use the Cloudflare API to programmatically keep your configuration updated.
