# What is Cloudflare?

{{<render file="_what-is-cloudflare.md" productFolder="fundamentals">}}

## What is a connectivity cloud?

A connectivity cloud is a new approach for delivering the many services companies need to secure and connect their digital environment. 

As a unified and intelligent platform of programmable cloud-native services, a connectivity cloud enables any-to-any connectivity between all networks (enterprise and Internet), cloud environments, applications and users. 

Cloudflare's connectivity cloud includes a huge array of security, performance, and developer services â€” not with an eye to replace everything everywhere, but with the ability to fit in wherever needed and consolidate many critical services onto a single platform.
