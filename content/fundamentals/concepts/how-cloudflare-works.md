# How Cloudflare works

The [Cloudflare global network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) can improve the security, performance, reliability, and privacy of anything connected to the Internet, such as your website, SaaS application, or corporate network.

## Application Services

To optimize your website or web application, Cloudflare acts as a [DNS provider](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) for your domain, and a [reverse proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/) for your web traffic.

### How Cloudflare works as a DNS provider

We support a few different [setups](/dns/zone-setups/) for using Cloudflare as a DNS provider. A [full DNS setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) is the most common, where Cloudflare becomes the primary authoritative DNS provider for your domain, after you [connect your domain to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/connect-your-domain/). This means we respond to DNS queries for your domain, and you [manage its DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) via the Cloudflare dashboard or API.

When Cloudflare receives a DNS query for your domain, our response is determined by the configuration [set in your DNS table](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/), including the value of the record, the record's [proxy eligibility](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#proxy-eligibility), and its [proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/).

If the [domain's status](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) is active and the queried DNS record is set to `proxied`, then Cloudflare responds with an [anycast IP address](/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/), **instead of** the value defined in your DNS table. This effectively re-routes the `HTTP/HTTPS` requests to the Cloudflare network, instead of directly reaching the targeted the [origin server](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/origin-server/).

In contrast, if the queried DNS record is set to `DNS only`, meaning the proxy is off, then Cloudflare responds with the value defined in your DNS table (that is, an IP address or CNAME record). This means `HTTP/HTTPS` requests route directly to the origin server and are not processed or protected by Cloudflare.

### How Cloudflare works as a reverse proxy

All DNS records in your DNS table have a [proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/), indicating whether or not `HTTP/HTTPS` traffic for that record will route through Cloudflare on its way between the client and the origin server. If the [domain's status](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) is active, all `HTTP/HTTPS` requests for [proxied DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/#proxied-records) route through Cloudflare.

As these requests pass through our network, they are processed according to your [configuration](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/connect-your-domain/#domain-configurations). Subsequently, legitimate requests are forwarded to the origin server.

Refer to our [Load Balancing reference architecture](/reference-architecture/architectures/load-balancing/) to learn more about advanced ways to forward traffic to your origins (or other {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="endpoint" link="/glossary/?term=endpoint">}}endpoints{{</glossary-tooltip>}}), as well as our [CDN reference architecture](/reference-architecture/architectures/cdn/) to learn more about how Cloudflare processes and optimizes your web traffic.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Proxying is on by default for records that serve `HTTP/HTTPS` traffic (`A`, `AAAA`, and `CNAME` records). To proxy `HTTP/HTTPS` traffic on [non-standard ports](/fundamentals/reference/network-ports/) or to proxy a `TCP-` or `UDP-` based application, use [Cloudflare Spectrum](/spectrum/).
{{</Aside>}}

In the Cloudflare dashboard, find out which DNS records are proxied by selecting your domain and navigating to the **DNS records** tab.

#### Example DNS table

| Type | Name | Content | Proxy status | TTL | Actions |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  ---: |
| `A` | `blog` | `192.0.2.1` | `Proxied` | `Auto` | `Edit` |
| `A` | `shop` | `192.0.2.2` | `DNS only` | `Auto` | `Edit` |

In the example DNS table above, there are two DNS records. The record with the name `blog` has the proxy on, while the record named `shop` has the proxy off (that is, `DNS only`).

#### Proxied DNS record example

When the browser initiates a `HTTP/HTTPS` request to `blog.example.com`, a DNS resolver will convert the hostname into an IP address. Since this domain is using Cloudflare as its Authoritative DNS provider, the DNS query will be routed to Cloudflare; and because the proxy is on, Cloudflare will answer with an anycast IP address. Subsequently, the browser initiates a `HTTP/HTTPS` request back to Cloudflare. When Cloudflare receives this request, it performs a lookup to find the matching domain and account configuration and processes the request accordingly. Cloudflare forwards it to the configured origin server, which is `192.0.2.1`.

#### DNS only record example

When the browser initiates a `HTTP/HTTPS` request to `shop.example.com`, a DNS resolver will convert the hostname into an IP address. Since this domain is using Cloudflare as its Authoritative DNS provider, the DNS query will be routed to Cloudflare; but since the proxy is off (that is, `DNS only`), Cloudflare will answer with `192.0.2.2`. Finally, the browser initiates a `HTTP/HTTPS` request to the server hosted at `192.0.2.2`.
