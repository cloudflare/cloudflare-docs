# Access to your account

Granting access to others on your account is done with several sets of data principals
1) Accounts have Account Members
2) Account Members have policies
3) Policies are constructed out of actors, roles, and scopes.

When assigning a new user, you can assign a policy to them directly, and if multiple policies are needed, they can be added/revoked at a later time.

## Super Administrator access

If you are a Super Administrator for an account that has existing domains and you decide to leave the account, you can invite a new Super Administrator who will have access to the same account privileges.

You can delete your user as a Super Administrator, but you cannot delete your account. Other Super Administrators will continue to have access to the appropriate privileges to manage the account, including billing information.
