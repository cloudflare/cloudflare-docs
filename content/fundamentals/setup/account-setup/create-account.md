# Create a Cloudflare account

To create a Cloudflare account:

1. Go to the [Sign up page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
2. Enter your **Email** and **Password**. 
3. Click **Create Account**.

Once you create your account, Cloudflare will automatically send an email to your address to [verify that email address](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/verify-email-address/).

## Best practices

If you are creating an account for your team or a business, we recommend choosing an email alias or distribution list for your **Email**, such as `cloudflare@example.com`.

This email address is the main point of contact for your Cloudflare billing, usage notifications, and account recovery.
