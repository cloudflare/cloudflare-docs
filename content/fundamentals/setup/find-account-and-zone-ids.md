# Find zone and account IDs

Once you [set up a new account](/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/) and [add your domain](/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare, you may need access to your zone and account IDs for API operations.

To find your zone and account IDs:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account and domain.
3. On the **Overview** page (the landing page for your domain), find the **API** section.

4. The **API** section contains your **Zone ID** and **Account ID**. To copy these values for API commands or other tasks, select **Click to copy**.

For more guidance on setting up API tokens and using the API, refer to our [Cloudflare API Documentation](/fundamentals/api/).
