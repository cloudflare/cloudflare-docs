# Edit webhooks

You can only edit the name of webhooks and/or delete them.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
1. Go to **Notifications**.
1. Click **Destinations** on the left side of your dashboard.
1. In the **Webhooks** card, click **Edit** on the webhook you want to edit.
1. Update the webhook's name and click **Save**.

You can also delete a webhook after clicking **Edit**. However, it is faster to click **Delete** in the list of webhooks displayed in the **Destinations** card.
