# Available Notifications

Available Notifications depend on your Cloudflare plan. Cloudflare offers a variety of Notifications for our products and services, such as Billing, Denial-of-Service protection, Magic Transit, and SSL/TLS.

Depending on your plan, you will also be able to configure webhooks (which allow you to connect your account with external services such as Slack and Google Chat) and PagerDuty to receive Cloudflare Notifications.

## Actions available on receiving a Notification

Each Notification carries different types of information about the status of your Cloudflare account, or the type of action you can take.
