# Cloudflare Notifications

Cloudflare Notifications help you stay up to date with your Cloudflare account. Manage your Notifications to define what you want to be warned about and how, be it a denial-of-service attack or an issue with your server.

The available Notification features vary according to your plan:

*   Free plans can set up email-based Notifications.
*   Business and higher plans can also [access PagerDuty](/fundamentals/notifications/create-notifications/create-pagerduty/).
*   Professional and higher plans can also [use webhooks](/fundamentals/notifications/create-notifications/configure-webhooks/).

## Where to find the Notifications section

Cloudflare Notifications is available in your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login). After logging in and choosing your account:

*   If you are using the new navigation interface, Cloudflare Notifications is available from the menu bar.
*   If you are using the original interface, Cloudflare Notifications is available on the top of your account's dashboard.

## What to do when receiving Notifications

Go to our [Types of Notifications](/fundamentals/notification-available/) section to know more about what each Notification does and what do to when receiving one.
