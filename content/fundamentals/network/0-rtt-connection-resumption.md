# 0-RTT Connection Resumption

Zero round trip time resumption (0-RTT) improves performance for clients who have previously connected to your website.

For more details on what 0-RTT is, how it works, and potential limitations, refer to [our blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/even-faster-connection-establishment-with-quic-0-rtt-resumption/).
