# Cloudflare Radar

Cloudflare Radar is a tool that gives you insights into Internet trends and patterns. It takes advantage of Cloudflare's network and data to create a picture of what is happening around the world. This data comes from Cloudflare's services, which handle millions of HTTP and DNS requests per second, from the billion unique IP addresses that connect to our edge network. When you add that to the billions of cyberthreats blocked every day by Cloudflare's security systems, you start to have a clear picture of what is happening around the world.

With Cloudflare Radar you can have an idea of the latest events currently happening on the Internet. This includes the adoption of new technologies, browsers or operating systems. Radar also keeps up to date with relevant events around the world to shed light on specific patterns - like the kind of traffic seen spiking during the early days of Covid-19.
