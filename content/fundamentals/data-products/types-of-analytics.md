# Types of analytics

 Cloudflare Analytics is further broken down into:
    *   **Account Analytics**: Shows you an overview of traffic for [all sites on your Cloudflare account](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360037857831), such as requests and bandwidth by country, information related to security, cache, and errors, among others.
    *   **Site analytics**: Gives you [insight on each site on your Cloudflare account](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360037684251). You can check information such as traffic, security, performance, DNS, Workers, and Logs (Enterprise domains only).
    *   **Product Analytics**: Beyond the overarching view of your Cloudflare account given by Account and Site analytics, Cloudflare also has analytics for several products that let you examine information specific to several products, such as the Firewall, Load Balancing, [Bots](/bots/bot-analytics/) and Web Analytics. Web Analytics in particular [provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website](/analytics/web-analytics/).
