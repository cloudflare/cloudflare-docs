# Types of analytics

Cloudflare analytics is a comprehensive product that encompasses all metadata generated by Cloudflare network. You can access these insights through Cloudflare dashaboard. Depending on where in the dashboard you are, it will show you different aspects from the metadata collected.

## Root-level analytics

### Account Analytics (beta)

Found at the root of your Cloudflare dashboard when you log in, Account Analytics (beta) shows you an [overview of traffic for all sites](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360037857831) on your Cloudflare account, such as requests and bandwidth by country, information related to security, cache, and errors, among others. Accessed at dashboard home, outside any accounts you may have.

### Network Analytics

Analytics that provide visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Only available for customers on an Enterprise plan who use [Spectrum](/spectrum/), [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/), or [Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)](/byoip/).


### Web Analytics

Web Analytics (formely known as Browser Insights) [provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website](/analytics/web-analytics/). Web Analytics does not collect your visitor's personal data, and allows you to have a detailed view into the performance of web pages as experienced by your visitors.


### Carbon Impact Report

Carbon Impact Report gives you a [report on carbon savings](https://blog.cloudflare.com/understand-and-reduce-your-carbon-impact-with-cloudflare/) from using Cloudflare services versus Internet averages for your usage volume.

Cloudflare is committed to use 100% renewable energy sources, but also to [remove all greenhouse gases emitted](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-committed-to-building-a-greener-internet/) as a result of powering our network since 2010.

## Analytics related to specific properties
