# Cloudflare Analytics vs. other analytics services

When you use Cloudflare Analytics to gain insights into your web properties, you might notice there are discrepancies in the data reported by other analytics products, such as Google Analytics. This is normal and expected.

This happens due to the underlying datasets Cloudflare captures and processes in determining analytic metrics for your properties. Please refer to [Cloudflare Analytics: A quick overview](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360037684111#4lt2VoRUorCudxN1xzxpOt) for more information.
