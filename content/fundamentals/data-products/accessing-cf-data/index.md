# Accessing the data Cloudflare collects

Access metadata about the Cloudflare network through analytics on Cloudflare dashboard, through Logs, or through the GraphQL APIs.

## Analytics

Access the following analytics from the Cloudflare Dashboard:

- Zone Analytics - Analytics gathered by each Cloudflare product, which are available within the **Analytics** application and within individual product applications
  - **Analytics** application - Aggregated traffic, security, and performance metrics for each orange-clouded domain. Data available on the **Analytics** application includes:
    - Traffic - Requests, Data transfer, Page views, Visits, and [API requests](/api-shield/security/api-discovery/#api-requests)
    - Security - Total Threats, Top Crawlers/Bots, Rate Limiting, Total Threats Stopped
    - Performance - Origin Performance, Bandwidth Saved
    - DNS - DNS Queries by Response Code, Record Type, and Cloudflare Data Center
    - Workers - Workers per zone, Workers KV per account
  - In-product - The analytics available within each product on the dash, like the Events summary, Events by service, and Top events by source data in Firewall. Data available in-product includes:
    - Firewall Events, [Bot Analytics](/bots/bot-analytics/) within the **Security** application
    - Browser Insights within the **Speed** application
    - Cache Performance within the **Caching** application
    - Load Balancing Analytics and Health Check Analytics within the **Traffic** application
- Account Analytics - Sum of traffic to all your sites
- Network Analytics - Analytics that provide visibility into network and transport-layer traffic patterns and DDoS attacks. Only available for customers on an Enterprise plan who use [Spectrum](/spectrum/), [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/), or [Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)](/byoip/).
- [Web Analytics](/analytics/web-analytics/) - Privacy-first analytics for your website that does not require changing your DNS or using Cloudflareâ€™s proxy

## Logs

Access Cloudflare Logs in one of two ways:

- Via [Logpush](/logs/about/) (recommended) - Push request or event logs from Cloudflare to your cloud service provider.
- Via [Logpull](/logs/logpull/) - Download only HTTP request logs using the [Logpull API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#logs-received-properties).

## GraphQL APIs

If you'd like more control over how you visualize the analytic and log information available on the Cloudflare dashboard, use the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) to build customized views.
