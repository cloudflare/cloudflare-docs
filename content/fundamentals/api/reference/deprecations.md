# API v4 deprecations

Cloudflare occassionally makes updates to our APIs that result in behavior changes or deprecations. When this happens, we will communicate when the API will no longer be available and whether there will be a replacement.

## Argo Tunnel
**End of life Date: February 4, 2024**

This endpoint and its related APIs are deprecated in favor of the Cloudflare Tunnels equivalent APIs.

Deprecated API:
- GET accounts/:account_identifier/tunnels
- POST accounts/:account_identifier/tunnels
- GET accounts/:account_identifier/tunnels/:tunnel_id
- DELETE accounts/:account_identifier/tunnels/:tunnel_id

Replacement:
Cloudflare Tunnel API

## Account Billing Profile, User Billing Profile, and User Billing History

**End of life Date: June 6, 2023**

Cloudflare will no longer continue to support these endpoints due to a system transition and low endpoint usage. There is no replacement for these endpoints. As an alternative, please log in to your Cloudflare account to view your:

- [Invoices & Billing Email](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/billing)
- [Billing subscriptions](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/billing/subscriptions) 
- [Billing profile payment info](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/billing/payment-info)
 
Deprecated API:

- GET `accounts/{account_identifier}/billing/profile`
- GET `user/billing/profile`
- GET `user/billing/history`

## Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers 
**End of life date: March 31, 2023**

Previously, RFC 2616 allowed the use of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` HTTP headers in the same request. RFC 7230 supersedes RFC 2616 and prohibits the use of `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers in the same request because they can cause HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities.

Starting on March 31, 2023, Cloudflare will decline requests with both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` HTTP headers.

## Access Bookmark applications
**End of life date: March 19, 2023**

This endpoint is deprecated in favor of using a specialized Access Application App Type API.

Deprecated API:
- GET accounts/:identifier/access/bookmarks
- GET accounts/:identifier/access/bookmarks/:uuid
- POST accounts/:identifier/access/bookmarks/:uuid
- PUT accounts/:identifier/access/bookmarks/:uuid
- DELETE accounts/:identifier/access/bookmarks/:uuid

Replacement:
Access applications app type API


## Page Shield
**End of life date: October 11, 2022**

Replace `script_monitor` in Page Shield API routes with `page_shield`.


## Cloudflare Images - Create authenticated direct upload URL v1
**End of life date: July 1, 2022**

This endpoint is deprecated in favor of using v2, which allows you to control metadata, define an access policy, and get the image ID.

Deprecated API:
POST accounts/:account_identifier/images/v1/direct_upload

Replacement:
POST accounts/:account_identifier/images/v2/direct_upload


## DNS Firewall Analytics - virtual_dns
**End of life date: July 1, 2022**

Replace `virtual_dns` in DNS Firewall Analytics routes with `dns_firewall`.


## DNS Firewall - virtual_dns
**End of life date: July 1, 2022**

Replace `virtual_dns` in DNS Firewall routes with `dns_firewall`.

The following changes were made in the new routes:

- `virtual_dns_ips` has been renamed to `dns_firewall_ips`.
- A disabled ratelimit is now represented by `null` instead of `0`.
- The `PATCH` method must be used instead of `PUT` to update clusters.

## Zone Analytics API
**End of life date: March 1, 2021**

This API is deprecated in favor of the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/), which provides equivalent data and more features, including the ability to select only the metrics that you need. For more information, refer to the [Zone analytics to GraphQL analytics migration guide](/analytics/graphql-api/migration-guides/zone-analytics/).

Deprecated API:
- GET zones/:zone_identifier/analytics/dashboard
- GET zones/:zone_identifier/analytics/colos

Replacement:
GraphQL Analytics API

## Zone settings - __cfduid
**End of life date: May 10, 2021**

The `__cfduid` cookie was set on Cloudflare HTTP responses and used for providing critical performance and security services on behalf of our customers. For more information on why we transitioned away from this cookie, refer to [Deprecating the `__cfduid` cookie](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/).

Cloudflare permanently stopped adding a `Set-Cookie` header on all HTTP responses on May 10, 2021. The last `__cfduid` cookies expired 30 days after that.

## `cf-request-id`
**End of life date: July 1, 2021**

In mid-2020, Cloudflare introduced `cf-request-id`, an experimental HTTP header. This header was present on requests sent to origins and returned in responses to eyeballs (users). After careful evaluation, we decided to remove the `cf-request-id` header.

If you require an identifier for requests, Cloudflare recommends using the CF-RAY header.

## Organizations
**End of life date: February 4, 2020**

This endpoint and its related APIs are deprecated in favor of the `/accounts` equivalent API, which has a broader range of features and is backwards compatible with the `/organizations` API.

Deprecated API:
- GET organizations/:identifier
- PATCH organizations/:identifier
- GET organizations/:organization_identifier/invites
- POST organizations/:organization_identifier/invites
- GET organizations/:organization_identifier/invites/:identifier
- PATCH organizations/:organization_identifier/invites/:identifier
- DELETE organizations/:organization_identifier/invites/:identifier
