## How long does it take for a test to load?

It can vary from about 25 seconds to over a minute. If you leave your speed tab open, your test is still going to run. You can leave and return and still see your test results.

## I get a `403` response when rerunning the website analysis.
Check your firewall rules to make sure that you allow traffic from the Speed test to request your site.
