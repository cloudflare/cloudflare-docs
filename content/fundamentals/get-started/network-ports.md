## How to enable Cloudflare's proxy for additional ports

If traffic for your domain is destined for a different port than listed above, either:

- Add the subdomain as a [gray-clouded record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) via your Cloudflare DNS app, or
- Enable [Cloudflare Spectrum](/spectrum/get-started/).

Block traffic on ports other than 80 and 443 in Cloudflare paid plans by doing one of the following:

- If you are using [WAF managed rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172016), enable rule ID 100015: "Anomaly:Port - Non Standard Port (not 80 or 443)".
- If you are using the new [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/waf/), create a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) for this purpose (rule ID 100015 was deprecated in the new WAF). For example, you could use a rule configuration similar to the following:
  - Expression: `not (cf.edge.server_port in {80 443})`
  - Action: _Block_

Ports 80 and 443 are the only ports compatible with:

- HTTP/HTTPS traffic within China data centers for domains that have the **China Network** enabled, and
- Proxying of [Cloudflare Apps](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/getting-started)
- [Cloudflare Caching](/cache/get-started/)

{{<Aside type="note">}}

[Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/) does not support port numbers in URLs. Port numbers are stripped from requests for URLs protected through Cloudflare Access.
