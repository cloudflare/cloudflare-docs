# What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a global network of [servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/edge-server/). When you add your application to Cloudflare, we use this network to sit in between requests and your [origin server](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/origin-server/).
