# What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a global network of [servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/edge-server/). When you add your application to Cloudflare, we use this network to sit in between requests and your [origin server](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/origin-server/).

This [position](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) allows us to do several things — speeding up content delivery and user experience ([CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/)), protecting your website from malicious activity ([DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), [Firewall](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/)), routing traffic ([Load balancing](/load-balancing/), [Waiting Room](/waiting-room/)), and more.
