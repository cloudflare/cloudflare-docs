# What is Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is one of the world’s largest networks of [edge servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/edge-server/).

When you add your domain to Cloudflare, we use this edge network to sit in between website visitors and your [origin server](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/origin-server/).

This [position](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) allows us to do several things — speeding up content delivery and user experience ([CDN](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/cdn/)), protecting your website from malicious activity ([DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/), [Firewall](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/)), routing traffic ([Load balancing](/load-balancing/), [Waiting room](/waiting-room/)), and more.
