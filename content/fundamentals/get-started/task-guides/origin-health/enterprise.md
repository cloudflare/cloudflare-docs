# Protect your origin server — Enterprise

{{<render file="_origin-health-overview.md">}}

## Secure origin connections

{{<render file="_origin-secure-dns.md">}}
- **SSL**:
  - To encrypt all traffic between Cloudflare and your server, [choose Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull)](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/ssl-only-origin-pull/) SSL/TLS mode (requires server configuration)
  - To validate requests are coming from the Cloudflare network, [set up authenticated origin pulls](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/).
- **Prevent external connections**:
  - **Origin Server** (moderately secure): Configure your origin server to [only allow traffic from Cloudflare IP addresses](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/allow-cloudflare-ip-addresses/#configure-origin-server).
  - **Cloudflare Tunnel** (very secure): To encrypt all traffic and prevent any inbound connections to your origin, [set up a Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/).

## Monitor origin health

For passive monitoring, [create notifications](/fundamentals/notifications/create-notifications/) for **Origin Error Rate Alerts** to receive alerts when your origin returns 5xx codes above a configurable threshold and **Passive Origin Monitoring** to see when Cloudflare is unable to reach your origin for a few minutes.
