# Secure your website

Cloudflare offers several tools to protect your website against malicious traffic and bad actors.

## Protection options

### Default protection

As long as your traffic is [proxied by Cloudflare](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/), Cloudflare automatically protects your application from [DDoS attacks](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172676).

Cloudflare also issues and renews free, unshared, publicly trusted [SSL/TLS certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) to all Cloudflare domains.

### One-click protection

For customers on a **Pro** plan or above, Cloudflare offers several [Managed Rulesets](/waf/managed-rulesets/) as part of the Web Application Firewall (WAF).

All customers also have the options to adjust the following **Security** settings:
- [Security level](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170056): Use the IP reputation of a visitor to determine whether to present a [Managed Challenge](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc//articles/200170136#managed-challenge) page.
- [Challenge Passage](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170136#2dwCrNWIMnNJDP6AVjEQ3e): Specify the length of time that a visitor can access your website after completing a security challenge.
- [Browser Integrity Check](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170086): Evaluate incoming HTTP headers based on known threats — such as requests with a missing or non-standard user agent — and present a challenge page if needed.
- [Privacy Pass Support](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001992652): Reduce the number of challenges presented to visitors using the **Privacy Pass** browser extension.

### Protection with minimal setup

Based on additional knowledge about your website traffic and requirements, you can also:

- Enable [bot protection](/bots/get-started/).
- Set up various **Security** rules:
    - [Firewall rules](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/) block, challenge, or allow requests based on [several characteristics](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/) (user agents, cookies, referrer, and more).
    - [Rate limiting rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001635128) (usage-based billing) block IP addresses based on a URL pattern and defined request threshold.
    - [IP Access rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/217074967) block, challenge, or allow requests based on IP address, IP range, country, or ASN.
    - [User Agent Blocking rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001856951) block or challenge specific requests based on the associated user agent value.
    - [Zone Lockdown rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001595131) (customers on a Pro plan or higher) specify a list of IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or networks that are allowed to access a particular domain, subdomain, or URL.
- Further customize [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/waf/) and [DDoS Protection](/ddos-protection/) settings.
- Create [forwarding URLs](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/4729826525965) to prevent access to specify URLs, request schemes, file types, subdomains, or directories by redirecting users to a safe location.
- Restrict access to documents, files, and media by configuring [Token Authentication](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115001376488).

### Dedicated products
