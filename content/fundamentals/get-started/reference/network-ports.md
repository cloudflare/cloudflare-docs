## How to enable Cloudflare's proxy for additional ports

If traffic for your domain is destined for a different port than the ones listed above, for example you have an SSH server that listens for incoming connections on port 22, either:

- Change your subdomain to be [gray-clouded](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/), via your Cloudflare DNS app, to bypass the Cloudflare network and connect directly to your origin.
- Configure a [Spectrum application](/spectrum/get-started/) for the hostname running the server. Spectrum supports all ports. Spectrum for all TCP and UDP ports is only available on the Enterprise plan. If you would like to know more about Cloudflare plans, please reach out to your Cloudflare account team.

## How to block traffic on additional ports

Block traffic on ports other than 80 and 443 in Cloudflare paid plans by doing one of the following:

- If you are using [WAF managed rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172016), enable rule ID 100015: "Anomaly:Port - Non Standard Port (not 80 or 443)".
- If you are using the new [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/waf/), create a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) for this purpose (rule ID 100015 was deprecated in the new WAF). For example, you could use a rule configuration similar to the following:

  - Expression: `not (cf.edge.server_port in {80 443})`
  - Action: _Block_

Ports 80 and 443 are the only ports compatible with:

- HTTP/HTTPS traffic within China data centers for domains that have the **China Network** enabled, and
- Proxying of [Cloudflare Apps](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/getting-started)

{{<render file="_open-ports-blocked-traffic.md" productFolder="firewall" >}}

WAF managed rules or the new Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) will block traffic at the application layer (layer 7 in the [OSI model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)), preventing HTTP/HTTPS requests over non-standard ports from reaching the origin server.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

[Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/) does not support port numbers in URLs. Port numbers are stripped from requests for URLs protected through Cloudflare Access.
