# Minimize downtime

When you [add your domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare, it may experience a brief period of downtime due to certificate issuance, misconfigured Cloudflare settings, or limitations at your origin server.

## Step 1 — Update and review DNS records

Before activating your domain on Cloudflare (exact steps depend on your [DNS setup](/dns/zone-setups/)), review the DNS records in your Cloudflare account.

### Start with unproxied records

With a new domain, make sure all your DNS records have a [proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) of **DNS-only**. 

This setting prevents Cloudflare from proxying your traffic before you have an active edge certificate or before you have allowed Cloudflare IP addresses.

### Confirm record accuracy

Take extra time to confirm the accuracy of your DNS records before activating your domain, paying special attention to:

- [Root domain records (`example.com`)](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-root-domain/)
- [Subdomain records (`www.example.com` or `blog.example.com`)](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-subdomain/)
- [Email records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/email-records/)

If you add DNS records to your authoritative DNS provider between onboarding your domain and activating your domain, you may need to also add these records within Cloudflare.

## Step 2 — Activate your domain

Finish the [DNS setup](/dns/zone-setups/) for your domain, moving the [domain status](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) to **Active**:

- [Full setups](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/): Update the authoritative nameservers at your registrar and wait for that change to be authenticated.
- [Partial setups](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/): Add the verification TXT record to your authoritative DNS and wait for that change to be authenticated.

## Step 3 — Verify SSL/TLS edge certificates

Before proxying your traffic through Cloudflare, [verify](/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/#monitor-certificate-statuses) that Cloudflare has an active **Edge Certificate** for your domain.

For more details about timing and certificate recommendations, refer to [Certificate issuance](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/enable-universal-ssl/#full-dns-setup).

## Step 4 — Test configuration (optional)

You may want to test your configuration using your local machine or proxying traffic from a development domain or subdomain.

If you experience issues, you should make sure that you have [allowed Cloudflare IP addresses](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/allow-cloudflare-ip-addresses/) at your origin server.

## Step 5 — Update proxy status

Once you have verified that your SSL/TLS edge certificate is active and you have allowed Cloudflare IP addresses, change the [proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) of appropriate DNS records to **Proxied**.
