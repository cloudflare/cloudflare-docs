# How to interact with Cloudflare

Once you [set up an account](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/), you have several ways to interact with Cloudflare.

## Without code

If you prefer working without code, you can manage your account and domain settings through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If your domain was added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.

## With code

For those who prefer to interact with Cloudflare programmatically, you can use several methods:
