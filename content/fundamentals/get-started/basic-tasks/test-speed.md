# Test speed

Cloudflare offers several tools to test the speed of your website, as well as the speed of your Internet connection.

---

## Test website speed

Once your domain is [active on Cloudflare](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/), you can run speed tests within the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/speed).

This speed test will provide information about critical loading times, performance with and without [Cloudflare's proxy](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/), and recommended optimizations.

If you experience any issues, make sure you are not blocking specific [user agents](/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-site-crawling/#other-situations).

For more details on using external tools to measure website speed, refer to [Troubleshooting site speed](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/5550125973005).
