# Find zone and account IDs

Once you [set up a new account](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/account-setup/) and [add your domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare, you may need access to your zone and account IDs for API operations.

To find your zone and account IDs:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. On the **Overview** page (the landing page for your domain), find the **API** section.

3. The **API** section contains your **Zone ID** and **Account ID**. To copy these values for API commands or other tasks, click **Click to copy**.
