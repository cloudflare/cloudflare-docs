# Update billing information

To avoid potential disruptions in your Cloudflare services, make sure your billing information is current and accurate. It is also important to understand [how Cloudflare plans and add-ons are priced](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/#overview).

To access your current payment methods (primary and backup) select **Billing** > **Payment Info** in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Your billing address can either be associated with your **Payment Method** or your business' physical address. It will be used to calculate your sales tax (if applicable). 

To include your business' information in your invoices, you must include **Billing address**, **Company name**, and **VAT/GST number** (if applicable) in your Payment method section.

If Cloudflare is unable to process your payment, review [Troubleshooting failed payments](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218344877).

## Add or update payment methods

A primary payment method is required to process payment for Cloudflare products and services. We value your confidentiality and privacy - Cloudflare does not have access to your bank, credit card, pin, or PayPal account password details.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Customers in the Enterprise plan have additional payment options such as wire and ACH as well as yearly or quarterly billing. To discuss upgrading to Enterprise, [contact us](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/).

{{</Aside>}}

To add or update your primary payment method,

1. Log in to the Cloudfare dashboard.

2. Select **Choose account** > **Manage account** > **Billling**.

3. On the left navigation, select **Payment Info***.

4. If there is no payment method on file, the **Payment Method** dialog opens automatically. Otherwise, select **Manage** next to your current payment method and the **Payment Method** dialog opens.

5. Enter the required information based on the payment options below:
    * If paying by credit card:
        * Enter all the information required under the **Credit Card Details** form.
        * To add your business' information to your invoice, include your **Company** and **VAT/GST Number**, if applicable.

    * If paying by PayPal (will charge your credit card if you do not have enough funds in your Paypal account):
        * Select the **Paypal logo** on the upper right.
        * Follow the online instructions until PayPal returns you to Cloudflare **Payment Method** dialog where you can continue with your set-up.
        * Verify that your **PayPal username** now appears next to the **PayPal logo**.
        * Add your account contact information as well as **Company** and **VAT/GST Number**, if applicable.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Because some countries charge tax goods and services on personal accounts, you may be asked to indicate whether your Cloudflare account is personal or business to determine tax eligibility.

6. Review the payment method and contact information to ensure it is accurate.

7. To finish, select **Confirm**.

Ensure your new payment method now appears in the **Payment Method** section.

## Add a backup payment method

A backup payment method is used if the primary payment method fails. To add a backup payment method:

1. Log in to the Cloudfare dashboard.

2. Select **Choose account** > **Manage account** > **Billling**.

3. On the left nagivation, select **Payment Info***.

4. Select **Manage**.

5. In the **Backup** card, select **Add** to enter a backup payment method.

6. Enter the required information based on your preferred payment method (credit card or PayPal) and select **Confirm**.

7. If you would like to make the backup payment method the primary method, select **Make primary payment method** in the **Backup** card.

## Delete your current payment method

Before removing your payment method from file, you must cancel all Cloudflare paid services.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

If you currently subscribe to any add-on services, Cloudflare must always have a payment method on file. If you need to remove a payment method, then you must enter a new one to replace it. Otherwise, you will see an error.

You also cannot delete your payment method if a payment fails or if there is an outstanding balance. Until we process payment, you can only add or edit your payment method.

{{</Aside>}}

To delete your current payment method:

1. Log in to the Cloudfare dashboard.

2. Select **Choose account** > **Manage account** > **Billling**.

3. On the left navigation, select **Payment Info***.

4. Next to your current payment method, select **Delete**.

5. Select **Confirm** to finish.

Now, the **Payment Method** dialog should appear in the **Payment Method** section, where you can enter new payment details.

## Update your billing address

The billing address is associated with your **Payment Method** and is used to calculate your sales tax. If you need to update your billing address, you must also enter you **Payment Method**. The process for updating your billing address depends on the **Payment Method**.

If paying by credit card:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

2. Select **Choose account** > **Manage account** > **Billling**.

3. Ensure that you have selected the account for which you want to update your payment address.

4. On the left navigation, select **Payment Info**.

5. In the **Payment Method** section, select **Edit**.

6. Enter your credit card deatils and new billing address in the **Payment Method** dialog. Include a **Company name** and **VAT/GST number** (if applicable) if you would like your company's information on your invoice.

7. Review the suggested address in the pop-up window. If the information is correct, select **Confirm**. If not, select **Edit this address** to return to the **Payment Method** dialog.

If paying by Paypal, refer to PayPal's [billing address documentation](https://www.paypal.com/ai/smarthelp/article/how-do-i-edit-the-billing-address-linked-to-my-credit-card-faq680).
