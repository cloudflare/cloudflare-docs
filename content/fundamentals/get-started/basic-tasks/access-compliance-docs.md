# Access compliance documentation

Super Administrators can access common compliance documentation — for topics like PCI, SOC 2, ISO, and more — through the Cloudflare dashboard.

To access compliance documentation:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account where you are a **Super Administrator**.
2. Go to **Support** > **Compliance Documents**.
3. If you have not accessed this page before, read the confidentiality statement and click **I Agree**.
4. For any documents you need, click **Download**.

For confidentiality purposes, only **Super Administrators** for an account can access compliance documentation.
