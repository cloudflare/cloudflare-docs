# Standard Library

Workers written in Python are executed by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html).

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly — for the most part it behaves identically to [CPython](https://github.com/python) (the reference implementation of Python — commonly referred to as just "Python"). The majority of the CPython test suite passes when run against Pyodide. For the most part, you shouldn't need to worry about differences in behavior.

The full [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) is available in Python Workers, with the following exceptions:

## Modules with limited functionality

- `hashlib`: Hash algorithms that depend on OpenSSL are not available by default.
  See Python [hashlib documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html)
  for list of algorithms that are dependent on OpenSSL.

- `decimal`: The decimal module has C (\_decimal) and Python (\_pydecimal) implementations
  with the same functionality. Only the C implementation is available.

- `pydoc`: Help messages for Python builtins are not available by default
  in order to reduce the initial download size.
  TODO — what do we do here?

- `webbrowser`: The original webbrowser module is not available.
  TODO — none of this makes sense in context of workers (without integration with browser workers — remove?)

### Excluded modules

The following modules are not available in Python Workers:

- curses
- dbm
- ensurepip
- fcntl
- grp
- idlelib
- lib2to3
- msvcrt
- pwd
- resource
- syslog
- termios
- tkinter
- turtle.py
- turtledemo
- venv
- winreg
- winsound

The following modules can be imported, but are not functional due to the limitations of the WebAssembly VM.

- multiprocessing
- threading
- sockets

TODO: We removed — correct? So can just remove this section and move these to "excluded modules"?


The following are present but cannot be imported due to a dependency on the termios package which has been removed:

- pty
- tty

TODO: We removed – correct? (so can move this to just "excluded modules")
