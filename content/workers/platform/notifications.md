# Usage notifications

Cloudflare provides two kinds of usage notifications: Workers Weekly Summary and Workers Usage Report. These reports are automatically enabled when you create a new free account with Workers.

## Workers Weekly Summary

Workers Weekly Summary provides a breakdown of your overall Workers usage for your most popular Workers.

## Workers Usage Report

Workers Usage Report is an on-demand usage notification that is triggered when a Worker's CPU usage is 25% above its average CPU usage over the previous seven days.
