# Start from worker

Workers Sites require [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) — make sure to use the [latest version](/workers/wrangler/getting-started/#update).

If you have a pre-existing Worker project, you can use Workers Sites to serve static assets to the Worker. To do so, follow these instructions:

1.  Create a directory in the root of your project (for example, `workers-site`) and add configuration to your `wrangler.toml` file to point to it. Add the path to your Worker script (probably `index.js`).

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
# ... (whatever you already have here)

[site]
bucket = "./my-dir" # Add the directory with your static assets!
entry-point = "./workers-site" # JS folder serving your assets
```

2.  Add the `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` package to your project:

```sh
$ npm i @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler
```

3.  Import the package’s code into your Worker script and invoke it within your function handler to respond with static assets:

```js
import { getAssetFromKV } from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler";

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleEvent(event));
});

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    return await getAssetFromKV(event);
  } catch (e) {
    let pathname = new URL(event.request.url).pathname;
    return new Response(`"${pathname}" not found`, {
      status: 404,
      statusText: "not found",
    });
  }
}
```

For more information on the configurable options of `getAssetFromKV` refer to [the template’s source](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template/blob/master/workers-site/index.js).

4.  Run `preview` or `publish` as you would normally with your Worker project.

```sh
$ wrangler publish
```
