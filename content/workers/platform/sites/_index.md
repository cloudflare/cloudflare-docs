# Workers Sites

{{<Aside type="note" header="Cloudflare Pages">}}
Consider using [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/) for hosting static applications instead of Workers Sites.
{{</Aside>}}

Workers Sites enables developers to deploy static applications directly to Workers. It can be used for deploying applications built with static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), or front-end frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).
