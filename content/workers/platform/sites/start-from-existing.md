# Start from existing

Workers Sites require [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2) — make sure to use the [latest version](/workers/wrangler/getting-started/#update).

To deploy a pre-existing static site project, start with a pre-generated site. Workers Sites works well with all static site generators. For a quick-start, review the following projects:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/), requires Node
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), requires Ruby
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/#quick-start), requires Node
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (refer to the tutorial on [deploying static WordPress sites with Workers](/workers/tutorials/deploy-a-static-wordpress-site/))

After you have generated a site, follow these steps:

1.  Run this Wrangler command in the root of your project’s directory:

```sh
$ wrangler init --site my-static-site
```

This command creates a few things: a `wrangler.toml` file and a `workers-site` directory.

2.  Add your site’s build directory to the `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
[site]
bucket = "./public" # <-- Add your build directory name here.
entry-point = "workers-site"
```

The default directories for the most popular static site generators are listed below:

    - Hugo: `public`
    - Gatsby: `public`
    - Jekyll: `_site`
    - Eleventy: `_site`

3\. Add your `account_id` to your `wrangler.toml`. You can find your `account_id` by logging in to the Cloudflare dashboard **Account Home** > **choose your website** > **Overview** > **Account ID** For more details on finding your `account_id`, refer to the [Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/#6a-obtaining-your-account-id-and-zone-id).

4.  You can preview your site by running:

```sh
$ wrangler dev
```

5.  Decide if you would like to publish your site to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/get-started/guide/#configure-for-deploying-to-workersdev) or a [custom domain](/workers/get-started/guide/#optional-configure-for-deploying-to-a-registered-domain) that you own and have already attached as a Cloudflare zone.

Then update your `wrangler.toml`:

**Personal Domain**: Add your `zone_id` and a `route`.

```toml
zone_id = "42ef.."
route = "example.com/*"
```

**`*.workers.dev`**: Set `workers_dev` to true. This is the default.

6.  Run:

```sh
$ wrangler publish
```
