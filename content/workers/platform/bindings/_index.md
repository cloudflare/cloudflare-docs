## About Bindings

Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Workers platform. Bindings can be configured in [**Workers**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?zone=workers) > your **Worker** > **Settings**> **Variables**.

There are multiple types of bindings available today:

1. [Service bindings](./service-bindings) for communication with another Worker
2. KV Namespace bindings
3. R2 Bucket bindings
4. Durable Object bindings
