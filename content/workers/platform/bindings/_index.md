## About Bindings

Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Workers platform. Bindings can be configured by logging in to the Cloudflare dashboard > Account Home > [**Workers**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?zone=workers) > your **Worker** > **Settings**> **Variables**.

There are multiple types of bindings available today:

1. [Service bindings](/workers/platform/bindings/about-service-bindings/) for communication with another Worker.
2. KV namespace bindings for communication between a Worker and a KV namespace.
3. R2 bucket bindings for communication between a Worker and an R2 bucket.
4. Durable Object bindings for communication between a Worker and a Durable Object.
