# Environments

## Background

Wrangler allows you to deploy the same Worker application with different configuration for each environment. You must configure environments in your Worker application's `wrangler.toml` file.

Review the following environments flow:

1. You have created a Worker application named `my-worker`.
2. You create an environment, for example, `dev`, in the Worker's `wrangler.toml` configuration file.
3. In `wrangler.toml`, you configure the `dev` environment by [adding bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) and/or [routes](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/).
4. You deploy the Worker using `npx wrangler deploy -e dev`.
5. In the background, Wrangler creates a new Worker named `my-worker-dev`.
6. You can now change your `my-worker` Worker code and configuration, and choose which environment to deploy your changes to.

Environments are used with the `--env` or `-e` flag on `wrangler dev`, `npx wrangler deploy`, and `wrangler secret`.

## Configuration

To create an environment:

1. Open your Worker's `wrangler.toml` file.
2. Add `[env.<NAME>]` and change `<NAME>` to the desired name of your environment.
3. Repeat step 2 to create multiple environments.

Be careful when naming your environments that they do not contain sensitive information, such as, `migrating-service-from-company1-to-company2` or `company1-acquisition-load-test`.

Review the layout of an example `[env.dev]` environment that sets up a custom `dev.example.com` route:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "your-worker"
route = "example.com"

[env.dev]
route = "dev.example.com"
```

You cannot specify multiple environments with the same name.

Wrangler appends the environment name to the top-level name to deploy a Worker. For example, a Worker project named `my-worker` with an environment `[env.dev]` would deploy a Worker named `my-worker-dev`.

After you have configured your environment, run `npx wrangler deploy` in your Worker project directory for the changes to take effect.

## Non-inheritable keys and environments

[Non-inheritable keys](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#non-inheritable-keys) are configurable at the top-level, but cannot be inherited by environments and must be specified for each environment.

[Bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) and [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) must be specified per each [environment](/workers/wrangler/environments/) in your [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) file.

Review the following example `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "my-worker"

vars = { API_HOST = "example.com" }

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "<BINDING_NAME>", id = "<KV_NAMESPACE_ID_DEV>" }
]

[env.production]

vars = { API_HOST = "production.example.com" }

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "<BINDING_NAME>", id = "<KV_NAMESPACE_ID_PRODUCTION>" }
]
```

You may assign environment-specific [secrets](/workers/configuration/secrets/) by running the command [`wrangler secret put <KEY> -env`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#put-3).

## Examples

### Staging and production environments

The following `wrangler.toml` file adds two environments, `[env.staging]` and `[env.production]`, to the `wrangler.toml` file. If you are deploying to a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) or [route](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/), you must provide a [`route` or `routes` key](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) for each environment.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "my-worker"
route = "dev.example.com/*"
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "dev" }

[env.staging]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "staging" }
route = "staging.example.com/*"

[env.production]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "production" }
routes = [
  "example.com/foo/*",
  "example.com/bar/*"
]
```

In order to use environments with this configuration, you can pass the name of the environment via the `--env` flag.

With this configuration, Wrangler will behave in the following manner:

```sh
~/my-worker $ npx wrangler deploy
Uploaded my-worker
Published my-worker
  dev.example.com/*
```

```sh
~/my-worker $ npx wrangler deploy --env staging
Uploaded my-worker-staging
Published my-worker-staging
  staging.example.com/*
```

```sh
~/my-worker $ npx wrangler deploy --env production
Uploaded my-worker-production
Published my-worker-production
  example.com/*
```

Any defined [environment variables](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) (the [`vars`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) key) are exposed as global variables to your Worker.

With this configuration, the `ENVIRONMENT` variable can be used to call specific code depending on the given environment:

```js
if (ENVIRONMENT === "staging") {
  // staging-specific code
} else if (ENVIRONMENT === "production") {
  // production-specific code
}
```

### Staging environment with \*.workers.dev

To deploy your code to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain, include `workers_dev = true` in the desired environment. Your `wrangler.toml` file may look like this:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "my-worker"
route = "example.com/*"

[env.staging]
workers_dev = true
```

With this configuration, Wrangler will behave in the following manner:

```sh
~/my-worker $ npx wrangler deploy
Uploaded my-worker
Published my-worker
  example.com/*
```

```sh
~/my-worker $ npx wrangler deploy --env staging
Uploaded my-worker
Published my-worker
  https://my-worker-staging.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

When you create a Worker via an environment, Cloudflare automatically creates an SSL certification for it. SSL certifications are discoverable and a matter of public record.
