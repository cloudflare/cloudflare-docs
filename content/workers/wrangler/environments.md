## Environments

{{<Aside type="note">}}

We have temporarily disabled the creation of Service Environments while we are improving this feature.

{{</Aside>}}

Wrangler 2 supports [environments](/workers/platform/environments/) from Wrangler 1. We are currently working on support for [Service Environments](/workers/learning/using-services/). Refer to the documentation on [Wrangler 1 legacy environments](/workers/platform/environments/) for more information.
