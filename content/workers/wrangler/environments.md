## Environments

{{<Aside type="note">}}

We've temporarily disabled the creation of Service Environments while we are improving this feature.

Wrangler 2 supports [environments](/workers/platform/environments/) from wrangler 1. We are currently working on support for [Service Environments](/workers/learning/using-services/). You can find the documentation on Wrangler 1 legacy environments [here](/workers/platform/environments/).
