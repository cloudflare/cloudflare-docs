# Environments

{{<Aside type="note">}}

We have temporarily disabled the creation of Service Environments while we are improving this feature.

Wrangler 2 supports [environments](/workers/platform/environments/) from Wrangler 1. We are currently working on support for [Service Environments](/workers/learning/using-services/).  Refer to the [Wrangler 1 environments](/workers/platform/environments/) for more information.
