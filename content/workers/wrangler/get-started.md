# Get started with Wrangler

Wrangler is a command-line tool for building [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Wrangler has launched a new version. If you are looking for the Wrangler 1 documentation, you can find it [here](/workers/wrangler/cli-wrangler/install-update/).

If you previously had Wrangler 1 installed or were working on a Wrangler 1 project, refer to the [Migration guide](/workers/wrangler/migration/migrating-from-wrangler-1/).

## Install

Installing Wrangler, the Workers CLI, allows you to [`init`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#init), [`dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev), and [`publish`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#publish) your Workers projects.

To install [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2), ensure you have [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Wrangler requires a Node version of `16.13.0` or later.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Consider using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Using a version manager helps avoid permission issues and allows you to easily change Node.js versions.

Then run:

```sh
$ npm install -g wrangler
```

or install with `yarn`:

```sh
$ yarn global add wrangler
```

To check your Wrangler version, run:

```sh
$ wrangler --version
```

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you do not want to install Wrangler globally, you can use the [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) command. For example: `npx wrangler init`.

## Authenticate

With installation complete, Wrangler will need access to a Cloudflare OAuth token to manage Workers resources on your behalf.

Run the command `wrangler login`, which will automate this process.

Wrangler will attempt to automatically open your web browser to complete the login process to your Cloudflare account. If you have issues completing this step or you do not have access to a browser GUI, you can copy and paste the URL generated by `wrangler login` in your terminal into a browser and log in.

```sh
$ wrangler login
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.0.7
-----------------------------------------------------
Attempting to login via OAuth...
Successfully logged in.
```

If you prefer to use API tokens for authentication, such as in headless or continuous integration environments, refer to [Running Wrangler in CI/CD](/workers/wrangler/ci-cd/).

Open the browser, log in to your account, and select **Allow**. This will send an OAuth Token to Wrangler so it can deploy your scripts to Cloudflare.

### Use `wrangler login` on a remote machine

If you are using Wrangler from a remote machine, but run the login flow from your local browser, you will receive the following error message after logging in:`This site can't be reached`.

To finish the login flow, run `wrangler login` and go through the login flow in the browser:

```sh
$ wrangler login
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.1.6
-------------------
Attempting to login via OAuth...
Opening a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/oauth2/auth?xyz...
```

Leave the login flow active. Open a second terminal session. In that second terminal session, use `curl` or an equivalent request library on the remote machine to fetch this `localhost` URL:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8976/oauth/callback?code=xyz...
```

## Update

To update Wrangler, run:

```sh
$ npm -g install wrangler@latest
```

Note that this command will not update Wrangler in projects where it is already installed. If you already have a `package.json` in your directory with Wrangler installed, run:

```sh
$ npm update wrangler --save
```

With Wrangler successfully installed, refer to [Commands](/workers/wrangler/commands/) and [Configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to continue building with Wrangler.
