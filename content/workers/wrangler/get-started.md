Wrangler has launched a new version. If you are looking for the Wrangler 1 documentation, you can find it [here](/workers/wrangler/cli-wrangler/install-update/).

{{</Aside>}}

## Get started with Wrangler

`wrangler` is a command line tool for building [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

## 1. Install the Workers CLI

Installing `wrangler`, the Workers CLI, allows you to [`init`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#init), [`dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev), and [`publish`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#publish) your Workers projects.

To install [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2), ensure you have [`npm` installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues or to easily change Node.js versions, then run:

```sh
$ npm install -g wrangler
```

or install with yarn:

```sh
$ yarn global add wrangler
```

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you previously had Wrangler 1 installed or were working on a Wrangler 1 project, refer to the [Migration guide](/workers/wrangler/migration/migrating-from-wrangler-1/).

{{</Aside>}}

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you do not want to install Wrangler globally, you can use the [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) command. For example: `npx wrangler init`.

## 2. Authenticate

With installation complete, `wrangler` will need access to a Cloudflare OAuth token to manage Workers resources on your behalf.

Run the command `wrangler login`, which will automate this process.

Wrangler will attempt to automatically open your web browser to complete the login process to your Cloudflare account. If you have issues completing this step or you do not have access to a browser GUI, you can copy and paste the URL generated by `wrangler login` in your terminal into a browser and log in.

```sh
$ wrangler login
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.0.7
-----------------------------------------------------
Attempting to login via OAuth...
Successfully logged in.
```

Open the browser, log in to your account, and select **Allow**. This will send an OAuth Token to Wrangler so it can deploy your scripts to Cloudflare.
