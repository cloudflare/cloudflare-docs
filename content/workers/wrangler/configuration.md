# Configure `wrangler.toml`

Wrangler optionally uses a `wrangler.toml` configuration file to customize the development and publishing setup for a Worker. This document serves as a reference for all the fields and acceptable values in this configuration file.

The configuration for a Worker can become complex when you can define different [environments](/workers/platform/environments/), and each environment has its own configuration.
There is a default (top-level) environment and named environments that provide environment-specific configuration.

```toml

name = "worker"

# The entrypoint/path to the file that will be executed.

# This is the ID of the account associated with your zone.
# You might have more than one account, so make sure to use
# the ID of the account associated with the zone/route you
# provide, if you provide one. It can also be specified through

# For newly created Workers, if the Usage Model is omitted
# it will be set to the [default Usage Model set on the account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?account=workers/default-usage-model).
