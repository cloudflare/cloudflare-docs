# Create a fine-tuned OpenAI model with R2

{{<tutorial-date-info>}}

In this tutorial, you will use the [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API and [Cloudflare R2](/r2) to create a [fine-tuned model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning).

This feature in OpenAI's API allows you to derive a custom model from OpenAI's various large language models based on a set of custom instructions and example answers. These instructions and example answers are written in a document, known as a fine-tune document. This document will be stored in R2 and dynamically provided to OpenAI's APIs when creating a new fine-tune model.

In order to use this feature, you will do the following tasks:

1. Upload a fine-tune document to R2.
2. Read the R2 file and upload it to OpenAI.
3. Create a new fine-tuned model based on the document.

To review the completed code for this application, refer to the [GitHub repository for this tutorial](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/openai-finetune-r2-example).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A Cloudflare account with access to R2. If you do not have a Cloudflare account, [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) before continuing. Then purchase R2 from your Cloudflare dashboard.
- An OpenAI API key.
- A fine-tune document, structured as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/). Use the [example document](https://github.com/kristianfreeman/openai-finetune-r2-example/blob/16ca53ca9c8589834abe317487eeedb8a24c7643/example_data.jsonl) in the source code.

## 1. Create a Worker application

First, use the `c3` CLI to create a new Cloudflare Workers project.

{{<render file="_c3-run-command-with-directory.md" productFolder="workers" withParameters="finetune-chatgpt-model">}}

{{<render file="_c3-post-run-steps.md" productFolder="workers" withParameters="Hello World example;;Hello World Worker;;TypeScript">}}

The above options will create the "Hello World" TypeScript project.

Move into your newly created directory:

```sh
$ cd finetune-chatgpt-model
```

## 2. Upload a fine-tune document to R2

Next, upload the fine-tune document to R2. R2 is a key-value store that allows you to store and retrieve files from within your Workers application. You will use [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler) to create a new R2 bucket.

To create a new R2 bucket use the [`wrangler r2 bucket create`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#create-2) command. Note that you are logged in with your Cloudflare account. If not logged in via Wrangler, use the [`wrangler login`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#login) command.

```sh
$ npx wrangler r2 bucket create <BUCKET_NAME>
```
Replace `<BUCKET_NAME>` with your desired bucket name. Note that bucket names must be lowercase and can only contain dashes.

Next, upload a file using the [`wrangler r2 object put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#put-2) command.

```sh
$ npx wrangler r2 object put <PATH> -f <FILE_NAME>
```

`<PATH>` is the combined bucket and file path of the file you want to upload -- for example, `fine-tune-ai/finetune.jsonl`, where `fine-tune-ai` is the bucket name. Replace `<FILE_NAME>` with the local filename of your fine-tune document.

## 3. Bind your bucket to the Worker

A binding is how your Worker interacts with external resources such as the R2 bucket.

To bind the R2 bucket to your Worker, add the following to your `wrangler.toml` file. Update the binding property to a valid JavaScript variable identifier. Replace `<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of the bucket you created in [step 2](#2-upload-a-fine-tune-document-to-r2):

```toml
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = 'MY_BUCKET' # <~ valid JavaScript variable name
bucket_name = '<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>'
```

## 4. Initialize your Worker application

You will use [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a lightweight framework for building Cloudflare Workers applications. Hono provides an interface for defining routes and middleware functions. Inside your project directory, run the following command to install Hono:

```sh
$ npm install hono
```

You also need to install the [OpenAI Node API library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai). This library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API in a Node.js project. To install the library, execute the following command:

```sh
$ npm install openai
```

Next, open the `src/index.ts` file and replace the default code with the below code. Replace `<MY_BUCKET>` with the binding name you set in `wrangler.toml` file.

```typescript
---
filename: src/index.ts
---
import { Context, Hono } from "hono";
import OpenAI from "openai";

type Bindings = {
	<MY_BUCKET>: R2Bucket
	OPENAI_API_KEY: string
}

type Variables = {
	openai: OpenAI
}

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings, Variables: Variables }>()

app.use('*', async (c, next) => {
	const openai = new OpenAI({
		apiKey: c.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
	})
	c.set("openai", openai)
	await next()
})

app.onError((err, c) => {
	return c.text(err.message, 500)
})

export default app;
```

In the above code, you first import the required packages and define the types. Then, you initialize `app` as a new Hono instance. Using the  `use` middleware function, you add the OpenAI API client to the context of all routes. This middleware function allows you to access the client from within any route handler. `onError()` defines an error handler to return any errors as a JSON response.

## 5. Read R2 files and upload them to OpenAI

In this section, you will define the route and function responsible for handling file uploads.

In `createFile`, your Worker reads the file from R2 and converts it to a `File` object. Your Worker then uses the OpenAI API to upload the file and return the response.

The `GET /files` route listens for `GET` requests with a query parameter `file`, representing a filename of an uploaded fine-tune document in R2. The function uses the `createFile` function to manage the file upload process.

Replace `<MY_BUCKET>` with the binding name you set in `wrangler.toml` file.

```typescript
---
filename: src/index.ts
---
// New import added at beginning of file
import { toFile } from 'openai/uploads'

const createFile = async (c: Context, r2Object: R2ObjectBody) => {
	const openai: OpenAI = c.get("openai")

	const blob = await r2Object.blob()
	const file = await toFile(blob, r2Object.key)

	const uploadedFile = await openai.files.create({
		file,
		purpose: "fine-tune",
	})

	return uploadedFile
}

app.get('/files', async c => {
	const fileQueryParam = c.req.query("file")
	if (!fileQueryParam) return c.text("Missing file query param", 400)

	const file = await c.env.<MY_BUCKET>.get(fileQueryParam)
	if (!file) return c.text("Couldn't find file", 400)

	const uploadedFile = await createFile(c, file)
	return c.json(uploadedFile)
})
```

## 6. Create fine-tuned models

This section includes the `GET /models` route and the `createModel` function. The function `createModel` takes care of specifying the details and initiating the fine-tuning process with OpenAI. The route handles incoming requests for creating a new fine-tuned model.

```typescript
---
filename: src/index.ts
---
const createModel = async (c: Context, fileId: string) => {
	const openai: OpenAI = c.get("openai")

	const body = {
		training_file: fileId,
		model: "gpt-4o-mini",
	}

	return openai.fineTuning.jobs.create(body)
}

app.get('/models', async c => {
	const fileId = c.req.query("file_id")
	if (!fileId) return c.text("Missing file ID query param", 400)

	const model = await createModel(c, fileId)
	return c.json(model)
})
```

## 7. List all fine-tune jobs

This section describes the `GET /jobs` route and the corresponding `getJobs` function. The function interacts with OpenAI's API to fetch a list of all fine-tuning jobs. The route provides an interface for retrieving this information.

```typescript
---
filename: src/index.ts
---
const getJobs = async (c: Context) => {
	const openai: OpenAI = c.get("openai")
	const resp = await openai.fineTuning.jobs.list()
	return resp.data
}

app.get('/jobs', async c => {
	const jobs = await getJobs(c)
	return c.json(jobs)
})
```

## 8. Deploy your application

After you have created your Worker application and added the required functions, deploy the application.

Before you deploy, you must set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` [secret](/workers/configuration/secrets/) for your application. Do this by running the [`wrangler secret put`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#put-3) command:

```sh
$ npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

To deploy your Worker application to the Cloudflare global network:

1. Make sure you are in your Worker project's directory, then run the [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) command:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy
```

2. Wrangler will package and upload your code.

3. After your application is deployed, Wrangler will provide you with your Worker's URL.


## 9. View the fine-tune job status and use the model

To use your application, create a new fine-tune job by making a request to the `/files` with a `file` query param matching the filename you uploaded earlier:

```sh
$ curl https://your-worker-url.com/files?file=finetune.jsonl
```

When the file is uploaded, issue another request to `/models`, passing the `file_id` query parameter. This should match the `id` returned as JSON from the `/files` route:

```sh
$ curl https://your-worker-url.com/models?file_id=file-abc123
```

Finally, visit `/jobs` to see the status of your fine-tune jobs in OpenAI. Once the fine-tune job has completed, you can see the `fine_tuned_model` value, indicating a fine-tuned model has been created.

Visit the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) in order to use your fine-tune model. Select your fine-tune model from the top-left dropdown of the interface.

![Demo](/images/workers/tutorials/finetune/finetune-example.png)

Use it in any API requests you make to OpenAI's chat completions endpoints. For instance, in the below code example:

```javascript
openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." }],
  model: "ft:gpt-4o-mini:my-org:custom_suffix:id",
});
```
