# Deploy a real-time chat application

In this tutorial, you will build a serverless, real-time chat application that runs using [Durable Objects](/workers/learning/using-durable-objects.md/using-durable-objects). 

To continue with this tutorial, you must:
1. Install [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/get-started.md).
2. Purchase the Workers Paid plan and enable Durable Objects by logging into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) > **Workers** > **Resources** > **Durable Objects**.

## Clone the chat application repository

Open your terminal and clone the [workers-chat-demo](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo) repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo.git
```

## Authenticate Wrangler

After you have cloned the repository, authenticate Wrangler by running:

```sh
$ wrangler login
```

## Publish your project

Open the cloned workers-chat-demo repository. To test the chat application in a local environemnt, run:

```sh
$ wrangler dev
```

When you are ready to deploy your application, run:

```sh
$ wrangler publish
```

Your application will be deployed to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain. 

To deploy your application to a custom domain within the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your Worker > **Triggers** > **Add Custom Domain**.

To deploy your application to a custom domain using Wrangler, open your project's `wrangler.toml`.

To configure a route in your `wrangler.toml`, add the following to your environment:

```toml
Route = [
{pattern = ‚Äúexample.com/about‚Äù, 
Zone_id = <YOUR_ZONE_ID>,
}]
```

If you have specified your zone ID in the environment of your `wrangler.toml`, you will not need to write it again in object form.

To configure a subdomain in your `wrangler.toml`, add the following to your environment:

```toml
Route = [
{pattern = ‚Äúsubdomain.example.com‚Äù, 
custom domains = true,
}]
```
