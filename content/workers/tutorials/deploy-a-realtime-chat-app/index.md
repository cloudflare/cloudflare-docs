# Deploy a real-time chat application

{{<tutorial-date-info>}}

In this tutorial, you will deploy a serverless, real-time chat application that runs using [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/).

This chat application uses a Durable Object to control each chat room. Users connect to the Object using WebSockets. Messages from one user are broadcast to all the other users. The chat history is also stored in durable storage. Real-time messages are relayed directly from one user to others without going through the storage layer.

To continue with this tutorial, you must purchase the [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) and enable Durable Objects by logging into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) > **Workers & Pages** > select your Worker > **Durable Objects**.

## Clone the chat application repository

Open your terminal and clone the [workers-chat-demo](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo) repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo.git
```

## Authenticate Wrangler

After you have cloned the repository, authenticate Wrangler by running:

```sh
$ npx wrangler login
```

## Deploy your project

When you are ready to deploy your application, run:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy
```

Your application will be deployed to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain.

To deploy your application to a custom domain within the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your Worker > **Triggers** > **Add Custom Domain**.

To deploy your application to a custom domain using Wrangler, open your project's `wrangler.toml`.

To configure a route in your `wrangler.toml`, add the following to your environment:

```toml
routes = [
    { pattern = "example.com/about", zone_id = "<YOUR_ZONE_ID>" }
]
```

If you have specified your zone ID in the environment of your `wrangler.toml`, you will not need to write it again in object form.

To configure a subdomain in your `wrangler.toml`, add the following to your environment:

```toml
routes = [
	{ pattern = "subdomain.example.com", custom_domain = true }
]
```

To test your live application:

1. Open your `edge-chat-demo.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev` subdomain. Your subdomain can be found in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) > **Workers & Pages** > your Worker > **Triggers** >  **Routes** > select the `edge-chat-demo.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev` route.
2. Enter a name in the **your name** field.
3. Choose whether to enter a public room or create a private room.
4. Send the link to other participants. You will be able to view room participants on the right side of the screen.

## Uninstall your application

To uninstall your chat application, modify your `wrangler.toml` file to remove the `durable_objects` bindings and add a `deleted_classes` migration:

```toml
[durable_objects]
bindings = [
]

# Indicate that you want the ChatRoom and RateLimiter classes to be callable as Durable Objects.
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_classes = ["ChatRoom", "RateLimiter"]

[[migrations]]
tag = "v2"
deleted_classes = ["ChatRoom", "RateLimiter"]
```

Then run `npx wrangler deploy`.

To delete your Worker:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers & Pages**.
3. In **Overview**, select your Worker.
4. Select **Manage Service** > **Delete**. For complete instructions on set up and deletion, refer to the `README.md` in your cloned repository.

By completing this tutorial, you have deployed a real-time chat application with Durable Objects and Cloudflare Workers.
