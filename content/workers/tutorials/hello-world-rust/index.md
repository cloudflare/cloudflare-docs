# Hello World in Rust

{{<render file="_tutorials-wrangler-v1-warning.md">}}

In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate, build, preview, configure, and publish a Rust-generated WebAssembly serverless function that parses Markdown for Cloudflare Workers.

{{<render file="_tutorials-before-you-start.md">}}

## Init

Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers projects, [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy), supports various templates ‚Äî pre-built collections of code that make it easy to get started writing Workers. You will use the [rustwasm-worker template](https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template/) to start building your project.

In the command line, create your Workers project, cloning the [rustwasm-worker-template](https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template) URL and passing in a project name (for example, `rustwasm-markdown-parser`):

```sh
~ $ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template/ rustwasm-markdown-parser
```

This command creates a directory called `rustwasm-markdown-parser` which you can now `cd` into.

Wrangler templates are git repositories. If you want to create your own templates, or use one from the [Template Gallery](/workers/examples/), there is a variety of options to help you get started.

## Workers Playground

You can test how your Workers function will execute when it is deployed by using the [`dev` command](/workers/wrangler-legacy/commands/#dev):

```sh
rustwasm-markdown-parser $ wrangler dev
```

Using the `dev` command will establish a connection between `localhost` and an global network server that operates your Worker in development.

## Building

Begin building your project by pulling in a dependency from the `crates.io` ecosystem called `pulldown-cmark`.
Add the following content to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
## Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
pulldown-cmark = "0.4.0"
```

Use the code in the `string-to-string` example from the `pulldown-cmark` GitHub repository. Change your `src/lib.rs` to look like this:

```rust
---
filename: src/lib.rs
---
mod utils;

use cfg_if::cfg_if;
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use pulldown_cmark::{Parser, Options, html};

cfg_if! {
    // When the `wee_alloc` feature is enabled, use `wee_alloc` as the global
    // allocator.
    if #[cfg(feature = "wee_alloc")] {
        extern crate wee_alloc;
        #[global_allocator]
        static ALLOC: wee_alloc::WeeAlloc = wee_alloc::WeeAlloc::INIT;
    }
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn parse() -> String {
    let markdown_input: &str = "Hello world, this is a ~~complicated~~ *very simple* example.";
    println!("Parsing the following Markdown string:\n{}", markdown_input);

    // Set up options and parser. Strikethroughs are not part of the CommonMark standard
    // and we therefore must enable it explicitly.
    let mut options = Options::empty();
    options.insert(Options::ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH);
    let parser = Parser::new_ext(markdown_input, options);

    // Write to String buffer.
    let mut html_output: String = String::with_capacity(markdown_input.len() * 3 / 2);
    html::push_html(&mut html_output, parser);

    // Check that the output is what you expected.
    let expected_html: &str = "<p>Hello world, this is a <del>complicated</del> <em>very simple</em> example.</p>\n";
    assert_eq!(expected_html, &html_output);

    format!("\nHTML output:\n{}", &html_output)
}
```

Update your `worker/worker.js` to use the new code:

```js
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

const { parse } = wasm_bindgen;
const instance = wasm_bindgen(wasm);

/**
 * Fetch and log a request
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  await instance;
  const output = parse();
  let res = new Response(output, { status: 200 });
  res.headers.set("Content-type", "text/html");
  return res;
}
```

If `wrangler dev` is running, you will see the output of your Rust program in your browser a few seconds after you save it in your editor. Wrangler watches your project for changes then compiles your Rust to WebAssembly and outputs compiler errors.

## Publish

You have completed writing a Cloudflare Workers function with Rust-generated Wasm.

Wrangler has built-in support for bundling, uploading, and releasing your Cloudflare Workers application. To do this, run `wrangler publish`, which will build and publish your code:
