# TransformStream

## Background

A transform stream consists of a pair of streams: a writable stream, known as its writable side, and a readable stream, known as its readable side. Writes to the writable side result in new data being made available for reading from the readable side.

A `TransformStream` can be acquired from:

* Constructing a `new TransformStream(...)` directly.
* Constructing a `new IdentityTransformStream(...)` directly.
* Constructing a `new FixedLengthStream(...)` directly.

Developers should refer to [MDNâ€™s `TransformStream` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream) for general details on using the `TransformStream` API.

```js
// Creating a TransformStream from scratch...
const { readable, writable } = new TransformStream({
  transform(chunk, controller) {
    controller.enqueue(chunk);
  }
});

// ...

// Creating an IdentityTransformStream from scratch...
const { readable, writable } = new IdentityTransformStream();

// ...

// Creating a FixedLengthStream from scratch...
const { readable, writable } = new FixedLengthStream(1000);
```

## `IdentityTransformStream`

The `IdentityTransformStream` forwards all chunks of byte data (in the form of `TypedArray`s) written to its writable side to its readable side, without any changes.

The `IdentityTransformStream` readable side supports [bring your own buffer (BYOB) reads](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamBYOBReader).

### Constructor

```js
let { readable, writable } = new IdentityTransformStream();
```

{{<definitions>}}

- `IdentityTransformStream()` {{<type>}}IdentityTransformStream{{</type>}}

  - Returns a new identity transform stream.

{{</definitions>}}

### Properties

{{<definitions>}}

- `readable` {{<type-link href="/workers/runtime-apis/streams/readablestream/">}}ReadableStream{{</type-link>}}
  - An instance of a `ReadableStream`.
- `writable` {{<type-link href="/workers/runtime-apis/streams/writablestream/">}}WritableStream{{</type-link>}}
  - An instance of a `WritableStream`.

{{</definitions>}}

## `FixedLengthStream`

The `FixedLengthStream` is a specialization of `IdentityTransformStream` that limits the total number of bytes that the stream will passthrough. It is useful primarily because, when using `FixedLengthStream` to produce either a `Response` or `Request`, the fixed length of the stream will be used as the `Content-Length` header value as opposed to use chunked encoding when using any other type of stream. An error will occur if too many, or too few bytes are written through the stream.

### Constructor

```js
let { readable, writable } = new FixedLengthStream(1000);
```

{{<definitions>}}

- `FixedLengthStream(length)` {{<type>}}FixedLengthStream{{</type>}}

  - Returns a new identity transform stream.
  - `length` maybe a `number` or `bigint` with a maximum value of `2^53 - 1`.

{{</definitions>}}

### Properties

{{<definitions>}}

- `readable` {{<type-link href="/workers/runtime-apis/streams/readablestream/">}}ReadableStream{{</type-link>}}
  - An instance of a `ReadableStream`.
- `writable` {{<type-link href="/workers/runtime-apis/streams/writablestream/">}}WritableStream{{</type-link>}}
  - An instance of a `WritableStream`.

{{</definitions>}}
