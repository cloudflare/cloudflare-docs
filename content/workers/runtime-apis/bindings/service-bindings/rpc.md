# Service Bindings — RPC

[Service bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings) allow one Worker to call into another, without going through a publicly-accessible URL.

You can use Service bindings to create your own internal APIs that your Worker makes available to other Workers. This can be done by extending the built-in `WorkerEntrypoint` class, and adding your own public methods. These public methods can then be directly called by other Workers on your Cloudflare account that declare a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) to this Worker.

The [RPC system in Workers](/workers/runtime-apis/rpc) is designed feel as similar as possible to calling a JavaScript function in the same Worker. In most cases, you should be able to write code in the same way you would if everything was in a single Worker.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
You can also use RPC to communicate between Workers and [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/best-practices/create-durable-object-stubs-and-send-requests/#call-rpc-methods).
{{</Aside>}}

## Example

For example, the following Worker implements the public method `add(a, b)`:

{{<render file="_service-binding-rpc-example.md" productFolder="workers">}}

You do not need to learn, implement, or think about special protocols to use the RPC system. The client, in this case Worker A, calls Worker B and tells it to execute a specific procedure using specific arguments that the client provides. This is accomplished with standard JavaScript classes.

## The `WorkerEntrypoint` Class

To provide RPC methods from your Worker, you must extend the `WorkerEntrypoint` class, as shown in the example below:

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async add(a, b) { return a + b; }
}
```

A new instance of the class is created every time the Worker is called. Note that even though the Worker is implemented as a class, it is still stateless — the class instance only lasts for the duration of the invocation. If you need to persist or coordinate state in Workers, you should use [Durable Objects](/durable-objects).

### Bindings (`env`)

The [`env`](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) object is exposed as a class property of the `WorkerEntrypoint` class.

For example, a Worker that declares a binding to the [environment variable](/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) `GREETING`:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "my-worker"

[vars]
GREETING = "Hello"
```

Can access it by calling `this.env.GREETING`:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  fetch() { return new Response("Hello from my-worker"); }

  async greet(name) {
    return this.env.GREETING + name;
  }
}
```

You can use any type of [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) this way.

### Lifecycle methods (`ctx`)

The [`ctx`](/workers/runtime-apis/context) object is exposed as a class property of the `WorkerEntrypoint` class.

For example, you can extend the lifetime of the invocation context by calling the `waitUntil()` method:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  fetch() { return new Response("Hello from my-worker"); }

  async signup(email, name) {
    // sendEvent() will continue running, even after this method returns a value to the caller
    this.ctx.waitUntil(this.#sendEvent("signup", email))
    // Perform any other work
    return "Success";
  }

  async #sendEvent(eventName, email) {
    //...
  }
}
```

## Named entrypoints

You can also export any number of named `WorkerEntrypoint` classes from within a single Worker, in addition to the default export. You can then declare a Service binding to a specific named entrypoint.

You can use this to group multiple pieces of compute together. For example, you might create a distinct `WorkerEntrypoint` for each permission role in your application, and use these to provide role-specific RPC methods:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "todo-app"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "D1"
database_name = "todo-app-db"
database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
```

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class AdminEntrypoint extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async createUser(username) {
    await this.env.D1.prepare("INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES (?)")
      .bind(username)
      .run();
  }

  async deleteUser(username) {
    await this.env.D1.prepare("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = ?")
      .bind(username)
      .run();
  }
}

export class UserEntrypoint extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async getTasks(userId) {
    return await this.env.D1.prepare(
      "SELECT title FROM tasks WHERE user_id = ?"
    )
      .bind(userId)
      .all();
  }

  async createTask(userId, title) {
    await this.env.D1.prepare(
      "INSERT INTO tasks (user_id, title) VALUES (?, ?)"
    )
      .bind(userId, title)
      .run();
  }
}

export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    return new Response("Hello from my to do app");
  }
}
```

You can then declare a Service binding directly to `AdminEntrypoint` in another Worker:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "admin-app"

[[services]]
binding = "ADMIN"
service = "todo-app"
entrypoint = "AdminEntrypoint"
```

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    await env.ADMIN.createUser("aNewUser");
    return new Response("Hello from admin app");
  },
};
```

You can learn more about how to configure D1 in the [D1 documentation](/d1/get-started/#3-bind-your-worker-to-your-d1-database).

You can try out a complete example of this to do app, as well as a Discord bot built with named entrypoints, by cloning the [cloudflare/js-rpc-and-entrypoints-demo repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/js-rpc-and-entrypoints-demo) from GitHub.
