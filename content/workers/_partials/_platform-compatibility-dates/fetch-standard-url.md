The `fetch_standard_url` flag makes `fetch()` use [WHATWG URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) parsing rules. The original implementation would throw `TypeError: Fetch API cannot load` errors with some URLs where standard parsing does not, for instance with the inclusion of whitespace before the URL.
