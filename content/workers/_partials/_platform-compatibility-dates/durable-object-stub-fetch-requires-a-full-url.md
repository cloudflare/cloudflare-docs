Originally, when making a request to a Durable Object by calling `stub.fetch(url)`, a relative URL was accepted as an input. The URL would be interpreted relative to the dummy URL `http://fake-host`, and the resulting absolute URL was delivered to the destination object's `fetch()` handler. This was a mistake â€” full URLs were meant to be required. This flag makes full URLs required.
