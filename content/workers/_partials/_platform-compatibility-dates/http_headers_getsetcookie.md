The WHATWG introduced the new `getSetCookie()` method on the `Headers` class. Because the method is
new and changes the behavior of the `Headers` class key/value iterators there is a risk of breaking
existing code. To mitigate this risk, the new behavior will be opt-in via a compatibility flag
that became the default on March 1, 2023.

Without this flag, the iterator on the `Headers` object will improperly combine the values of
`Set-Cookie` headers into a single item. With the flag enabled, the iterator appropriately keeps
`Set-Cookie` headers separate while continuing to combine other headers.
