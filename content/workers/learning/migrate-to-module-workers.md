# Migrate to ES modules format

This guide will show you how to migrate your Workers from the [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) format to the [ES modules](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-javascript-modules/) format.

## Advantages of migrating

There are several reasons to migrate your Workers to the ES modules format:

1.  Many products within Cloudflare's Developer Platform, such as [Durable Objects](/workers/learning/using-durable-objects/), and other features of Cloudflare Workers, require the ES modules format.
2.  Workers using ES modules format do not rely on any global bindings. This means the Workers runtime does not need to set up fresh execution contexts, making Workers safer and faster to run.
3.  Workers using ES modules format can be shared and published to `npm`. Workers using ES modules format can be imported by and composed within other Workers that use ES modules format.

## Migrate a simple Worker

The following example demonstrates a Worker that redirects all incoming requests to a URL with a `301` status code.

With the Service Worker syntax, the example Worker looks like:

```js
async function handler(request) {
  const base = 'https://example.com';
  const statusCode = 301;

  const destination = new URL(request.url, base);
  return Response.redirect(destination.toString(), statusCode);
}

// Initialize Worker
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handler(event.request));
});
```

Workers using ES modules format replace the `addEventListener` syntax with an object definition, which must be the file's default export (via `export default`). The example code above becomes:

```js
export default {
  fetch(request) {
    const base = 'https://example.com';
    const statusCode = 301;

    const destination = new URL(request.url, base);
    return Response.redirect(destination.toString(), statusCode);
  },
};
```

## Bindings

[Bindings](/workers/platform/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Cloudflare developer platform.

Workers using ES modules format do not rely on any global bindings. However, Service Worker syntax accesses bindings on the global scope.

To understand bindings, refer the following `TODO` KV namespace binding example. To create a `TODO` KV namespace binding, you will:

1. Create a KV namespace named `My Tasks` and receive an ID that you will use in your binding.
2. Create a Worker.
3. Find your Worker's `wrangler.toml` configuration file and add a KV namespace binding:

```toml
kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "TODO", id = "<ID>" }
]
```

In the following sections, you will use your binding in Service Worker and ES modules format.

To learn more about how to reference KV from Workers, refer to the [KV bindings documentation](/workers/runtime-apis/kv/#kv-bindings).

### Bindings in Service Worker format

In Service Worker syntax, your `TODO` KV namespace binding is defined in the global scope of your Worker. Your `TODO` KV namespace binding is available to use anywhere in your Worker application's code.

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
addEventListener("fetch", async (event) => {
  return await getTodos()
});

async function getTodos() {
  // Get the value for the "to-do:123" key
  // NOTE: Relies on the TODO KV binding that maps to the "My Tasks" namespace.
  let value = await TODO.get("to-do:123");

  // Return the value, as is, for the Response
  event.respondWith(new Response(value));
}
```

### Bindings in ES modules format

In ES modules format, bindings are only available inside the `env` parameter that is provided at the entrypoint to your Worker.

To access the `TODO` KV namespace binding in your Worker code, the `env` parameter must be passed from the `fetch` handler in your Worker to the `getTodos` function.

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
import { getTodos } from './todos'

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Passing the env parameter so other functions
    // can reference the bindings available in the Workers application
    return await getTodos(env)
  },
};
```

The following code represents a `getTodos` function that calls the `get` function on the `TODO` KV binding.

```js
---
filename: todos.js
---
async function getTodos(env) {
  // NOTE: Relies on the TODO KV binding which has been provided inside of 
  // the env parameter of the `getTodos` function
  let value = await env.TODO.get("to-do:123");
  return new Response(value);
}

export { getTodos }
```

## Access `event` or `context` data

Workers often need access to data not in the `request` object. For example, sometimes Workers use [`waitUntil`](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/#waituntil) to delay execution. Workers using ES modules format can access `waitUntil` via the `context` parameter. Refer to [ES modules parameters](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/#parameters) for  more information.

This example code:

```js
async function triggerEvent(event) {
  // Fetch some data
  console.log('cron processed', event.scheduledTime);
}

// Initialize Worker
addEventListener('scheduled', event => {
  event.waitUntil(triggerEvent(event));
});
```

Then becomes:

```js
async function triggerEvent(event) {
  // Fetch some data
  console.log('cron processed', event.scheduledTime);
}

export default {
  async scheduled(event, env, ctx) {
    ctx.waitUntil(triggerEvent(event));
  },
};

export default worker;
```

## Service Worker syntax

A Worker written in Service Worker syntax consists of two parts:

1.  An [event listener](/workers/runtime-apis/add-event-listener/) that listens for [`FetchEvents`](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/), and
2.  An event handler that returns a [Response](/workers/runtime-apis/response/) object which is passed to the event’s `.respondWith()` method.

When a request is received on one of Cloudflare’s global network servers for a URL matching a Workers script, it passes the request to the Workers runtime. This dispatches a [`FetchEvent`](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/) in the [isolate](/workers/learning/how-workers-works/#isolates) where the script is running.

```js
---
filename: ~/my-worker/index.js
---
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response('Hello worker!', {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  });
}
```

Below is an example of the request response workflow:

1.  An event listener for the `FetchEvent` tells the script to listen for any request coming to your Worker. The event handler is passed the `event` object, which includes `event.request`, a [`Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) object which is a representation of the HTTP request that triggered the `FetchEvent`.

2.  The call to [`.respondWith()`](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/#respondwith) lets the Workers runtime intercept the request in order to send back a custom response (in this example, the plain text “Hello worker!”).

    - The `FetchEvent` handler typically culminates in a call to the method `.respondWith()` with either a [`Response`](/workers/runtime-apis/response/) or `Promise<Response>` that determines the response.

    - The `FetchEvent` object also provides [two other methods](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/#lifecycle-methods) to handle unexpected exceptions and operations that may complete after a response is returned.
