# Debugging Workers

Debugging is a critical part of developing a new application â€” whether running code in the initial stages of development, or trying to understand an issue occurring in production. In this article, you will learn how to effectively debug your Workers application, as well as review some code samples to help you get started:

## Local testing with `wrangler dev`

When you are developing your Workers application, the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command can significantly reduce the time it takes to test and debug new features. It can help you get feedback quickly while iterating, by easily exposing logs on `localhost`, and allows you to experiment without deploying to production.

This command will run the preview of the Worker directly on your local machine using the open source Cloudflare Workers runtime, [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) and the [Miniflare](https://miniflare.dev/) simulator.

In addition to testing Workers locally, the use of Miniflare allows you to test other Developer Platform products such as: R2, KV, D1, and Durable Objects. For more information on how to test these, refer to the [Miniflare docs](https://miniflare.dev/).

### Local testing against remote resources

While `wrangler dev` runs locally by default, you can run `wrangler dev --remote` to deploy your application to the edge preview service, and make it available for access on `localhost`:

```sh
$ wrangler dev

  Built successfully, built project size is 27 KiB.
  Using namespace for Workers Site "__app-workers_sites_assets_preview"
  Uploading site files
  Listening on http://localhost:8787

[2020-05-28 10:42:33] GET example.com/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[2020-05-28 10:42:35] GET example.com/static/nav-7cb303.png HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[2020-05-28 10:42:36] GET example.com/sw.js HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

In the output above, you can begin to see log lines for the URLs being requested locally.

Unlike `wrangler dev`, which provides local instances of resources to develop against, `wrangler dev --remote` will leverage remote resources specified in your `wrangler.toml`.

### Additional info

You can customize how `wrangler dev` works to fit your needs. Refer to [the `wrangler dev` documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) for available configuration options.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

There is a bug associated with `wrangler dev` documented in the [Known issues section](/workers/platform/known-issues/#wrangler-dev).

## Getting logs from deployed Workers

If you need more insight into currently deployed Workers, you can start a new session to livestream logs by running `wrangler tail`.
