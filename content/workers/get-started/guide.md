# Get started guide

This guide will instruct you through setting up a Cloudflare account to deploying your first Worker. This guide assumes that you already have a Cloudflare account. If you do not have a Cloudflare account, [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers) before continuing.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Try the Playground">}}

The quickest way to experiment with Cloudflare Workers is in the [Playground](https://cloudflareworkers.com/#36ebe026bf3510a2e5acace89c09829f:about:blank). The Playground does not require any setup. It is a simple, instant way to preview and test a Workers script directly in the browser against any site.

{{</Aside>}}

## 1. Start a new project with Wrangler (the Workers CLI)

The Workers command-line interface, Wrangler, allows you to [create](/workers/wrangler/commands/#init), [test](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev), and [deploy](/workers/wrangler/commands/#publish) your Workers projects.

To use [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler), ensure you have [`npm` installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started), preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Using a version manager helps avoid permission issues and allows you to easily change Node.js versions.

To create a new Workers project (named `my-project`), run:

```sh
$ npx wrangler init my-project
```

In your terminal, you will be asked a series of questions related to your project.

{{<Aside type="note" header="TypeScript">}}

`wrangler init` will prompt you to choose y/n to `Would you like to use TypeScript? (y/n)`. If you indicate yes, you will get an `index.ts` file instead of a `index.js` file and Wrangler will also generate a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project. 

{{</Aside>}}

You can also use one of [Cloudflare's templates](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/templates#usage) to start a new project.

To start developing your Worker, `cd` into your new project directory:

```sh
$ cd my-project
``` 

In your project directory, `wrangler init` has generated the following files:

1. `wrangler.toml`: Your [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#sample-wranglertoml-configuration) configuration file.
2. `index.js` (in `/src`): A minimal Hello World Worker written in JavaScript module syntax.
3. `package.json`: A minimal Node dependencies configuration file. Only generated if indicated in `wrangler init` command.
4. `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration that includes [Workers types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types). Only generated if indicated in `wrangler init` command.

---

## 2. Run your development server

After you have created your first Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to test your Worker in development. 

```sh
$ npx wrangler dev
```

If you have not used Wrangler before, it will try to open your web browser to login with your Cloudflare account.
{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you have issues with this step or you do not have access to a browser interface, refer to the [`wrangler login`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#login) documentation for more information.
{{</Aside>}}

You will now be able to go to [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) to see your Worker running. Any changes you make to your code will trigger a rebuild, and reloading the page will show you the up-to-date output of your Worker.

## 3. Write code

With your new project generated, you can begin to write your code.

After running the `wrangler init` command to generate your Worker, the `index.js` (or `index.ts` if you chose to generate a TypeScript project) file will be populated with the code below:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Hello World!");
  },
};
```

This code block consists of four parts:

1. The `export` statement: `export default`

`export default` is JavaScript syntax required for defining [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#default_exports_versus_named_exports). Your Worker has to have a default export of an object, with properties corresponding to the events your Worker should handle.

2. The event handler: `async fetch(request)`

This event handler will be called when your Worker receives a [`fetch` event](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/). You can define additional event handlers in the exported object to respond to different types of events. For example, add an `async scheduled(event) {}` function definition to respond to [`scheduled` events](/workers/runtime-apis/scheduled-event/). 

3. Parameters: `request`, `env`, `context`

The `fetch` event handler will always get three parameters passed into it: [`request`, `env` and `context`](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/#syntax-module-worker).

4. The `Response` object: `return new Response("Hello World!");`

The Workers runtime expects `fetch` events to return a `Response` object. In this example, you will return a new Response with the string `"Hello World!"`.

To review code changes in real time, rewrite the `"Hello World!"` string to `"Hello Worker!"` and, with `wrangler dev` running, save your changes.

To experiment with more premade Workers, refer to [Workers Examples](/workers/examples/).

## 4. Publish your project

With your project configured, you can now publish your Worker, to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain, or a [custom domain](/workers/platform/triggers/custom-domains/), if you have one configured. If you have not configured any subdomain or domain, Wrangler will prompt you during the publish process to set one up.

```sh
---
header: Publish to workers.dev
---
$ npx wrangler publish
```

Preview your Worker at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}

When pushing to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain for the first time, you may see [`523` errors](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115003011431#523error) while DNS is propagating. These errors should resolve themselves after a minute or so.

{{</Aside>}}

## 5. Write tests

We recommend writing tests against your Worker. One way to do this is with the [`unstable_dev`](/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_dev) API in Wrangler. `unstable_dev` is used for writing integration and end-to-end tests.

After running the `wrangler init` command, you will be prompted with questions asking `would you like us to write your first test?`, and `which test runner you will like to use?`. If you indicate yes and select either `vitest` or `jest` as your test runner, an `index.test.js` file will be created with the following block of code included in the file: 

```js
const { unstable_dev } = require("wrangler");

describe("Worker", () => {
	let worker;

	beforeAll(async () => {
		worker = await unstable_dev("src/index.js", {
			experimental: { disableExperimentalWarning: true },
		});
	});

	afterAll(async () => {
		await worker.stop();
	});

	it("should return Hello World", async () => {
		const resp = await worker.fetch();
		if (resp) {
			const text = await resp.text();
			expect(text).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`"Hello World!"`);
		}
	});
});
```

The code block consists of 4 parts:

1. The import statement `const { unstable_dev } = require("wrangler");`, this initializes the `unstable_dev` API so it can be used in the test suite. The `unstable_dev` function accepts two parameters - `await unstable_dev(script, options)`.

2. The `beforeAll()` function for initializing `unstable_dev()`, this helps minimize the overhead required to start the dev server for each individual test, running the dev server for each test will take a longer time to resolve which can end up slowing down the tests.

3. The `afterAll()` function, which calls `await worker.stop()` for stopping the dev server after it runs the test suite.

4. The `await worker.fetch()` function, for checking the response received corresponds with what you were expecting.
