# Cloudflare Workers documentation

Cloudflare Workers provides a [serverless](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/) execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

Cloudflare Workers runs on Cloudflare’s global [cloud network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/) in over 200 cities around the world, offering both [free and paid plans](/workers/platform/pricing/).

## Installing the Workers CLI

To install [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2), ensure you have [`npm` installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started), preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Using a version manager helps avoid permission issues and allows you to easily change Node.js versions. Then run:

```sh
$ npm install -g wrangler
```

or install with `yarn`:

```sh
$ yarn global add wrangler
```

Read more about [installing Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
