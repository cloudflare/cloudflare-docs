# Bindings

Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Cloudflare Developer Platform.

There are multiple types of bindings available today.

To learn how to access bindings in your code, refer to [Bindings](/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/#bindings) in the Migrate to ES Modules guide.

## Configuration

Bindings can be configured in one of two ways:

* Updating your project's [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bindings).
* Logging in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) > Account Home > **Workers & Pages** > your Worker > **Settings**> **Variables**.

### Service bindings

Service bindings allow for communication with another Worker.

* Learn more about [Service bindings](/workers/configuration/bindings/about-service-bindings/).
* Configure Service bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#service-bindings).

### KV namespace bindings

KV namespace bindings allow for communication between a Worker and a KV namespace.

* Learn more about [KV namespace bindings](/kv/reference/kv-bindings/).
* Configure KV namespace bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#kv-namespaces).

### Durable Object bindings

Durable Object bindings for communication between a Worker and a Durable Object.

* Learn more about [Durable Object bindings](/durable-objects/how-to/access-durable-object-from-a-worker/).
* Configure Durable Object bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#durable-objects).

### R2 bucket bindings

R2 bucket bindings for communication between a Worker and an R2 bucket.

* Learn more about [R2 bucket bindings](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/#create-a-binding).
* Configure R2 bucket bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#r2-buckets).

### Queue bindings

[Queue](/queues/) bindings allow for communication between a Worker and a Queue.

- Configure Queue bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/queues/reference/configuration/).

### D1 database bindings

[D1](/d1/) bindings allow you to query a D1 database from your Worker.

- Create your first [D1 binding](/d1/get-started/#4-bind-your-worker-to-your-d1-database).
- Configure a D1 bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#d1-databases).
- Learn more about how to query a D1 database using the [client API](/d1/how-to/query-databases/).

### Vectorize database bindings

[Vectorize](/vectorize/) bindings allow you to interact with and query a Vectorize index from your Worker.

- Create your first [Vectorize binding](/vectorize/get-started/).
- Configure a Vectorize binding via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#vectorize-indexes).
- Learn more about how to query a Vectorize index using the [client API](/vectorize/reference/client-api/).

### Dispatch namespace bindings (Workers for Platforms)

Dispatch namespace bindings allow for communication between a dynamic dispatch Worker and a dispatch namespace. Dispatch namespace bindings are used in [Workers for Platforms](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/). Workers for Platforms helps you deploy serverless functions programmatically on behalf of your customers.

- Create your first [dispatch namespace binding](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/configuration/#3-create-a-dynamic-dispatch-worker).

### mTLS certificate bindings

mTLS certificate bindings enable Worker subrequests to present a client certificate when communicating with a service that requires client authentication.

- Learn more about [mTLS certificate bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/mtls/).
- Configure mTLS certificate bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#mtls-certificates).

### Email bindings

Email bindings allow you to send emails from your Worker. This is useful for when you want to know about certain types of events being triggered, for example.

- Learn more about [email bindings](/email-routing/email-workers/send-email-workers/).
- Configure email bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#email-bindings).

### Workers AI bindings

[Workers AI](/workers-ai/) bindings allow for communication between a Worker and an AI/ML model.

- Learn more about [Workers AI bindings](/workers-ai/).
- Create your first [AI binding](/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/#2-connect-your-worker-to-workers-ai).
- Configure Workers AI bindings via your [`wrangler.toml` file](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#ai).
