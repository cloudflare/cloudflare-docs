{{<heading-pill style="beta">}}Rollbacks{{</heading-pill>}}

You can rollback to a previously deployed [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker using [wrangler](/workers/wrangler/commands/#rollback) or the dashboard. Rollback will immediately create a new [deployment](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#deployments) with the version specified and become the active deployment across all your deployed routes and domains. 

Perform a rollback via [Wrangler](/workers/configuration/deployments/#via-wrangler-1) or the [Cloudflare dashboard](/workers/configuration/deployments/#via-the-cloudflare-dashboard-1).

## Via Wrangler

To roll back via Wrangler, use the `wrangler rollback` command. Refer to [Wrangler `rollback` command documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#rollback) for more information.

## Via the Cloudflare Dashboard

To perform a rollback via the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) and select your account.
2. In **Overview**, select your Worker > **Deployments**. 
3. Select the three dot icon on the right of the version you would like to rollback to and select **Rollback**.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

**[Resources connected to your Worker](/workers/configuration/bindings/) will not be changed during a rollback.**

Errors could occur if using code for a prior version if the structure of data has changed between the version in the active deployment and the version selected to rollback to.

{{</Aside>}}
## Limits

1. You can only rollback to the 10 most recently published versions. 

2. You cannot perform a rollback if Cloudflare Developer Platform resources (eg. bound services, KV, D1) have been deleted or modified between the version selected to rollback to and the version in the active deployment. Specifically, rollbacks will not be allowed if:

- A [Durable Object migration](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) has occurred between the version in the active deployment and the version selected to rollback to.
- If the target deployment has a binding to an R2 bucket, KV namespace, or queue that no longer exists.
