# Local development and testing

Cloudflare Workers can be fully developed and tested locally - providing confidence that the applications you develop locally work the same way in production. This allows you to be more efficient and effective by providing a faster feedback loop and removing the need to test against remote resources. Local development runs against the same production runtime used by Cloudflare Workers, [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd).

In addition to testing Workers locally with `wrangler dev`, the use of Miniflare allows you to test other Developer Platform products locally, such as [R2](/r2/), [KV](/kv/), [D1](/d1/), and [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/).


## Start a local development server

{{<Aside type="note">}}

This guide assumes you are using [Wrangler v3.0](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wrangler3/) or later.

Users new to Wrangler CLI and Cloudflare Workers should visit the [Wrangler Install/Update guide](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update) to install `wrangler`.

{{</Aside>}}

Wrangler provides a [`dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command that starts a local server for developing your Worker. Make sure you have `npm` installed and run the following in the folder containing your Worker application:

```sh
$ npx wrangler dev
```

`wrangler dev` will run the preview of the Worker directly on your local machine. `wrangler dev` uses a combination of `workerd` and [Miniflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare), a simulator that allows you to test your Worker against additional resources like KV, Durable Objects, WebSockets, and more. Resources such as KV, Durable Objects, D1, and R2 will be stored and persisted locally and not affect live production or preview data.

### Clear Wrangler's local storage

Wrangler will store all locally created resources and storage in a `.wrangler` folder inside your Worker directory. This folder should be added to your `.gitignore` file.

If you need to clear local storage, delete the `.wrangler/state` folder. It will be recreated the next time you run `wrangler dev`.

### Develop locally using remote resources and bindings

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Developing against remote resources will count towards billable usage. `wrangler dev --remote` will leverage remote production resources specified in your `wrangler.toml`. These resources will use production data, and will count towards account usage for billing purposes.

{{</Aside>}}

`wrangler dev` runs locally by default. This means that all resources and bindings are simulated locally as well. However, there may be times you need to develop against remote resources and bindings. To run `wrangler dev` remotely, add the `--remote` flag:

```sh
$ npx wrangler dev --remote
```

Remote resources to use during `wrangler dev --remote` are specified with preview ID/names such as `preview_id` or `preview_bucket name`. Preview resources can be resources separate from production resources to prevent changing production data in development. `wrangler dev --remote` only supports preview ID/names for storage resources such as KV, R2, and D1. To change production data in `wrangler dev --remote`, set the preview ID/name of the resource to the ID/name of the production resource.

### Customize `wrangler dev`

You can customize how `wrangler dev` works to fit your needs. Refer to [the `wrangler dev` documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) for available configuration options.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

There is a bug associated with how outgoing requests are handled when using `wrangler dev --remote`. For more information, read the [Known issues section](/workers/platform/known-issues/#wrangler-dev).

{{</Aside>}}

## DevTools

Wrangler supports using the [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) to view logs/sources, set breakpoints, and profile CPU/memory usage. With `wrangler dev` running, press the <kbd>d</kbd> key in your terminal to open a DevTools session connected to your Worker from any Chromium-based browser.

## Debug via breakpoints

As of Wrangler 3.9.0, you can debug via breakpoints in your Worker. Breakpoints provide the ability to see exactly what is happening at a given point in the execution of your Worker. This functionality exists in both DevTools and VS Code.

For more information on breakpoint debugging via Chrome's DevTools, refer to [Chrome's article on breakpoints](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/).

### Setup VS Code to use breakpoints

To setup VS Code for breakpoint debugging Workers:

1. Create a `.vscode` folder in your project's root folder if one does not exist.
2. Within that folder, create a `launch.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
      {
          "name": "Wrangler",
          "type": "node",
          "request": "attach",
          "port": 9229,
          "cwd": "/",
          "resolveSourceMapLocations": null,
          "attachExistingChildren": false,
          "autoAttachChildProcesses": false,
          "sourceMaps": true // works with or without this line
      }
  ]
}
```

3. Open your project in VS Code, open a new terminal window from VS Code, and run `npx wrangler dev` to start the local dev server.

4. At the top of the **Run & Debug** panel, you should see an option to select a configuration. Choose **Wrangler**, and select the play icon. You should see **Wrangler: Remote Process [0]** show up in the Call Stack panel on the left.

5. Go back to a `.js` or `.ts` file in your project and add at least one breakpoint.

5. Open your browser and go to the Worker's local URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`). The breakpoint should be hit, and you should see details about your code at the specified line.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

Note that breakpoint debugging in `wrangler dev` using `--remote` could extend Worker CPU time and incur additional costs. It is recommended to use `wrangler dev` in local mode by specifying no `--remote` option or with `--local`.

{{</Aside>}}

{{<Aside type="note" header="Tip">}}

The `.vscode/launch.json` file only applies to a single project, if you prefer you can also add the above launch configuration to your user's settings (as per the [official VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_global-launch-configuration)) in order to have it available for all your projects.

## Test Workers

### Integration testing

Wrangler offers an experimental API, `unstable_dev`, that will allow you to start a server for integration testing.

For more information and examples, refer to the [`unstable_dev` guide](/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_dev).

### Advanced local testing via Miniflare

[Miniflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/blob/v3.20231016.0/packages/miniflare/README.md) is a simulator for developing and testing Workers. It supports simulating and mocking resources like: KV, Durable Objects, R2, D1, and Queues.

Miniflare is fully local, and is built on top of the Workers runtime, [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) to ensure that local behavior accurately reflects production. All of this makes it a great tool for writing tests or advanced use cases.
