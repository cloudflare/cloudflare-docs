# Available subscriptions

When [provisioning services for an account](/tenant/how-to/manage-subscriptions/), you need to include certain values with each API call to specify a particular service.

The subscriptions available to you will vary depending on your current partner program ([Self-Service Partner Program](https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-partners-self-serve-program-closed-beta/) or [Enterprise Resellers and MSP Program](portal.cloudflarepartners.com)).

The following values are samples and not exhaustive. For the complete list of subscription values available to you, make an API call to the [zone subscriptions](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-rate-plan-list-available-rate-plans) or [account subscriptions](https://api.cloudflare.com/#account-subscriptions-list-subscriptions) endpoints.

## Zone plans

When creating or updating a [zone plan](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-subscription-properties), Partners can use one of the following values for the `id` of the `rate_plan` field (which controls the zone-level plan subscription).

| Partner program | Available subscriptions |
| --- | --- |
| Enterprise and self-serve resellers | `PARTNERS_FREE`, `PARTNERS_PRO`, `PARTNERS_BIZ`, `PARTNERS_ENT` |
| PAYGO partners | `CF_FREE`, `CF_PRO_20_20`, `CF_BIZ`, `CF_ENT` |
| MSP partners | `msp_biz` |

## Other subscriptions

When you [create an account subscription](/tenant/how-to/manage-subscriptions/#account-subscriptions), it provisions an add-on service for that account.

## Getting new subscriptions

If your reseller plan does not have access to a specific subscription, you will receive the following error when making an API call.

```json
"errors": [
        {
            "code": 1225,
            "message": "Your account does not have access to this product. Contact billing@cloudflare.com for assistance."
        }
]
```

To change your program or - in some cases - get a specific subscription added to your reseller plan, contact `partners@cloudflare.com`.
