# Tenant structure

Cloudflare helps Channel and Alliance partners manage their and their customers' accounts through a Tenant structure.

![Partner accounts contain a tenant, which is a container for customer accounts and zones. For more details, keep reading.](/images/tenant/tenant-diagram.png)

## Tenants and Tenant admins

{{<render file="_tenant-definition.md">}}
\
{{<render file="_tenant-admin-definition.md">}}

## Accounts, users, and resources

This Tenant structure gives your account streamlined administrative access to customer:

- Accounts[^1]
- Users[^2]
- Resources[^3]

At the same time, this structure keeps your customers' data and settings separate from each other.

[^3]: {{<render file="_resource-definition.md">}}
