# Tenant structure

Cloudflare helps Channel and Alliance partners manage their and their customers' accounts through a Tenant structure.

![Partner accounts contain a tenant, which is a container for customer accounts and zones. For more details, keep reading.](/tenant/static/tenant-diagram.png)

## Tenants and Tenant admins

## Accounts, users, and resources

This Tenant structure gives your account streamlined administrative access to customer:

- Accounts[^1]
- Users[^2]
- Resources[^3]

At the same time, this structure keeps your customers' data and settings separate from each other.

## Limitations

Since non-Enterprise accounts can only have one Super administrator, your account will be the only Super administrator allowed on their account.

For more details, refer to [Super administrators](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/manage-account-members/#change-super-administrator).
