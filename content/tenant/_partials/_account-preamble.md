Each customer or team that uses Cloudflare should have their own account. This ensures proper security and access of resources. Each account acts as a container of zones and other resources. Depending on your needs, you may even provision multiple accounts for a single customer or team.

When you create an account with the Tenant API, your Cloudflare user owns that account from creation, ongoing management, and finally deletion.
