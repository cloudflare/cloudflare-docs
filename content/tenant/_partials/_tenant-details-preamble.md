A [**Tenant Admin**](/tenant/glossary/#tenant-admin)'s unit and membership details will be used for access of resources and all Tenant operations on the API. The unit ID (`unit_tag`), for example, can be used to create an account on a specific unit. 

This is especially useful when a Tenant Admin has multiple units and wants to create an account on a specific unit. All accounts created are associated with the units, each of which can have one or more memberships.
