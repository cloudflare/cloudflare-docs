# Requesting logs

## Endpoints

The three endpoints supported by the Logpull API are:

- `GET /logs/received` - returns HTTP request log data based on the parameters specified
- `GET /logs/received/fields` - returns the list of all available log fields
- `GET /logs/rayids/<rayid>` - returns HTTP request log data matching `<rayid>`

## Required authentication headers

The following headers are required for all endpoint calls:

- `X-Auth-Email` - the Cloudflare account email address associated with the domain
- `X-Auth-Key` - the Cloudflare API key

Alternatively, API tokens with Logs Edit permissions can also be used for authentication:

- `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>`

## Parameters

The API expects endpoint parameters in the GET request query string. The following are example formats:

`logs/received`

```bash
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/received?start=<unix|rfc3339>&end=<unix|rfc3339>[&count=<int>][&sample=<float>][&fields=<FIELDS>][&timestamps=<string>][&CVE-2021-44228=<boolean>]
```

`logs/rayids/<RAY_ID>`

```bash
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/rayids/<RAY_ID>?[&fields=<string>][&timestamps=<strings>]
```

The following table describes the parameters available:

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}

The maximum time range from **start** to **end** cannot exceed 1 hour. Because **start** is inclusive and **end** is exclusive, to get all the data for every minute, starting at 10AM, the proper values are:

`start=2018-05-15T10:00:00Z&end=2018-05-15T10:01:00Z`, then `start=2018-05-15T10:01:00Z&end=2018-05-15T10:02:00Z` and so on.

The overlap will be handled correctly.

## Example API requests using cURL

`logs/received`

```bash
curl -s \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
    "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/received?start=2017-07-18T22:00:00Z&end=2017-07-18T22:01:00Z&count=1&fields=ClientIP,ClientRequestHost,ClientRequestMethod,ClientRequestURI,EdgeEndTimestamp,EdgeResponseBytes,EdgeResponseStatus,EdgeStartTimestamp,RayID"
```

`logs/rayids/<RAY_ID>`

```bash
curl -s \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
    "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/rayids/47ff6e2c812d3ccb?timestamps=rfc3339"
```

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}

The IATA code returned as part of the **Ray ID** does not need to included in the request. For example, if you have a **RayID** such as `49ddb3e70e665831-DFW`, only include `49ddb3e70e665831` in your request.

## Fields

Unless specified in the **fields** parameter, the API returns a limited set of log fields. This default field set may change at any time. The list of all available fields is at:

`https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/received/fields`

The order in which fields are specified does not matter, and the order of fields in the response is not specified.

Using bash subshell and `jq`, you can download the logs with all available fields without manually copying and pasting the fields into the request. For example:

```bash
curl -s \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
    "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/received?start=2017-07-18T22:00:00Z&end=2017-07-18T22:01:00Z&count=1&fields=$(curl -s -H "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" -H "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/logs/received/fields" | jq '. | to_entries[] | .key' -r | paste -sd "," -)"
```

Refer to [HTTP request fields](/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/http_requests) for the currently available fields.
