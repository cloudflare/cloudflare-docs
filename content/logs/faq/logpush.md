# Logpush

{{<faq-item>}}
{{<faq-question level=2 text="What happens if my cloud storage destination is temporarily unavailable?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

**Logpush** is designed to retry in case of errors. If your destination is temporarily unavailable, Logpush will retry around five times over five minutes. However, note that this number and time are just approximations. If Cloudflare persistently receives errors from your destination, and cannot keep up with incoming batches, Logpush will eventually drop logs. If the errors continue for a prolonged period of time, Logpush will assume that the destination is permanently unavailable and disable your push job. You can always re-enable the job later.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="Can I adjust how often logs are pushed?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

No. Cloudflare pushes logs in batches as soon as possible.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="My job was accidentally turned off, and I did not receive my logs for a certain time period. Can they still be pushed to me?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

No. **Logpush** only pushes the logs once as they become available and is unable to backfill. However, the logs are stored for at least 72 hours and can be downloaded using the **Logpull API**.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="I have reconfigured the job to a new destination, but why am I still receiving the logs at the old destination?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

Although we cannot provide a precise time, we estimate that it will take 10-15 minutes to complete the transition. Refer to the question about [destination temporarily unavailable](/logs/faq/logpush/#what-happens-if-my-cloud-storage-destination-is-temporarily-unavailable), for more details on this topic.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="If I add new fields to an existing Logpush job, how long will it take for the change to become effective?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}} 

We cannot provide a precise time, but we estimate that the new fields will show up within 10-15 minutes.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="Why am I receiving a validating destination error while setting up a Splunk job?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}} 

You could be seeing this error for multiple reasons:
* The Splunk endpoint URL is not correct. Cloudflare only supports Splunk HEC raw endpoint over HTTPS.
* The Splunk authentication token is not correct. Be sure to URL-encode the token. For example, use `%20` for a space.
* The certificate for Splunk Server is not properly configured. Certificates generated by Splunk/third-party certificates should have the **Common Name** field in the certificate match the Splunk server’s domain name. Otherwise, you may see errors like: `x509: certificate is valid for SplunkServerDefaultCert, not <YOUR_INSTANCE>.splunkcloud.com.`

{{<faq-question level=2 text="What is the insecure-skip-verify parameter in Splunk jobs?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

This flag, if set to `true`, makes an insecure connection to Splunk. Setting this value to `true` is equivalent to using the `-k` option with `curl` as shown in Splunk examples and is **not** recommended. Cloudflare highly recommends setting this flag to `false` when using the `insecure-skip-verify` parameter.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="Why do we have the insecure-skip-verify parameter in Splunk jobs, if it is not recommended?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

Certificates generated by Splunk/third-party certificates should have the **Common Name** field in the certificate match the Splunk server’s domain name. Otherwise you may see errors like: `x509: certificate is valid for SplunkServerDefaultCert, not <YOUR_INSTANCE>.splunkcloud.com.` This happens especially with the default certificates generated by Splunk on startup. Pushes will never succeed unless the certificates are fixed.

The proper way to resolve the issue is to fix the certificates. This flag is only here for those rare scenarios when it is not possible to have access or permissions to fix the certificates, like with the Splunk cloud instances, which do not allow changing Splunk server configurations.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="How can I verify that my Splunk HEC is working correctly before setting up a job?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

Ensure that you can publish events to your Splunk instance through `curl` without the `-k` flag and with the **insecure-skip-verify** parameter set to `false`, as in the following example:

```bash
curl  "https://<SPLUNK_ENDPOINT_URL>?channel=<SPLUNK_CHANNEL_ID>&insecure-skip-verify=<INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY>&sourcetype=<SOURCE_TYPE>" \
   -H "Authorization: Splunk <SPLUNK_AUTH_TOKEN>" \
   -d '{"BotScore":99,"BotScoreSrc":"Machine Learning","CacheCacheStatus":"miss","CacheResponseBytes":2478}'
{"text":"Success","code":0}
```

{{<faq-question level=2 text="Can I use any HEC network port in the Splunk destination conf?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

No. Cloudflare expects the HEC network port to be configured to `:443` or `:8088`.

{{<faq-question level=2 text="Does Logpush integrate with the Cloudflare Splunk App?" >}}

{{<faq-answer>}}

Yes. Refer to [Cloudflare App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4501/) for more information. As long as you ingest logs using the `cloudflare:json` source type, you can use the Cloudflare Splunk App.
