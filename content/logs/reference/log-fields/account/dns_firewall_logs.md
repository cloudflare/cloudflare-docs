# DNS Firewall Logs

The descriptions below detail the fields available for `dns_firewall_logs`.

## ClientResponseCode

Type: int

Integer value of the response code Cloudflare presents to the client. Response code follows [IANA parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-6).

## ClusterID

Type: string

The ID of the cluster which handled this request.

## ColoCode

Type: string

IATA airport code of data center that received the request.

## EDNSSubnet

Type: string

IPv4 or IPv6 address information corresponding to the [EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)](/glossary/?term=ecs) forwarded by recursive resolvers. Not all resolvers send this information.

## EDNSSubnetLength

Type: int

Size of the [EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)](/glossary/?term=ecs) in bits. For example, if the last octet of an IPv4 address is omitted (`192.0.2.x.`), the subnet length will be 24.

## QueryDO

Type: bool

Indicates if the client is capable of handling a signed response (DNSSEC answer OK).

## QueryName

Type: string

Name of the query that was sent.

## QueryRD

Type: bool

Indicates if the client means a recursive query (Recursion Desired).

## QuerySize

Type: int

The size of the query sent from the client in bytes.

## QueryTCP

Type: bool

Indicates if the query from the client was made via TCP (if false, then UDP).

## QueryType

Type: int

Integer value of query type. For more information refer to [Query type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-4).

## ResponseCached

Type: bool

Whether the response was cached or not.

## ResponseCachedStale

Type: bool

Whether the response was cached stale. In other words, the TTL had expired and the upstream nameserver was not reachable.

## ResponseReason

## SourceIP

IP address of the client (IPv4 or IPv6).

## Timestamp

Type: int or string

Timestamp at which the query occurred.

## UpstreamIP

Type: string

IP of the upstream nameserver (IPv4 or IPv6).

## UpstreamResponseCode

Type: int

Integer value of the response code from the upstream nameserver. Response code follows [IANA parameters](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-6)

## UpstreamResponseTimeMs

Type: int

Upstream response time in milliseconds.
