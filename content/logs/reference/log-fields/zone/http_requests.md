| SecuritySources | Array of security products that matched the request. The same product can appear multiple times, which indicates different rules or actions that were activated. The rule IDs can be found in SecurityRuleIDs, and the actions can be found in SecurityActions.

| WorkerSubrequestCount | Number of subrequests issued by a worker when handling this request. | int |
| WorkerWallTimeUs | The elapsed time in microseconds between the start of a Worker invocation, and when the Workers Runtime determines that no more JavaScript needs to run. Specifically, this measures the wall-clock time that the JavaScript context remained open. For example, when returning a response with a large body, the Workers runtime can, in some cases, determine that no more JavaScript needs to run, and closes the JS context before all the bytes have passed through and been sent. Alternatively, if you use the `waitUntil()` API to perform work without blocking the return of a response, this work may continue executing after the response has been returned, and will be included in `WorkerWallTimeUs`. | int |
| ZoneName | The human-readable name of the zone (e.g. 'cloudflare.com'). | string |
