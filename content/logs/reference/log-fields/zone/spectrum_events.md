| Application | The unique public ID of the application on which the event occurred | string |
| ClientAsn | Client AS number | int |
| ClientBytes | The number of bytes read from the client by the Spectrum service | int |
| ClientCountry | Country of the client IP address | string |
| ClientIP | Client IP address | string |
| ClientMatchedIpFirewall | Whether the connection matched any IP Firewall rules. UNKNOWN = No match or Firewall not enabled for spectrum; <em>UNKNOWN</em> \| <em>ALLOW</em> \| <em>BLOCK_ERROR</em> \| <em>BLOCK_IP</em> \| <em>BLOCK_COUNTRY</em> \| <em>BLOCK_ASN</em> \| <em>WHITELIST_IP</em> \| <em>WHITELIST_COUNTRY</em> \| <em>WHITELIST_ASN</em> | string |

| OriginProto | Transport protocol used by origin; <em>tcp</em> \| <em>udp</em> \| <em>unix</em> | string |
| OriginTcpRtt | The TCP round-trip time in nanoseconds between Spectrum and the origin | int |
| OriginTlsCipher | The cipher negotiated between Spectrum and the origin. In v1, an unknown cipher returned as "Unknown." In v2, it's returned as "UNK." | string |
