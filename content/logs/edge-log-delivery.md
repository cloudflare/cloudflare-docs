# Edge Log Delivery

Edge Log Delivery allows customers to send logs directly from Cloudflareâ€™s edge to their destination of choice. Logs may be delivered in as little as 10 seconds. Compared to Logpush, Edge Log Delivery sends logs with lower latency, more frequently and in smaller batches.

Edge Log Delivery is only available for HTTP request logs. Refer to the [API configuration](/logs/get-started/api-configuration/#kind) page for steps on how to configure a job to use Edge Log Delivery.
