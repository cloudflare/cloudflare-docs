# Permissions

Below is a description of the available permissions for tokens and roles as they relate to Logs. For information about how to create an API token, refer to [Creating API tokens](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/).

## Tokens

*   **Logs: Read** - Grants read access to logs using Logpull or Instant Logs.

*   **Logs: Write** - Grants read and write access to Logpull and Logpush, and read access to Instant Logs.

For zone scoped datasets, tokens must be zone scoped. For account scoped datasets, tokens must be account scoped.
{{</Aside>}}

## Roles

**Super Administrators**, **Administrators** and the **Log Share** roles have full access to Logpull, Logpush and Instant Logs.

The **Administrator Read only** and **Log Share Reader** roles only have access to Instant Logs and Logpull. This role does not have permissions to view the configuration of Logpush jobs.
