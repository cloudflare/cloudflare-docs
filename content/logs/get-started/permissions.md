# Permissions

Below is a description of the available permissions for tokens and roles as they relate to Logs. For information about how to create an API token, refer to [Creating API tokens](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/).

## Tokens

*   **Logs: Read** - Grants read access to logs using Logpull or Instant Logs.

*   **Logs: Write** - Grants read and write access to Logpull and Logpush, and read access to Instant Logs.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}
For zone scoped datasets, tokens must be zone scoped. For account scoped datasets, tokens must be account scoped.
{{</Aside>}}

## Roles

**Super Administrator**, **Administrator** and the **Log Share** roles have full access to Logpull, Logpush and Instant Logs. 

Only roles with **Log Share** edit permissions can read and configure Logpush jobs because job configurations may contain sensitive information.

The **Administrator Read only** and **Log Share Reader** roles only have access to Instant Logs and Logpull. This role does not have permissions to view the configuration of Logpush jobs.
