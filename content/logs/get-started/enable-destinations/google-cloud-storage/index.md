# Enable Logpush to Google Cloud Storage

Cloudflare Logpush supports pushing logs directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) via the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.

## Manage via the Cloudflare dashboard

{{<render file="_enable-logpush-job.md">}}

5. In **Select a destination**, choose **Google Cloud Storage**. 

6. Enter or select the following destination details:
    - **Bucket** - GCS bucket name
    - **Path** - bucket location within the storage container
    - **Organize logs into daily subfolders** (recommended) 
    - For **Grant Cloudflare access to upload files to your bucket**, make sure your bucket has added Cloudflareâ€™s IAM as a user with a [Storage Object Admin role](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles).

When you are done entering the destination details, select **Continue**.

7. To prove ownership, Cloudflare will send a file to your designated destination. To find the token, select the **Open** button in the **Overview** tab of the ownership challenge file, then paste it into the Cloudflare dashboard to verify your access to the bucket. Enter the **Ownership Token** and select **Continue**. 

8. Select the dataset to push to the storage service.

9. In the next step, you need to configure your logpush job:
    - Enter the **Job name**.
    - Under **If logs match**, you can select the events to include and/or remove from your logs. Refer to [Filters](/logs/reference/filters/) for more information. Not all datasets have this option available.
    - In **Send the following fields**, you can choose to either push all logs to your storage destination or selectively choose which logs you want to push.

10. In **Advanced Options**, you can:
    - Choose the format of timestamp fields in your logs (`RFC3339`(default),`Unix`, or `UnixNano`).
    - Select a [sampling rate](/logs/get-started/api-configuration/#sampling-rate) for your logs or push a randomly-sampled percentage of logs.
    - Enable redaction for `CVE-2021-44228`. This option will replace every occurrence of `${` with `x{`.

11. Select **Submit** once you are done configuring your logpush job.

## Create and get access to a GCS bucket

Cloudflare uses Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to gain access to your bucket. The Cloudflare IAM service account needs admin permission for the bucket.

To enable Logpush to GCS:

1. Create a GCS bucket. Refer to [instructions from GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-console).

2. In **Storage** > **Browser** > **Bucket** > **Permissions**, add the member `logpush@cloudflare-data.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with `Storage Object Admin` permission.
