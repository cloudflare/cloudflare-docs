# Filters

To filter the data shown on Web Analytics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select the **Analytics & Logs** drop-down and choose **Web Analytics**.
3. Select the website you want to check.
4. Select **Add filter**.
5. In the **New filter** box, choose your criteria from the dropdown.
6. Select **Apply**.

By default, Web Analytics shows you the previous 24 hours of data. To change the time period shown, use the drop-down menu above the graph. You can also select and drag the cursor on the graph to choose a time period.

Scroll below the graph for a breakdown of top visits by country and visits by source.
