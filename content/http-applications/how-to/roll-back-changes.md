# Roll back changes

Even after [testing](/http-applications/how-to/test-version-staging/) your configuration changes in your staging environment, you may need to roll back changes that you have applied to your production traffic.

To revert your configuration to a previous version, [edit](/http-applications/how-to/manage-routing-rules/#delete-routing-rules) your **Production** routing rule and update the version used for **Application version**.
