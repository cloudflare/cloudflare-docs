When you create a new HTTP application, Cloudflare copies all the configuration settings from an existing zone and creates the first version of your application:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account.
3. Go to **HTTP Applications**.
4. Click **Create an Application**.
5. Enter an **Application name**.
6. Select a website to copy its configuration for the first version of your application.
7. Click **Create**. The application may take a few minutes to be created.
