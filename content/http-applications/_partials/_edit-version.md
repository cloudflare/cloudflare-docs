When you edit an application version, Cloudflare updates the edge configuration settings associated with that version. You can only update the configuration settings associated with your most recent version.

To edit the edge configuration settings for a version:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account.
3. Go to **HTTP Applications**.
4. Select an existing application.
5. On a specific version, click **Edit**
6. Adjust your edge configuration settings (any changes you make are saved automatically).
7. To go directly to editing routing rules, click **Go to Routing Rules**.
