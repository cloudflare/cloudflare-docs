# Use Aegis with Data Localization Suite

[Data Localization Suite (DLS)](/data-localization/) is an enterprise add-on that enables you to choose the location where Cloudflare encrypts, decrypts, and stores data.

To ensure egress will happen from DLS-specified locations, make sure you have Aegis IPs provisioned in those locations. Refer to [IPs allocation](/aegis/about/ips-allocation/) for details.
