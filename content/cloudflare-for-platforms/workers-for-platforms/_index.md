# Workers for Platforms

Workers for Platforms is built on top of [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). Workers for Platforms extends the capabilities of Cloudflare Workers to SaaS businesses that want to deploy Worker scripts on behalf of their customers or let their users write Worker scripts directly.

Workers for Platforms allows you to:

* Run your own code as a wrapper around your users code.
* Create custom routing logic.
* Logically group your code separately from your usersâ€™ code.
* Use additional APIs like script tags for bulk operations.
* Surpass Workers' 500 script/account limit.
