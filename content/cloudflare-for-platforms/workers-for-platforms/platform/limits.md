# Limits

## Script limits

Cloudflare provides an unlimited number of scripts for our Workers for Platforms customers.
​​
## Bindings

You can use Workers [bindings](/workers/platform/bindings) with the dynamic dispatch Worker or any namespaced Workers. Your User Workers cannot be defined as Durable Objects. User Workers can have a Durable Objects binding.  

Bindings for your Dispatch Worker or any User Workers can be defined on multipart script uploads in the metadata blob.


Note: Any product specific limits still apply to your account (eg. the 100 KV namespace limit) 
Please fill out the Limit Increase Request form if you would like them increased. 

## ​Tags

You can set a maximum of eight tags per script. Avoid special characters like `,` and `&` when naming your tag.
