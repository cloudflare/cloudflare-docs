# Outbound Workers

Outbound Workers sit between your customerâ€™s Workers and the public Internet. They give you visibility into all outgoing `fetch()` requests from user Workers.

![Outbound Workers diagram information](/images/cloudflare-for-platforms/outbound-worker-diagram.png)

## General Use Cases

Outbound Workers can be used to:

- Log all subrequests to identify malicious hosts or usage patterns.
- Create, allow, or block lists for hostnames requested by user Workers.
- Configure authentication to your APIs behind the scenes (without end developers needing to set credentials).

## Use Outbound Workers

To use Outbound Workers:

1. Create a Worker intended to serve as your Outbound Worker.
2. Outbound Worker can be specified as an optional parameter in the [dispatch namespaces](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/configuration/#2-create-dispatch-namespace) binding in a project [wrangler.toml](/workers/wrangler/configuration/). Optionally, to pass data from your dynamic dispatch Worker to the Outbound Worker, the variable names must be specified under **parameters**.  

Make sure that you have `wrangler@3.3.0` or later [installed](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[[dispatch_namespaces]]
binding = "dispatcher"
namespace = "<NAMESPACE_NAME>"
outbound = {service = "<SERVICE_NAME>", parameters = ["customer_name","url"]}
```

3. Edit your dynamic dispatch Worker to call the Outbound Worker and declare variables to pass on `dispatcher.get()`.

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
export default {
  // this event is fired when the dispatched Workers make a subrequest
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // env contains the values we set in `dispatcher.get()`
    const customer_name = env.customer_name;
    const original_url = env.url;

    // log the request
    ctx.waitUntil(fetch(
      'https://logs.example.com',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          customer_name,
          original_url,
        }),
      },
    ));

    const url = new URL(original_url);
    if (url.host === 'api.example.com') {
      // pre-auth requests to our API
      const jwt = make_jwt_for_customer(customer_name);

      let headers = new Headers(request.headers);
      headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${jwt}`);

      // clone the request to set new headers using existing body
      let new_request = new Request(request, {headers});

      return fetch(new_request)
    }

    return fetch(request)
  }
};
```

4. The Outbound Worker will now be invoked on any `fetch()` requests from a user Worker. The user Worker will trigger a [FetchEvent](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event/) on the Outbound Worker. The variables declared in the binding can be accessed in the Outbound Worker through `env.<VAR_NAME>`.

Outbound Workers do not intercept fetch requests from Service Bindings or mTLS certificate bindings.
