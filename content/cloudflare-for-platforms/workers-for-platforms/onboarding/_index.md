# Onboarding Guide 

Most interaction with Workers for Platforms will happen through our APIs since you will be deploying Workers whenever a user on your end takes an action. Any scripts uploaded to a dispatch namespace will not appear on the Cloudflare dashboard. Prior to using Workers for Platforms, [generate an API token](/api/tokens/create/#generating-the-token) or [obtain your API key](/api/keys/#view-your-api-key).
