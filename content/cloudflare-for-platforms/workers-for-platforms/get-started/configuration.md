# Configure Workers for Platforms

This guide will instruct you on setting up Workers for Platforms. You will configure a [dispatch namespace](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/learning/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dispatch-namespace), a [dynamic dispatch Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/learning/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker) and a [user Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/learning/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers) to test a request end to end. This guide assumes that you already have a Cloudflare account. If you do not have a Cloudflare account, sign up before continuing.

## Prerequisite: Enable Workers for Platforms

Workers for Platforms is available for Enterprise customers only. To enable Workers for Platforms, contact your Cloudflare account team.

---

## 1. Install Wrangler

Installing `wrangler`, the Workers command-line interface (CLI), allows you to create and manage Worker projects.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Workers for Platforms requires a Wrangler version of `2.0.28` or higher.

{{</Aside>}}

To install [`wrangler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler), ensure you have [`npm` installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started), preferably using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Using a version manager helps avoid permission issues and allows you to easily change Node.js versions. Then run:

```sh
$ npm install -g wrangler
```

or install with `yarn`:

```sh
$ yarn global add wrangler
```

Refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) for more information.

## 2. Create dispatch namespace 

Create a [dispatch namespace](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/learning/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dispatch-namespace). A dispatch namespace is made up of a collection of user Workers. User Workers are Workers that your end users (end developers) create.

To create a dispatch namespace, run:

```sh
$ wrangler dispatch-namespace create <NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

## 3. Create a dynamic dispatch Worker

Create a [dynamic dispatch Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/learning/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker). The dynamic dispatch Worker calls user Workers from the dispatch namespace and executes them.

To create a dynamic dispatch Worker, you must create a Worker and bind it to the dispatch namespace you created in the previous step.

To create a Worker, run `wrangler init` followed by your Worker project name:

```sh
$ wrangler init <YOUR_WORKER>
```

To create a dynamic dispatch Worker, create a [binding](/workers/platform/bindings/). Open the [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) file in your project directory and add the following code block. Your `binding` is set by you (in the following code block, `dispatcher`). Add the `namespace` value by inputting the name of the dispatch namespace you created in step 2:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[[dispatch_namespaces]]
binding = "dispatcher"
namespace = "<NAMESPACE_NAME>"
```

Next, give your dynamic dispatch Worker the logic it needs to manage user Workers. Open your `index.ts` file and add the following code block:

* `dispatcher` is the binding you created earlier in this step.
* `customer-worker-1` is a script you will upload to the dispatch namespace in the next step.

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
export default {
  async fetch(req, env) {
    const worker = env.dispatcher.get("customer-worker-1");
    return await worker.fetch(req);
  }
}
```

Refer to [Create a dynamic dispatch Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/dynamic-dispatch/) for more configuration information.

## 4. Upload user Workers to a namespace

[User Workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/learning/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers) are written by end developers. End developers can deploy user Workers to script automated actions, create integrations or modify response payload to return custom content.

You will now upload `customer-worker-1` into your dispatch namespace that you created in step 2. This user Worker has a simple `fetch()` handler that sends a `Hello world` response.

You will use the Cloudflare API to upload the user Worker. This will upload the user Worker to a dispatch namespace. User Workers must be uploaded via the Cloudflare API as Wrangler does not support this operation. Workers uploaded this way will appear in Account Home > your account > **Workers for Platforms** > your namespace.

Update the necessary fields and run the following command:

1. Add your Cloudflare account email to the value of the `X-Auth-Email` header.
2. Find your `<AUTH_KEY>` by logging in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) > user icon > **My Profile** > **API Tokens** > **Global API Key** > **View**.
3. Add your Cloudflare account ID found in your site's **Overview**.
4. Add the namespace name you created in step 2 to `<NAMESPACE_NAME>`.
5. Add the script name `customer-worker-1` to `<SCRIPT_NAME>`.

```bash
curl -X PUT 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/workers/dispatch/namespaces/<NAMESPACE_NAME>/scripts/<SCRIPT_NAME>' \
-H 'X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>' \
-H 'X-Auth-Key: <AUTH_KEY> \
-H 'Content-Type: application/javascript' \
--data "addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response('Hello world');
}"
```

If you prefer to use an API token, remove the `X-Auth-Key` and `X-Auth-Email` headers. Create an [API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) and add the token to the `"Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"` header.

```bash
curl -X PUT 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/workers/dispatch/namespaces/<NAMESPACE_NAME>/scripts/<SCRIPT_NAME>' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/javascript' \
--data "addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  return new Response('Hello world');
}"
```

## 5. Test a request

You will now send a request to the route your dispatch Worker is on. You should receive the response (`Hello world`) you created in your user Worker (`customer-worker-1`) that you call from your dynamic dispatch Worker (the Worker you made in step 3).

To test your user Worker:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. In Account Home, select **Workers**.
3. Go to your dynamic dispatch Worker.
4. In the dynamic dispatch Worker, go to the link under **Preview**.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Dynamic dispatch Workers versus user Workers">}}

In the Cloudflare dashboard, dynamic dispatch Workers are found in **Workers**. User Workers can be found in **Workers for Platforms**.

By completing this guide, you have successfully set up a dispatch namespace, dynamic dispatch Worker and user Worker to test a request end to end.
