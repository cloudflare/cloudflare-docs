# Configure Workers for Platforms


## Prerequisites:

### Enable Workers for Platforms

To enable Workers for Platforms, you will need to purchase the [Workers for Platforms Paid plan](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/pricing/).

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-for-platforms), and select your account.
2. Complete the payment process for the Workers for Platforms Paid plan.

If you are an Enterprise customer, contact your Cloudflare account team to enable Workers for Platforms.

### Learn about Workers for Platforms

Refer to [How Workers for Platforms works](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/) to learn more about Workers for Platforms terminology and architecture.

---
This guide will instruct you on setting up Workers for Platforms. You will configure a [dispatch namespace](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dispatch-namespace), a [dynamic dispatch Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker) and a [user Worker](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers) to test a request end to end.

### 1. Create a user Worker

First, create a [user Workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers). User Workers are Workers that your end users (end developers) will be uploading.

User Workers can be created using C3. C3 (create-cloudflare-cli) is a command-line tool designed to help you setup and deploy Workers to Cloudflare as fast as possible.

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project. This example creates a user Worker called `customer-worker-1`.


```sh
$ npm create cloudflare@latest customer-worker-1 -- --type=hello-world
```

When following the interactive prompts, answer the questions as below:

- Select `no` to using TypeScript.
- **Select `no` to deploying your application.**

### 2. Create a dispatch namespace

Create a [dispatch namespace](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dispatch-namespace). A dispatch namespace is made up of a collection of [user Workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers).

This example creates a dispatch namespace called `testing`. To create a dispatch namespace, run:

```sh
$ npx wrangler dispatch-namespace create testing
```

### 3. Upload a user Worker to the dispatch namespace

Make sure you are in your user Worker's project directory:

```sh
$ cd customer-worker-1
```

To upload and deploy the user Worker to the dispatch namespace, running the following command:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy --dispatch-namespace testing
```

### 4. Create a dispatch Worker

[Dispatch Workers](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker) are used to execute user Workers from the dispatch namespace. You will now create a dispatch Worker and add logic it needs to route to the user Worker created in step 2.


Navigate up a level from your user Worker's project directory:
```sh
$ cd ..
```

Create your dispatch Worker. In this example, the dispatch Worker is called `my-dispatcher`.

{{<render file="_c3-run-command-with-directory.md" productFolder="workers" withParameters="my-dispatcher">}}

{{<render file="_c3-post-run-steps.md" productFolder="workers" withParameters="Hello World example;;Hello World Worker;;JavaScript">}}

Change to your project's directory:

```sh
$ cd my-dispatcher
```

Open the `wrangler.toml` file in your project directory, and add the dispatch namespace binding:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---

[[dispatch_namespaces]]
binding = "DISPATCHER"
namespace = "testing"
```

Add the following to the index.js file:

```js
---
filename: index.js
---
export default {
  async fetch(req, env) {
    const worker = env.DISPATCHER.get("customer-worker-1");
    return await worker.fetch(req);
  },
};
```

Deploy your dispatch Worker:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy
```

### 5. Test a request

You will now send a request to the route your dynamic dispatch Worker is on. You should receive the response (`Hello world`) you created in your user Worker (`customer-worker-1`) that you call from your dynamic dispatch Worker (`my-dispatcher`).

Preview the response to your Workers for Platforms project at `https://my-dispatcher.<YOUR_WORKER_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev/`.

By completing this guide, you have successfully set up a dispatch namespace, dynamic dispatch Worker and user Worker to test a request end to end.
