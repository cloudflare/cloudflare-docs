# Performance

Cloudflare for SaaS allows you to deliver the best performance to your end customers by helping enable you to reduce latency through:

* [Argo Smart Routing for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/performance/argo-for-saas/) calculates and optimizes the fastest path for requests to travel to your origin.
* [Early Hints for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/performance/early-hints-for-saas/) provides faster loading speeds for individual custom hostnames by allowing the broswer to begin loading responses while the origin server is compiling the full response.
* [Cache for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/performance/cache-for-saas/) makes customer websites faster by storing a copy of the websiteâ€™s content on the servers of our globally distributed data centers.
* By using Cloudflare for SaaS, your customers automatically inherit the benefits of Cloudflare's vast [Anycast network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/).
