# Set up apex proxying

To set up Cloudflare for SaaS for [apex proxying](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/advanced-settings/apex-proxying/) - as opposed to the [normal setup](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/) - perform the following steps.

## Initial setup

{{<render file="_get-started-initial-setup-preamble.md">}}
<br/>

### Step 1 - Get IP range

With apex proxying, you can either [bring your own IP range](/byoip/) or use a set of IP addresses provided by Cloudflare.

For more details on this step, reach out to your account team.

These IP addresses are different than those associated with your Cloudflare zone.

### Step 2 - Create fallback origin

## Per-hostname setup

{{<render file="_get-started-per-hostname.md" noMarkdown=true >}}

### Step 3 - Have customer create DNS record

To finish the custom hostname setup, your customer can set up either an `A` or `CNAME` record at their authoritative DNS provider.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

If you want your customers to be able to use `CNAME` records, you will need to complete the [normal setup process](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/) as well.

{{</Aside>}}

#### `A` record

If your customer uses an `A` record at their authoritative DNS provider, they need to point their hostname to the IP prefixed allocated for your account.

{{<render file="_get-started-check-statuses.md">}}

Your customer's `A` record might look like the following:

```txt
example.com.  60  IN  A   192.0.2.1
```

#### `CNAME` record

If your customer uses a `CNAME` record at their authoritative DNS, they need to point their hostname to your [`CNAME` target](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/#step-2-optional--create-cname-target) [^1].

{{<render file="_get-started-check-statuses.md">}}

Your customer's `CNAME` record might look like the following:

```txt
mystore.com CNAME customers.saasprovider.com
```
