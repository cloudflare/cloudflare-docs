# Enable Cloudflare for SaaS

To enable Cloudflare for SaaS for your account:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Custom Hostnames**.
4. Select **Enable**.
5. The next step depends on the zone's plan:
    - **Enterprise**: Can preview this product as a [non-contract service](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/non-contract-products/), which provide full access, free of metered usage fees, limits, and certain other restrictions.
    - **Non-enterprise**: Will have to enter payment information.
