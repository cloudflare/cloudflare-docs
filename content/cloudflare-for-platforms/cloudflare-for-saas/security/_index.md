# Security
 
Cloudflare for SaaS provides increased security per custom hostname through:
 
* [Certificate management](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/)
    * [Issue certificates through Cloudflare](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/)
    * [Upload your own certificates](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/custom-certificates/)
* Control your traffic's level of encryption with [TLS settings](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/enforce-mtls/)
* Create and deploy firewall rules, rate limiting rules, and managed rulesets using [WAF for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/waf-for-saas/)
