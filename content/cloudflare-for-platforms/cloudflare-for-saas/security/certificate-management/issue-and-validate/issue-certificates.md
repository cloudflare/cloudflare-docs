# Issue certificates

Cloudflare automatically issues certificates when you [create a custom hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/create-custom-hostnames/).

{{<render file="_issue-certs-preamble.md">}}

Refer to [this certificate authorities reference page](/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/) to learn more about the CAs that Cloudflare uses to issue SSL/TLS certificates.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

There are several required steps before a custom hostname and its certificate can become active. For more details, refer to our [Get started guide](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/).
