Cloudflare partners with $1 to provide $1 customers’ websites with Cloudflare’s performance and security benefits.

If you use $1 and also have a Cloudflare Enterprise plan, you can use your own Cloudflare Zone to proxy web traffic to your Zone first, then $1's (the SaaS Provider) Zone second. This configuration option is called [Orange-to-Orange (O2O)](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).
