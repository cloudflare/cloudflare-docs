If you would like to request an immediate recheck, [rather than wait for the next retry](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/validation-backoff-schedule/), send a [PATCH request](/api/operations/custom-hostname-for-a-zone-edit-custom-hostname) with the same values as your initial `POST` request.
