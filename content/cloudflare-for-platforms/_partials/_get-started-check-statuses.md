Before your customer does this step, confirm that the hostname's **Certificate status** and **Hostname status** are both **Active**. 

If not, confirm that you are using a method of [certificate](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/validate-certificates/http/#http-automatic) or [hostnames](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-validation/realtime-validation/) validation that occurs after your customer adds their DNS record.
