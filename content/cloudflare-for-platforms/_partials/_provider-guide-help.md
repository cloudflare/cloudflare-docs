If you are a $1 customer and have set up your own Cloudflare zone with O2O enabled on specific hostnames, contact your Cloudflare Account Team or [Cloudflare Support](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) for help resolving issues in your own zone.

Cloudflare will turn to $1 if there are technical issues that Cloudflare cannot resolve.
