If you are a $1 customer and have set up your own Cloudflare Zone with O2O enabled on specific hostnames, contact your Cloudflare Account Team or [Cloudflare Support](/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/contacting-cloudflare-support/) for help resolving issues in your own Zone.

Cloudflare will turn to $1 if there are technical issues that Cloudflare cannot resolve.
