# Issue certificates

Cloudflare automatically issues certificates when you [create a custom hostname](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/create-custom-hostnames/).

There are several required steps before a custom hostname and its certificate can become active. For more details, refer to our [Get started guide](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/).
