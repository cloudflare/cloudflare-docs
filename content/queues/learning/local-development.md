# Develop locally

Queues supports local development workflows using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the command-line interface for Workers. Wrangler runs the same version of Queues as Cloudflare runs globally.

## Requirements 

To develop locally with Queues, you must use [Wrangler v3.1.0](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wrangler3/) or later. Refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#update-wrangler) to learn how to update Wrangler.

Developing locally with Queues also requires a Node.js version of `18.0.0` or later. Consider using a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node versions.

Users new to Queues and/or Cloudflare Workers should visit the [Queues tutorial](/queues/get-started/) to install `wrangler` and deploy their first Queue.

To start a local development session:

```sh
# Confirm we are using wrangler v3.1.0+
$ wrangler --version
‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.1.0

# Start a local dev session:
$ wrangler dev

# Outputs:
------------------
wrangler dev now uses local mode by default, powered by üî• Miniflare and üë∑ workerd.
To run an edge preview session for your Worker, use wrangler dev --remote
‚éî Starting local server...
[mf:inf] Ready on http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

Local development sessions create a standalone, local-only environment that mirrors the production environment Queues runs in so that you can test your Workers _before_ you deploy to production.

Refer to the [`wrangler dev` documentation](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) to learn more about how to configure a local development session.

## Known Issues

Wrangler does not yet support running separate producer and consumer Workers bound to the same Queue locally. To develop locally with Queues, you can temporarily put your consumer's `queue()` handler in the same Worker as your producer, so the same Worker acts as both a producer and consumer. 

Wrangler also does not yet support `wrangler dev --remote`.
