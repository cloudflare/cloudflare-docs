Notes:

* <sup>1</sup> Request adjustments to limits that conflict with your project goals by contacting Cloudflare. To increase a limit, complete the [Limit Increase Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_fwAVOboH9SlutMonzbhCxuuuOmiU1L_I5O2CFbXf_XXMRg/viewform).
* <sup>2</sup> 1 KB is measured as 1000 bytes. Messages can include up to ~100 bytes of internal metadata that counts towards total message limits.
* <sup>3</sup> The maximum message throughput per queue will continue to increase during the beta period.
* <sup>4</sup> Exceeding the maximum message throughput will cause the `.send` and `.sendBatch` methods to throw an exception with a `Too Many Requests` error until your producer falls below the limit.
* <sup>5</sup> Messages in a queue that reach the maximum message retention are deleted from the queue. Queues does not delete messages in the same queue that have not reached this limit.
* <sup>6</sup> Individual queues that reach this limit will receive a `Storage Limit Exceeded` error when calling `.send` or `.sendBatch` on the queue.
