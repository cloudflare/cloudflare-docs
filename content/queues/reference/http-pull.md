# Pull consumers

A pull-based consumer allows you to pull from a queue over HTTP from any environment and/or programming language outside of Cloudflare Workers. A pull-based consumer can be useful when your message consumption rate is limited by upstream infrastructure or long-running tasks.

## Push or pull?

TODO - which one?

# Configuration

{{<Aside type="note" header="Retrieve an API bearer token">}}

To configure a pull-based consumer, you will need to create [an API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with both the `queues#read` and `queues#write` permissions. A consumer must be able to write to a queue to acknowledge messages.

{{</Aside>}}

1. Configure a consumer
2. Authenticate to the API
3. Pull messages 
4. Acknowledge messages

## Content types

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

When attaching a pull-based consumer to a queue, you should ensure that messages are sent with only a `text`, `bytes` or `json` [content type](/queues/reference/javascript-apis/#queuescontenttype).

Pull-based consumers cannot decode the `v8` content type as it is specific to the Workers runtime.

TODO - note on content types

# Examples

## TypeScript (Node.js)

The following example is a Node.js-based TypeScript application that pulls from a queue on startup, acknowledges messages after writing them to stdout, and polls the queue at a fixed interval.

In a production application, you could replace writing to stdout with inserting into a database, making HTTP requests to an upstream service, or writing to object storage.

```ts


```

## Go

The following example is a Go application that pulls from a queue on startup, acknowledges messages after writing them to stdout, and polls the queue at a fixed interval.

```go


```
