# WebSockets in Durable Objects

Durable Objects are a coordinated state tool for [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/), which are often used in parallel with [WebSockets](/workers/runtime-apis/websockets/) to persist state over multiple clients and connections. 

If your application needs to coordinate among multiple WebSocket connections, such as a chat room or game match, you will need to [create a Durable Object](/durable-objects/how-to/create-durable-object-stubs/) so clients send messages to a single-point-of-coordination. 

As part of Durable Objects, Workers can act as WebSocket endpoints â€“ including as a client or as a server.

WebSockets are most useful when combined with Durable Objects. When a client connects to your application using a WebSocket, you need a way for server-generated events to be sent back to the existing socket connection.

With Durable Objects, you can forward the WebSocket to a Durable Object. Messages can then be addressed to that Durable Object by its [unique ID](/durable-objects/how-to/access-durable-object-from-a-worker/#1-create-durable-object-ids), and the Durable Object can then forward those messages down the WebSocket to the client.

Durable Objects can use the web standard APIs described in [WebSockets](/workers/runtime-apis/websockets/use-websockets/). When using a Durable Object to terminate a WebSocket (as opposed to using it as a WebSocket client) the [Hibernatable WebSockets API](/durable-objects/api/websockets/) has significant advantages and should be preferred over the web standard APIs. 

Refer to [Cloudflare Edge Chat Demo](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo) for an example of WebSockets in action within Durable Objects.
