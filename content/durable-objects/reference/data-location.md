# Data location

You can restrict a Durable Object to a jurisdiction, or provide a location hint.

## Restrict Durable Objects to a jurisdiction

Durable Objects can be created so that they only run and store data within a specific jurisdiction to comply with local regulations such as the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) or [FedRAMP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-achieves-fedramp-authorization/). 

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Jurisdictions are available to all Durable Objects users. 
{{</Aside>}}

To use a jurisdiction, first create a jurisidictional subnamespace in your Worker's code:

```js
let subnamespace = OBJECT_NAMESPACE.jurisdiction('eu');
```

A jurisdictional subnamespace works like a normal Durable Object namespace (`OBJECT_NAMESPACE` above), except that IDs created within them permanently encode the jurisdiction that was used to create the subnamespace. Additionally, the `idFromString()` and `get()` methods will throw an exception if the IDs passed into them are not within the subnamespace's jurisdiction. Once you have a subnamespace, you can use all of the namespace methods documented above.

To create a new Durable Object ID that will only run and persist data within the jurisdiction:

```js
let id = subnamespace.newUniqueId();
```

To derive a unique Object ID from the given name string that will only run and persist data within the jurisdiction:

```js
let id = subnamespace.idFromName(name);
```

{{<Aside type="note" header="IDs derived from the same name but different jurisdictions will differ">}}

Because the jurisdiction is encoded permanently in the Durable Object ID, it is possible to have the same name represent different Durable Objects in different jurisdictions. For example: `OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('my-name')` and `OBJECT_NAMESPACE.jurisdiction('eu').idFromName('my-name')` represent different Durable Objects. They will have their own transient (in-memory) and persistent state, and will likely run in different geographical regions.

This may be counterintuitive at first, but it would be impossible to enforce two different non-overlapping jurisdictions for a single name. The key insight to remember is that Durable Object namespaces operate on IDs, not names, and the jurisdiction is a permanent part of the ID.

{{</Aside>}}

To parse a previously-created ID from a string:

```js
let id = subnamespace.idFromString(id);
```

To obtain an Object:

```js
let durableObjectStub = subnamespace.get(id)
```

While you cannot use an ID from a different jurisdiction in a subnamespace's `idFromString()` or `get()` methods, you can use any valid ID in the top-level namespace's methods. Object IDs created with a jurisdiction will still only run and persist data within the jurisdiction.

```js
let id = subnamespace.idFromName(name);

// This is valid.
OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromString(id.toString())

// And so is this.
OBJECT_NAMESPACE.get(id)
```

Your Workers may still access Durable Objects constrained to a jurisdiction from anywhere in the world. The jurisdiction constraint only controls where the Durable Object itself runs and persists data. Consider using [Regional Services](/data-localization/regional-services/) to control the regions from which Cloudflare responds to requests.

The currently supported jurisdictions are `eu` (the European Union) and `fedramp` (FedRAMP).

{{<Aside type="note" header="ID logging">}}

Durable Object IDs will be logged outside of the specified jurisdiction for billing and debugging purposes.

## Provide a location hint

Durable Objects, as with any stateful API, will often add response latency as requests must be forwarded to the data center where the Durable Object, or state, is located.

Durable Objects do not currently change locations after they are created<sup>1</sup>. By default, a Durable Object is instantiated in a data center close to where the initial `get()` request is made. This may not be in the same data center that the `get()` request is made from, but in most cases, it will be in close proximity.

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Initial requests to Durable Objects">}}

It can negatively impact latency to pre-create Durable Objects prior to the first client request or when the first client request is not representative of where the majority of requests will come from. It is better for latency to create Durable Objects in response to actual production traffic or provide explicit location hints.

{{</Aside>}}

Location hints are the mechanism provided to specify the location that a Durable Object should be located regardless of where the initial `get()` request comes from.

To manually create Durable Objects in another location, provide an optional `locationHint` parameter to `get()`. Only the first call to `get()` for a particular Object will respect the hint.

```js
let durableObjectStub = OBJECT_NAMESPACE.get(id, { locationHint: 'enam' });
```

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Hints are a best effort and not a guarantee. Unlike with jurisdictions, Durable Objects will not necessarily be instantiated in the hinted location, but instead instantiated in a data center selected to minimize latency from the hinted location.

The following locations are supported:

| Location Hint Parameter  | Location              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| wnam                     | Western North America |
| enam                     | Eastern North America |
| sam                      | South America         |
| weur                     | Western Europe        |
| eeur                     | Eastern Europe        |
| apac                     | Asia-Pacific          |
| oc                       | Oceania               |
| afr                      | Africa                |
| me                       | Middle East           |

<sup>1</sup> Dynamic relocation of existing Durable Objects is planned for the future.
