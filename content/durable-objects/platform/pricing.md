## Billing metrics

{{<render file="_durable_objects_pricing.md" productFolder="workers">}}

## Durable Objects billing examples

These examples exclude the costs for the Workers calling the Durable Objects. When modelling the costs of a Durable Object, note that:

* Inactive objects receiving no requests do not incur any duration charges.
* The [Hibernatable WebSocket API](/durable-objects/reference/websockets/#websocket-hibernation) can dramatically reduce duration-related charges for Durable Objects communicating with clients over the WebSocket protocol, especially if messages are only transmitted occassionally at sparse intervals.

### Example 1

This example represents a simple Durable Object used as a co-ordination service invoked via HTTP.

* A single Durable Object was called by a Worker 1.5 million times
* It is active for 1,000,000 seconds in the month

In this scenario, the estimated monthly cost would be calculated as:

**Requests**:
- (1.5 million requests - included 1 million requests) x $0.15 / 1,000,000 = $0.075

**Compute Duration**:
- 1,000,000 seconds \* 128 MB / 1 GB = 128,000 GB-s
- (128,000 GB-s - included 400,000 GB-s) x $12.50 / 1,000,000 = $0.00

**Estimated total**: ~$0.075 (requests) + $0.00 (compute duration) + minimum $5/mo usage = $5.08 per month

### Example 2

This example represents a moderately trafficked Durable Objects based application using WebSockets to broadcast game, chat or real-time user state across connected clients:

* 100 Durable Objects have 50 WebSocket connections established to each of them.
* Clients send approximately one message a minute for eight active hours a day, every day of the month.

In this scenario, the estimated monthly cost would be calculated as:

**Requests**:
- 50 requests to each of the 100 Durable Objects to establish the WebSockets (5,000 connections created each day, total 150,000 connection requests).
- 50 messages per minute \* 100 Durable Objects \* 60 minutes \* 8 hours \* 30 days = 72,000,000 requests + 150,000 connection requests.
- (~72 million requests - included 1 million requests) x $0.15 / 1,000,000 = $10.65.

**Compute Duration**:
- 100 Durable Objects \* 60 seconds \* 60 minutes \* 8 hours \* 30 days = 86,400,000 seconds.
- 86,400,000 seconds \* 128 MB / 1 GB = 11,059,200 GB-s.
- (11,059,200 GB-s - included 400,000 GB-s) x $12.50 / 1,000,000 = $133.24.

**Estimated total**: $10.65 (requests) + $133.24 (compute duration) + minimum $5/mo usage = $148.89 per month.

### Example 3

This example represents a horizontally scaled Durable Objects based application using WebSockets to communicate user-specific state to a single client connected to each Durable Object.

* 100 Durable Objects each have a single WebSocket connection established to each of them.
* Clients sent one message every second of the month so that the Durable Objects were active for the entire month.

In this scenario, the estimated monthly cost would be calculated as:

**Requests**:
- 100 requests to establish the WebSockets.
- 1 message per second \* 100 connections \* 60 seconds \* 60 minutes \* 24 hours \* 30 days = 259,200,000 requests
- (259.2 million requests - included 1 million requests) x $0.15 / 1,000,000 = $38.73

**Compute Duration**:
- 100 Durable Objects \* 60 seconds \* 60 minutes \* 24 hours \* 30 days = 259,200,000 seconds
- 259,200,000 seconds \* 128 MB / 1 GB = 33,177,600 GB-s
- (33,177,600 GB-s - included 400,000 GB-s) x $12.50 / 1,000,000 = $409.72

**Estimated total**: $38.73 (requests) + $409.72 (compute duration) = $453.45 per month

### Example 4

This example represents a moderately trafficked Durable Objects based application using WebSocket Hibernation to broadcast game, chat or real-time user state across connected clients:

* 100 Durable Objects each have 100 Hibernatable WebSocket connections established to each of them.
* Clients send one message per minute, and it takes 10ms to process a single message in the `webSocketMessage()` handler. Since each Durable Object handles 100 WebSockets, cumulatively each Durable Object will be actively executing JS for 1 second each minute (100 WebSockets * 10ms).

In this scenario, the estimated monthly cost would be calculated as:

**Requests**:
- 100 requests to each of the 100 Durable Objects to establish the WebSockets (10,000 initial connections).
- 100 messages per minute<sup>1</sup> \* 100 Durable Objects \* 60 minutes \* 24 hours \* 30 days = 432,000,000 requests
- (432 million requests - included 1 million requests) x $0.15 / 1,000,000 = $64.65

**Compute Duration**:
- 100 Durable Objects \* 1 second<sup>2</sup> \* 60 minutes \* 24 hours \* 30 days = 4,320,000 seconds
- 4,320,000 seconds \* 128 MB / 1 GB = 552,960 GB-s
- (552,960 GB-s - included 400,000 GB-s) x $12.50 / 1,000,000 = $1.91

**Estimated total**: $64.65 (requests) + $1.91 (compute duration) + Minimum $5/mo usage = $71.56 per month

<sup>1</sup> 100 messages per minute comes from the fact that 100 clients connect to each DO, and each sends 1 message per minute.

<sup>2</sup> The example uses 1 second because each Durable Object is active for 1 second per minute. This can also be thought of as 432 million requests that each take 10 ms to execute (4,320,000 seconds).
