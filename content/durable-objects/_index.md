# Cloudflare Durable Objects

{{<description>}}

A globally distributed coordination API with strongly consistent storage.

{{</description>}}

{{<plan type="paid">}}

Durable Objects provide a powerful API for coordinating multiple clients or users, each with private, transactional and strongly consistent storage attached.
