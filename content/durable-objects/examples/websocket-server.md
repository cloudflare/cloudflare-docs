This example shows how to build a WebSocket server using Durable Objects and Workers. The example exposes two endpoints, one to create new WebSockets, and another to check how many WebSockets are currently connected. For more information, refer to [Use Durable Objects with WebSockets](/durable-objects/reference/websockets/).

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

WebSocket connections pin your Durable Object to memory, and so duration charges will be incurred so long as the WebSocket is connected (regardless of activity). To avoid duration charges during periods of inactivity, use the [WebSocket Hibernation API](/durable-objects/examples/websocket-hibernation-server/), which only charges for duration when JavaScript is actively executing.

Finally, configure your `wrangler.toml` file to include a Durable Object [binding](/durable-objects/get-started/#5-configure-durable-object-bindings) and [migration](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) based on the namespace and class name chosen previously.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "websocket-server"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "WEBSOCKET_SERVER"
class_name = "WebSocketServer"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["WebSocketServer"]
```
