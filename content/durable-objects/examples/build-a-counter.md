This example shows how to build a counter using Durable Objects and Workers that can print, increment, and decrement a `name` provided by the URL query string parameter, for example, `?name=A`.

```js

filename: index.js

// Worker

export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    let url = new URL(request.url);
    let name = url.searchParams.get("name");
    if (!name) {
      return new Response(
        "Select a Durable Object to contact by using" +
          " the `name` URL query string parameter, for example, ?name=A"
      );
    }

    // Every unique ID refers to an individual instance of the Counter class that
    // has its own state. `idFromName()` always returns the same ID when given the
    // same string as input (and called on the same class), but never the same
    // ID for two different strings (or for different classes).
    let id = env.COUNTER.idFromName(name);

    // Construct the stub for the Durable Object using the ID. 
    // A stub is a client Object used to send messages to the Durable Object.
    let obj = env.COUNTER.get(id);

    // Send a request to the Durable Object, then await its response.
    let resp = await obj.fetch(request.url);
    let count = await resp.text();

    return new Response(`Durable Object '${name}' count: ${count}`);
  }
};

// Durable Object

export class Counter {
  constructor(state, env) {
    this.state = state;
  }

  // Handle HTTP requests from clients.
  async fetch(request) {
    // Apply requested action.
    let url = new URL(request.url);

    // Durable Object storage is automatically cached in-memory, so reading the
    // same key every request is fast. 
    // You could also store the value in a class member if you prefer.
    let value = (await this.state.storage.get("value")) || 0;

    switch (url.pathname) {
      case "/increment":
        ++value;
        break;
      case "/decrement":
        --value;
        break;
      case "/":
        // Serves the current value.
        break;
      default:
        return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
    }

    // You do not have to worry about a concurrent request having modified the value in storage. 
    // "input gates" will automatically protect against unwanted concurrency. 
    // Read-modify-write is safe. 
    await this.state.storage.put("value", value);

    return new Response(value);
  }
}

Finally, configure your `wrangler.toml` file to include a Durable Object [binding](/durable-objects/get-started/#5-configure-durable-object-bindings) and [migration](/durable-objects/reference/durable-objects-migrations/) based on the namespace and class name chosen previously.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "my-counter"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "COUNTER"
class_name = "Counter"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["Counter"]
```
