# Vector databases

Vector databases are a key part of building scalable AI-powered applications. They provide a form of “long term memory” on top of an existing ML model. Without a vector database, you would need to train your own model(s) or re-run your dataset through a model before making a query, which would be both slow and expensive.
## Databases

In Vectorize, a database and an index are the same concept: each index you create is separate from other indexes you create. Vectorize automatically manages optimizing and re-generating the index for you when you insert new data.
