## Binding to a Worker

[Bindings](/workers/configuration/bindings/) allow you to attach resources, including Vectorize indexes or [R2 buckets](/workers/configuration/bindings/#r2-bucket-bindings), to your Worker.

Bindings are defined in either the [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration associated with your Workers project, or via the Cloudflare dashboard for your project.

Refer to the [bindings documentation](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#vectorize-indexes) for an example.
