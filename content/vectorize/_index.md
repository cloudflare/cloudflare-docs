{{<description>}}

Build full-stack AI applications with Vectorize, Cloudflare's powerful vector database.

{{</description>}}

{{<plan type="workers-paid">}}

Vectorize is a globally distributed vector database that enables you to build full-stack, AI-powered applications with [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). Vectorize makes querying embeddings — representations of values or objects like text, images, audio that are designed to be consumed by machine learning models and semantic search algorithms — faster, easier and more affordable.

{{<render file="_vectorize-beta.md">}}

For example, by storing the embeddings (vectors) generated by a machine learning model, including those built-in to [Workers AI](/workers-ai/) or by bringing your own from platforms like [OpenAI](#), you can build applications with powerful search, similarity, recommendation, classification and/or anomaly detection capabilities based on your own data.

The vectors returned can reference images stored in Cloudflare R2, documents in KV, and/or user profiles stored in D1 — enabling you to go from vector search result to concrete object all within the Workers platform, and without standing up additional infrastructure.
