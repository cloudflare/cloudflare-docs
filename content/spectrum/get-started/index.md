# Get started

Spectrum is available on all paid plans. Pro and Business support selected protocols only, whereas Enterprise supports all TCP and UDP based traffic. Refer to [Configuration options](/spectrum/reference/configuration-options/) for more configuration details.

To create a Spectrum application, you can either use an IP address, a CNAME Record or a Load Balancer. Independently of the method you use, you can create the application through the dashboard or via [API](/api/operations/spectrum-applications-list-spectrum-applications).

## Create a Spectrum application using an IP address

To create a Spectrum application using an IP address, Cloudflare normally assigns you an arbitrary IP from Cloudflareâ€™s IP pool to your application. If you want to use your own IP addresses, you can use [BYOIP](/spectrum/about/byoip/) or you can also use a [Static IP](/spectrum/about/static-ip/). In these two last cases, you need to create your Spectrum application through the API, as these features are not available via dash. When using the API, the field `origin_direct` takes as input the IP address.

<div>

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2.  Select **Spectrum**.
3.  Select **Create an Application**. If this is your first time using Spectrum, the **Create an Application** modal appears.
4.  Select your **Application Type**.
5.  Under **Domain**, enter the domain that will use Spectrum.
6.  Under **Edge Port**, enter the port Cloudflare should use for your application.
7.  Under **Origin**, enter your application's origin IP and port.
8.  If your application requires the client IP and supports [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/), enable **Proxy Protocols**. Proxy Protocol is a method for a proxy like Cloudflare to send the client IP to the origin application.
9.  Select **Add**.

Below is a curl example and the associated data being posted to the API.

**API example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/023e105f4ecef8ad9ca31a8372d0c353/spectrum/apps" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: user@example.com" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: c2547eb745079dac9320b638f5e225cf483cc5cfdda41" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

```

## Create a Spectrum application using a CNAME record

To create a Spectrum application using a CNAME record, you will need to create a [CNAME record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/) on your Cloudflare hosted zone that points to your origin's hostname. This is required to resolve to your hostname origin. Refer to [Create DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records), for more information. When using a CNAME as an origin, note that Cloudflare needs to be authoritative for that zone. When using the API, the `origin_dns` field takes as input the CNAME record.

## Create a Spectrum application using a Load Balancer

To create a Spectrum application using a Load Balancer, you will need to generate a Load Balancer from the dashboard or via the API. Refer to the [Create a load balancer](/load-balancing/how-to/create-load-balancer/) workflow for help.

{{<Aside>}}

To prevent issues with DNS resolution for a Spectrum application, do not use the same Spectrum hostname as a current Load Balancing hostname.

## View traffic

You can now proxy traffic through Cloudflare without additional configuration. As you run traffic through Cloudflare, you will see the last minute of traffic from **Spectrum** in the dashboard.
