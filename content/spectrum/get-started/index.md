# Get started

Spectrum is available on all paid plans. Pro and Business support selected protocols only, whereas Enterprise supports all TCP and UDP based traffic. Refer to [Configuration options](/spectrum/reference/configuration-options/) for more configuration details.

To create a Spectrum application, you can either use an IP address, a CNAME Record or a load balancer. Independently of the method you use, you can create the application through the dashboard or via [API](/api/operations/spectrum-applications-list-spectrum-applications).

## Create a Spectrum application using an IP address

To create a Spectrum application using an IP address, Cloudflare normally assigns you an arbitrary IP from Cloudflareâ€™s IP pool to your application. If you want to use your own IP addresses, you can use [BYOIP](/spectrum/about/byoip/) or you can also use a [Static IP](/spectrum/about/static-ip/). In these two last cases, you need to create your Spectrum application through the API, as these features are not available via dash. When using the API, the field `origin_direct` takes as input the IP address.

{{<details header="Add your application via Dashboard">}}

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select **Spectrum**.
3. Select **Create an Application**. If this is your first time using Spectrum, the **Create an Application** modal appears.
4. Select your **Application Type**.
5. Under **Domain**, enter the domain that will use Spectrum.
6. Under **Edge Port**, enter the port Cloudflare should use for your application.
7. Under **Origin**, enter your application's origin IP and port.
8. If your application requires the client IP and supports [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/), enable **Proxy Protocols**. Proxy Protocol is a method for a proxy like Cloudflare to send the client IP to the origin application.
9. Select **Add**.

Below is a curl example and the associated data being posted to the API.

**API example:**

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/apps" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"protocol":"tcp/22","dns":{"type":"CNAME","name":"ssh.example.com"},"origin_direct":["tcp://192.0.2.1:22"],"proxy_protocol":"off","ip_firewall":true,"tls":"full","edge_ips":{"type":"dynamic","connectivity":"all"},"traffic_type":"direct","argo_smart_routing":true}'
```

**Example data:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": [],
  "result": {
    "id": "ea95132c15732412d22c1476fa83f27a",
    "protocol": "tcp/22",
    "dns": {

    },

      "tcp://192.0.2.1:22"
    ],
    "proxy_protocol": "off",
    "ip_firewall": true,
    "tls": "full",
    "edge_ips": {

    "modified_on": "2014-01-02T02:20:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Create a Spectrum application using a CNAME record

To create a Spectrum application using a CNAME record, you will need to create a [CNAME record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/) on your Cloudflare hosted zone that points to your origin's hostname. This is required to resolve to your hostname origin. Refer to [Create DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records), for more information. When using a CNAME as an origin, note that Cloudflare needs to be authoritative for that zone. When using the API, the `origin_dns` field takes as input the CNAME record.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select **Spectrum**.
3. Select **Create an Application**. If this is your first time using Spectrum, the **Create an Application** modal appears.
5. Select your **Application Type**.
6. Under **Domain**, enter the domain that will use Spectrum.
7. Under **Edge Port**, enter the port Cloudflare should use for your application.
8. Under **Origin**, enter your `CNAME` record name.
9. Select **Add**.

```

**Example data:**

{
  "dns": {

    "ttl": 1200
  },
  "origin_port": 22
}
```

## Create a Spectrum application using a load balancer

To create a Spectrum application using a load balancer, you will need to generate a load balancer from the dashboard or via the API. Refer to the [Load Balancing documentation](/load-balancing/additional-options/spectrum/#1-configure-your-load-balancer) for more details.

{{<Aside>}}

To prevent issues with DNS resolution for a Spectrum application, do not use the same Spectrum hostname as a current Load Balancing hostname.

## View traffic

You can now proxy traffic through Cloudflare without additional configuration. As you run traffic through Cloudflare, you will see the last minute of traffic from **Spectrum** in the dashboard.
