# Limitations

The following limitations apply to different protocols supported by Spectrum.

## UDP

At the moment, Cloudflare does not support packet fragmentation for UDP packets. If packets are fragmented, they will be dropped at Cloudflareâ€™s edge. 

## Minecraft

Minecraft Java Edition is supported but Minecraft Bedrock Edition is not supported.
