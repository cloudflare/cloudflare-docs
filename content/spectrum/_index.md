# Cloudflare Spectrum

Spectrum provides security and acceleration for any [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) or [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) based application. That means you can route MQTT, email, file transfer, version control, games, and more over TCP or UDP through Cloudflare to mask the origin and protect it from [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/). Refer to [DDoS Protection for Spectrum](/spectrum/about/ddos-for-spectrum/) to learn more about what L3/4 DDoS Protection is included as part of the Spectrum service.

Spectrum is available on all paid plans. Pro and Business support selected protocols only, and Enterprise supports all TCP and UDP based traffic. For information on how billing is calculated, refer to [Billing for Spectrum](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/360041721872) for an in-depth breakdown.
