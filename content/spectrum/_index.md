# Cloudflare Spectrum

Spectrum provides security and acceleration for any [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) or [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) based application. That means you can route MQTT, email, file transfer, version control, games, and more over TCP or UDP through Cloudflare to mask the origin and protect it from [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/). Refer to [DDoS Protection for Spectrum](/spectrum/about/ddos-for-spectrum/) to learn more about what L3/4 DDoS Protection is included as part of the Spectrum service.
