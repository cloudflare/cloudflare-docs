Setting up a static IP address to configure a DNS server may prevent you from connecting to some public WiFi networks that use captive portals â€” these are the web pages some wireless networks employ to let users log in and use their services.

If you are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals:
1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
2. Connect to the WiFi network.
3. Once the connection has been established, re-add the static IP addresses or enable the 1.1.1.1 app.
