# Cloudflare 1.1.1.1

1.1.1.1 is Cloudflare’s public DNS resolver. It offers a fast and private way to browse the Internet. [DNS resolvers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) translate domains like `cloudflare.com` into the IP addresses necessary to reach the website (like `104.16.123.96`).

Unlike most DNS resolvers, 1.1.1.1 does not sell user data to advertisers. 1.1.1.1 has also been measured to be the [fastest DNS resolver available](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers) — it is deployed in hundreds of cities worldwide, and has access to the addresses of millions of domain names on the same servers it runs on.

Beyond the regular service, 1.1.1.1 also offers a [version made for families](/1.1.1.1-for-families) with additional protection against malware and adult content, and an encrypted service through [DNS over HTTPS (DoH)](/encrypted-dns/dns-over-https) or [DNS over TLS (DoT)](/encrypted-dns/dns-over-tls) for increased security and privacy. You can also access 1.1.1.1 [as a Tor hidden service](/other-ways-to-use-1.1.1.1/dns-over-tor).

1.1.1.1 is completely free. Setting it up takes minutes and requires no special software.
