# Get started with Cloudflare Calls

{{<Aside type="note" header="Before you get started:">}}

You must first [create a Cloudflare account](/fundamentals/setup/account/create-account/).

{{</Aside>}}

## Create your first app

Every Calls App is a separate environment, so you can make one for development, staging and production versions for your product.
Either using [Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/calls), or the [API](/api/operations/calls-apps-create-a-new-app) create a Calls App. When you create a Calls App, you will get:

- App ID
- App Secret

These two combined will allow you to make API Calls from your backend server to Calls.
