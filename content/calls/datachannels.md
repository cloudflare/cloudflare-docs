# DataChannels

Since Cloudflare Calls is basically a pub/sub server for WebRTC that can scale up to many subscribers per publisher, it's fit for arbitrary data besides media too.

## Example

An example of DataChannels in action can be found in the [Calls Examples github repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/calls-examples/tree/main/echo-datachannels).
