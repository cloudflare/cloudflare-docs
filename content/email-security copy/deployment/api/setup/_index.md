# API deployment setup

When you first get started with Area 1, you will need to set up a way to connect your current mail environment with Area 1.

## BCC setup

Send messages to Area 1 via BCC configurations within your email provider:

   - [Google Workspace BCC setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/gsuite-bcc-setup/)
   - [Microsoft Exchange BCC setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/exchange-bcc-setup/)

## Journaling setup

 Send messages to Area 1 via a Journaling configuration within your email provider:

   - [Office 365 journaling setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/office365-journaling/)

## Microsoft Graph API

Send messages to Area 1 via a Microsoft Graph API configuration within your email provider:
 
 - [Office 365 Microsoft Graph API setup](/email-security/deployment/api/setup/office365-graph-api/)

## Next steps

Regardless of your setup (BCC, journaling or MS Graph API), you may also want to set up either manual or automatic [retraction](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/) to take post-delivery actions against suspicious messages.
