The Cloudflare Workers platform supports [multiple languages](/workers/languages/), including TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust and Python. This guide shows you how to query a D1 database from [Python](/workers/languages/python/) and deploy your application globally.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Support for Python in Cloudflare Workers is in beta. Review the [documentation on Python support](/workers/languages/python/) to understand how Python works within the Workers platform.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should:

1. Review the [D1 tutorial](/d1/get-started/) for TypeScript and JavaScript to learn how to **create a D1 database and configure a Workers project**.
2. Refer to the [Python language guide](/workers/languages/python/) to understand how Python support works on the Workers platform.
3. Have basic familiarity with the Python language.

If you are new to Cloudflare Workers, refer to the [Get started guide](/workers/get-started/guide/) first before continuing with this example.

## Query from Python

This example assumes you have an existing D1 database. To allow your Python Worker to query your database, you first need to create a [binding](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) between your Worker and your D1 database and define this in your `wrangler.toml` configuration file.

You will need the `database_name` and `database_id` for a D1 database. You can use the `wrangler` CLI to create a new database or fetch the ID for an existing database as follows:

```sh
# Create a database
$ npx wrangler d1 create my-first-db

# Retrieve the database ID for an existing database
$ npx wrangler d1 info some-existing-db

# This will output a table with the database name and ID - for example:
# -------------------
# ┌───────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
# │                   │ c89db32e-83f4-4e62-8cd7-7c8f97659029 │
# ├───────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
# │ name              │ db-enam                              │
# ├───────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
# │ created_at        │ 2023-06-12T16:52:03.071Z             │
# └───────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Configure bindings

In your `wrangler.toml` file, create a new `[[d1_databases]]` configuration block and set `database_name` and `database_id` to the name and id (respectively) of the D1 database you want to query:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "python-and-d1"
main = "src/entry.py"
compatibility_flags = ["python_workers"] # Required for Python Workers
compatibility_date = "2024-03-29"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # This will be how you refer to your database in your Worker
database_name = "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"
database_id = "YOUR_DATABASE_ID"
```

The value of `binding` is how you will refer to your database from within your Worker. If you change this, you must change this in your Worker script as well.

### 2. Create your Python Worker

To create a Python Worker, create an empty file at `src/entry.py`, matching the value of `main` in your `wrangler.toml` file with the contents below:

```python
---
filename: src/entry.py
---
from js import Response

async def on_fetch(request, env):
    # Do anything else you'd like on request here!

    # Query D1 - we'll list all tables in our database in this example
    results = await env.DB.prepare("PRAGMA table_list").all()
    # Return a JSON response
    return Response.json(results)

```

The value of `binding` in your `wrangler.toml` file exactly must match the name of the variable in your Python code. This example refers to the database via a `DB` binding, and query this binding via `await env.DB.prepare(...)`.

You can then deploy your Python Worker directly:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy

# Example output
#
# Your worker has access to the following bindings:
# - D1 Databases:
#   - DB: db-enam (c89db32e-83f4-4e62-8cd7-7c8f97659029)
# Total Upload: 0.18 KiB / gzip: 0.17 KiB
# Uploaded python-and-d1 (4.93 sec)
# Published python-and-d1 (0.51 sec)
#   https://python-and-d1.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
# Current Deployment ID: 80b72e19-da82-4465-83a2-c12fb11ccc72
```

Your Worker will be available at `https://python-and-d1.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev`.

If you receive an error deploying:

* Make sure you have configured your `wrangler.toml` with the `database_id` and `database_name` of a valid D1 database.
* Ensure `compatibility_flags = ["python_workers"]` is set in your `wrangler.toml`, which is required for Python.
* Review the [list of error codes](/workers/observability/errors/), and ensure your code does not throw an uncaught exception.

## Next steps

* Refer to [Workers Python documentation](/workers/languages/python/) to learn more about how to use Python in Workers.
* Review the [D1 client API](/d1/build-with-d1/d1-client-api/) and how to query D1 databases.
* Learn [how to import data](/d1/build-with-d1/import-export-data/) to your D1 database.
