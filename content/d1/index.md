# Cloudflare D1 documentation

Built on SQLite, D1 is Cloudflareâ€™s first [queryable relational database at the edge](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1/). Create an entire database in a few quick steps by importing data or defining your tables and writing your queries within a Worker or through our API. With D1 you can: 
  
* Interact with and push changes to your database directly through Wrangler
* Create and modify your database directly from the D1 dashboard 
* Store backups of your database in R2 automatically
* Export your backups to download to your local machine. 

With D1 currently in Alpha, you can truly go full-stack and build rich apps including eCommerce sites, accounting software, SaaS solutions, CRMs and more.
