# Limits

While D1 is in Alpha, there are some limits to be aware of prior to begin testing.

* **Database size**: You can have a max database size of 100 MB. There are no limitations on rows and columns as long as your database falls within the size limitation.
* **Databases per account**: Create up to 10 D1 databases on a single account. If you need more, reach out to the team.
* **Backups**: Backups automatically run every hour. Backups will block access to the DB while theyâ€™re running. In most cases this should only be a second or two, and any requests that arrive during the backup will be queued.
