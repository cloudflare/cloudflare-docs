# Community Projects  
During our alpha period, members of our developer community have made some valuable contributions to the D1 ecosystem. Below are some useful projects to use throughout development 

{{<Aside type="note">}}
  Community projects are not maintained by the Cloudflare D1 team. They are managed and updated by the project authors.

## Projects

### d1-orm
An Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a way for you to query and manipulate data by using JavaScript. Created by a Cloudflare Discord Community Champion, the `d1-orm` seeks to provide a strictly typed experience while using D1.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/Interactions-as-a-Service/d1-orm/issues)
* [Documentation](https://docs.interactions.rest/d1-orm/)

### workers-qb
This is a zero-dependency query builder that provides a simple standardized interface while keeping the benefits and speed of using raw queries over a traditional ORM. While not intended to provide ORM-like functionality, `workers-qb` makes it easier to interact with the database from code for direct SQL access.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/G4brym/workers-qb)
* [Documentation](https://workers-qb.massadas.com/)

### d1-console 
Instead of running the `wrangler d1 execute` command in your terminal every time you want to interact with your database, you can interact with D1 from within the `d1-console`. Created by a Discord Community Champion, this gives the benefit of executing multi-line queries, obtaining command history, and viewing a cleanly formatted table output.

### D1 adapter for Kysely
Kysely is a type-safe and autocompletion-friendly typescript SQL query builder. With this adapter you can interact with D1 with the familiar Kysely interface
