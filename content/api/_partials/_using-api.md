Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. [Create an API token](/api/get-started/create-token/) to grant access to the API to perform actions.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

You can also authenticate with [API keys](/api/get-started/keys/), but these keys have [several limitations](/api/get-started/keys/#limitations) that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.
