## Verify your selection

The token summary screen shows all the resources and permissions the token will have before creating the token and seeing the token's secret.

If there are any issues you can go back and make adjustments. Even if after creating and using the token modifications need to be made, a token can be edited after creation.

Once you have verified the token is as desired, select **Create Token** to proceed to generating the token's secret.
