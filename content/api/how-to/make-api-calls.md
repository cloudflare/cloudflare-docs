# Make API calls

Once you create your API token, all API requests are authorized in the same way. Cloudflare uses the [RFC standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1) `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>` interface. An example request is shown below.

```bash
$ curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YQSn-xWAQiiEh9qM58wZNnyQS7FUdoqGIUAbrh7T"
```

Never send or store your API token secret in plaintext. Also be sure not to check it into code repositories, especially public ones.

## Using Cloudflareâ€™s APIs

Every Cloudflare API element is fixed to a version number. The latest version is Version 4. The stable base URL for all Version 4 HTTPS endpoints is: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/`

For specific guidance on making API calls, refer to the following resources:

*   The product's [Developer Docs section](/products/) for how-to guides.
*   [API schema docs](https://api.cloudflare.com) for request and response payloads for each endpoint.
*   If you are using [golang](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go) or [Hashicorp's Terraform](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare), use our first-party libraries to integrate with Cloudflare's API.
