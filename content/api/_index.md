# Cloudflare's API

Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions they have. Create an API token to grant access to the API to perform actions. Refer to [creating an API token](/api/get-started/#create-an-api-token) for more information.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

API keys allow for less granular access and each user can only have one. For these reasons, we advise customers using API keys to transition to using API tokens.
