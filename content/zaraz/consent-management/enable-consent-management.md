# Enable the Consent Management platform (CMP)

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Zaraz** > **Consent**.
3. Turn on **Enable Consent Management**.
4. In **Consent modal text** fill in any legal information required in your country. Use HTML code to format your information as you would in any other HTML editor.
5. Under **Purposes**, select **Add new Purpose**. Give your new purpose a name and a description. Purposes are the reasons for using third-party tools in your website.
6. In **Assign purpose to tools**, match tools to purposes by selecting one of the purposes previously created from the drop-down menu. Do this for all your tools.
7. Select **Save**.

Your Consent Management platform is ready. Your website should now display a modal asking for consent for the tools you have configured.

## Adding different languages

In your Zaraz consent settings, you can add your consent modal text and purposes in various languages.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Zaraz** > **Consent**.
3. Select a default language of your choice. The default setting is English.
4. In **Consent modal text** and **Purposes**, you can select different languages and add translations.

## Next steps

If the default consent modal does not suit your website's design, you can use the [Custom CSS tool](/zaraz/consent-management/custom-css/) to add your own custom design.
