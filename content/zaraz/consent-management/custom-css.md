# Custom CSS

You can add custom CSS to the Zaraz Consent Management Platform, to make the consent modal more in-line with your website's design. 

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Zaraz** > **Consent**.
3. Find the **Custom CSS** section, and add your custom CSS code as you would on any other HTML editor.
