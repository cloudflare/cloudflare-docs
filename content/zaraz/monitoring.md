# Zaraz Monitoring

Zaraz Monitoring shows you different metrics regarding Zaraz. This helps you to detect issues when they occur. For example, if a third-party analytics provider stops collecting data, you can use the information presented by Zaraz Monitoring to find where in the workflow the problem occurred.

You can also check activity data in the **Activity last 24hr** section, when you access [tools](/zaraz/get-started/add-tool/), [actions](/zaraz/get-started/create-actions/) and [triggers](/zaraz/get-started/create-trigger/) in the dashboard.
