# E-commerce

You can use `zaraz.ecommerce()` anywhere inside the `<body>` tag of a page.

`zaraz.ecommerce()` allows you to track common events of the e-commerce user journey, such as when a user adds a product to cart, starts the checkout funnel or completes an order on your website. It is an `async` function, so you can choose to `await` it if you would like to make sure it completed before running other code.

To start using `zaraz.ecommerce()`, you first need to enable it in your Zaraz account and on the tool you plan to send e-commerce data to. Then, add `zaraz.ecommerce()` to the `<body>` element of your website.

Right now, Zaraz is compatible with Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics), Google Analytics 4, Bing and Facebook Pixel.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Note">}}It is crucial you follow the guidelines set by third-party tools, such as Google Analytics 3 and Google Analytics 4, to ensure compliance with their limitations on payload size and length. For instance, if your `Order Completed` call includes a large number of products, it may exceed the limitations of the selected tool.{{</Aside>}}

## Enable e-commerce tracking

You do not need to map e-commerce events to triggers. Zaraz will automatically forward data using the right format to the tools with e-commerce support.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. Select **Zaraz** > **Settings**.
3. Enable **E-commerce tracking**.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Go to **Zaraz** > **Tools Configuration** > **Third-party tools**.
6. Locate the tool you want to use with e-commerce tracking and select **Edit**.
7. Select **Settings**.
8. Under **Advanced**, enable **E-commerce tracking**.
9. Select **Save**.

E-commerce tracking is now enabled. If you add additional tools to your website that you want to use with `zaraz.ecommerce()`, you will need to repeat steps 6-9 for that tool.

## Add e-commerce tracking to your website

After enabling e-commerce tracking on your Zaraz dashboard, you need to add `zaraz.ecommerce()` to the `<body>` element of your website:

```js
zaraz.ecommerce('Event Name', { parameters });
```

To create a complete tracking event, you need to add an event and one or more parameters. Below you will find a list of events and parameters Zaraz supports, as well as code examples for different types of events.
