# Zaraz Ecommerce

`zaraz.ecommerce()` allows you to track common events of the ecommerce user journey, such as when a user adds a product to cart, starts the checkout funnel or completes an order on your website.

To start using `zaraz.ecommerce()`, you first need to enable it in your Zaraz account and on the tool you plan to send ecommerce data to. Then, add `zaraz.ecommerce()` to the `<body>` element of your website.

## Enable ecommerce tracking

You do not need to map ecommerce events to triggers. Zaraz will automatically forward data using the right format to the tools with ecommerce support.

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and website.
2.  Click **Zaraz** > **Settings**.
3.  Enable **Ecommerce tracking**.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Locate the tool you want to use with ecommerce tracking and click **Edit**.
6.  Click **Settings**.
7.  Under **Advanced**, enable **Ecommerce tracking**.
8.  Click **Save**.

## Add ecommerce tracking to your website

After enabling ecommerce tracking on your Zaraz dashboard, you need to add `zaraz.ecommerce()` to the `<body>` element of your website:

```js
zaraz.ecommerce('Event Name', {parameters})
```

To create a complete tracking event, you need to add an event and one or more parameters. Below you will find a list of events and parameters Zaraz supports, as well as code examples for different types of events.
