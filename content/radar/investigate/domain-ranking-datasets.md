# Domains ranking

Cloudflare regularly generates a domain ranking based on DNS queries to [1.1.1.1](/1.1.1.1/),  Cloudflare's public DNS resolver.  Refer to the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-domain-rankings/) for a deep dive. In short, Cloudflare generates two types of listings:

- An ordered list of the top 100 most popular domains globally and per country. This includes the last 24 hours and is updated daily.
- An unordered global most popular domains dataset, divided into buckets of the following number of domains: 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000. It includes the last seven days and is updated weekly.

## Example: Get the current ordered top domains in the Cloudflare ranking

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/radar/ranking/top?name=top&format=json&limit=5" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "domain": "google.com"
},
{
  "rank": 2,
  "domain": "googleapis.com"
},
{
  "rank": 3,
  "domain": "facebook.com"
},
{
  "rank": 4,
  "domain": "gstatic.com"
},
{
  "rank": 5,
  "domain": "apple.com"
}
```

For more information refer to [Get Domains Rank top](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-ranking-get-domains-rank-top).

## Example: Get the last top `x` ranking bucket

As mentioned in the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-domain-rankings/), Cloudflare provides an ordered rank for the top 100 domains, but for the remainder it only provides ranking buckets â€” like top 200 thousand, top one million, etc.. These are available through Cloudflare's [datasets endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-datasets-get-datasets).

In the following example we will request the last available domain ranking buckets:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/radar/datasets?limit=5&offset=0&datasetType=RANKING_BUCKET&format=json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

```json
"datasets": [
  {
    "id": 72,
    "title": "Top 1000000 ranking domains",
    "description": "Unordered top 1000000 from 2022-10-24 to 2022-10-31",
    "type": "RANKING_BUCKET",
    "tags": [
      "GLOBAL",
      "top_1000000"
    ],
    "meta": {
      "top": 1000000
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

If you are interested in a specific top (like the top one million), go through the `meta.top` property. After finding the top you are looking for, get its `id` to fetch the dataset using the [`GET dataset`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-datasets-get-dataset-download-url) endpoint.
