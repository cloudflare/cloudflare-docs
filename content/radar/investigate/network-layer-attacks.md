# Network layer attacks

Network layer attacks show [DDoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/layer-3-ddos-attacks/) attack trends at the network layer. These attacks can be split by the network protocol they use: [ICMP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/), [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/), [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) and others.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Unlike what happens in [Application Layer Attacks](/radar/investigate/application-layer-attacks/), in network layer attacks location attribution does not use the location associated with the client's IP address. Instead, it uses the location of the data center itself. This is due to [IP spoofing](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/ip-spoofing/).
{{</Aside>}}

When filtering by location or autonomous system (AS), we are filtering by the source location/AS of the attack
 — which can be very different to the location of the human orchestrator of the attack. Refer to [botnets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-botnet/) for more information.

## List of endpoints

### Timeseries

#### Example: hourly percentage breakdown by attack method

In the following example, we will examine the worldwide versus Singapore distribution of mitigated attacks by network protocol:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/radar/attacks/layer3/timeseries_groups?name=global&dateRange=1d&location=&name=singapore&location=SG&dateRange=1d&aggInterval=1h&format=json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

If we inspect the abbreviated response below, we can conclude that globally, at those timestamps, `UDP` and `TCP` attacks were mostly evenly split.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "result": {
    "global": {
      "timestamps": ["2022-11-06T13:00:00Z", "2022-11-06T14:00:00Z", "..."],
      "udp": ["50.784034", "51.055221", "..."],
      "tcp": ["49.213944", "48.943769", "..."],
      "icmp": ["0.002023", "0.001009", "..."],
      "gre": ["0.0", "0.0", "0.0", "..."]
    },
    "singapore": {
      "timestamps": ["2022-11-06T13:00:00Z", "2022-11-06T14:00:00Z", "..."],
      "tcp": ["79.605287", "83.943885", "..."],
      "udp": ["20.394594", "16.056115", "..."],
      "icmp": ["0.000119", "0.0", "..."],
      "gre": ["0.0", "0.0", "..."]
    },
    "meta": {
      "dateRange": {
        "startTime": "2022-11-06T13:00:00Z",
        "endTime": "2022-11-07T13:00:00Z"
      },
      "normalization": "PERCENTAGE",
    }
  }
}
```

We can also conclude that the distribution of network layer attacks coming from Singapore  — or, more accurately, reaching Cloudflare's data center located in Singapore — differs quite a bit from the worldwide distribution. At those times, the distribution of network layer attacks clearly favors [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/).

For more information refer to the [API reference](/api/operations/radar-get-attacks-layer3-timeseries-by-bytes) for this endpoint.

### Summary

#### Example: Russia - overall percentage breakdown by network protocol

We can also filter by source location and examine attacks coming from Russia:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/radar/attacks/layer3/summary?location=RU&name=attacks_ru&dateRange=1d&format=json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "result": {
    "attacks_ru": {
      "udp": "86.682356",
      "tcp": "11.928664",
      "gre": "1.381015",
      "icmp": "0.007965"
    },
    "meta": {
      "dateRange": {
        "startTime": "2022-11-06T15:00:00Z",
        "endTime": "2022-11-07T15:00:00Z"
      },
      "normalization": "PERCENTAGE"
    }
  }
}
```

The response shows that the attacks coming from Russia to other locations tended to use the [UDP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) network protocol at those timestamps.
