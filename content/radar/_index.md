# {{<beta>}}Cloudflare Radar{{</beta>}}

{{<description>}}
[Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com) is a hub that showcases global Internet traffic, attacks, and technology trends and insights. It is powered by data from Cloudflare’s global network, as well as aggregated and anonymized data from Cloudflare’s [1.1.1.1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/) public DNS Resolver.

Using Radar's API you can now access Cloudflare's data on global Internet traffic as well.
