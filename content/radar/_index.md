[Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com) is a hub that showcases global Internet traffic, attacks, and technology trends and insights. It is powered by data from Cloudflare’s global network, as well as aggregated and [anonymized](/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/) data from Cloudflare’s [1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver](/1.1.1.1/).

Using Radar's API you can access Cloudflare's data on global Internet traffic.

Radar's API is free, allowing academics, data sleuths and other web enthusiasts to investigate Internet usage across the globe.

Data available via Radar API endpoints is made available under the [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license.
