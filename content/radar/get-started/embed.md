# Share a Radar chart

Radar allows you to download an image of a chart, as well as embed interactive cards of most charts into your own web pages.

Charts supporting this feature will have a share icon <img src="/icons/share.svg" style="display: inline-block" title="Share Icon"/> next to its description.


## Download a chart in PNG format

1. Select the Share icon next to the description of the chart you wish to share.
2. Select `Download Image.`
3. A .png file containing the requested chart will be downloaded.


## Embed an interactive chart in your website

1. Press the share button to open the sharing menu

2. Select between **fixed-time** and **real-time**, where:
   - Real-time uses a “sliding window” based on the selected date range, and will display data points looking back over that duration from the current date/time.
   - Fixed-time will always display a chart with only the currently visible data points.

3. Copy the HTML to your page

**Note**: Your current selections, such as date range, location, autonomous system (ASN), and visible series, will be reflected in the shared chart.
