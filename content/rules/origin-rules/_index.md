# Origin Rules (beta)

Origin Rules allow you to customize where the incoming traffic will go and with which parameters. Currently you can perform the following overrides:

* [Host header override](/rules/origin-rules/features/#host-header-override): Overrides the `Host` header of incoming requests.
* [Resolve override](/rules/origin-rules/features/#resolve-override): Overrides the resolved hostname of incoming requests.
* [Destination port override](/rules/origin-rules/features/#destination-port-override): Overrides the resolved destination port of incoming requests.
* [SNI override](/rules/origin-rules/features/#sni-override): Overrides the Server Name Indication (SNI) value of incoming requests.

The Origin Rule expression will determine when these overrides are applied.

Currently you can only create Origin Rules [using the API](/rules/origin-rules/create-api/).

## Important remarks

If you override the hostname with an Origin Rule (via Host header override or resolve override) and add a header override to your load balancer configuration, the Origin Rule will take precedence over the load balancer configuration.
