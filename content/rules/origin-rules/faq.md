# FAQ

Below you will find answers to the most commonly asked questions regarding Origin Rules.

## What happens if I use both an Origin Rule and a Page Rule to perform a Host header/DNS record override?

In this situation the Origin Rule parameters will override the [Page Rule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427) parameters. Consider the following example scenarios:

* A Page Rule defines a Host header override, but not a resolve override (or DNS record override). An Origin Rule defines a DNS record override, but not a Host header override. The resulting request will have the `Host` header defined by the Page Rule and the origin hostname defined by the Origin Rule.
* A Page Rule defines a Host header override, and an Origin Rule also defines a Host header override. The resulting request will have the `Host` header defined by the Origin Rule.

## Will Cloudflare automatically migrate my Page Rules with Host header and DNS record overrides to Origin Rules?

No. This is currently a manual process, since your Page Rules may include additional settings that Origin Rules do not currently support.
