# Create a redirect rule in the dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Rules** > **Redirect Rules**.
3. To create a new empty redirect rule, select **Create rule**. To duplicate an existing rule, select three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.
5. Under **When incoming requests match**, define the [rule expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).
6. Under **Then**, define the [URL redirect settings](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/settings/) for requests matching the rule expression.
7. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.
