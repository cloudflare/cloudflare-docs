# Single Redirects

Single Redirects allow you to create static or dynamic URL {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="redirect">}}redirects{{</glossary-tooltip>}}. Dynamic URL redirects support advanced features such as string replacement operations and [regular expressions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#string-values-and-regular-expressions) (depending on your Cloudflare plan).
