Single Redirects allow you to create static or dynamic URL redirects [^1]. Dynamic URL redirects support advanced features such as string replacement operations and regular expressions (depending on your Cloudflare plan).

[^1]: URL redirects navigate the user from a source URL to a target URL using a given HTTP status code. URL redirection is also known as URL forwarding.

Refer to [Availability](/rules/url-forwarding/#availability) for more information on the quotas and features per Cloudflare plan.
