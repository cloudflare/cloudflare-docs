# Bulk Redirects API JSON objects

## Bulk Redirect Rule

A fully populated Bulk Redirect Rule object has the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "action": "redirect",
  "expression": "http.request.full_uri in $<LIST_NAME>",
  "action_parameters": {
    "from_list": {
      "name": "<LIST_NAME>",
      "key": "http.request.full_uri"
    }
  }
}
```

The JSON object properties must comply with the following:

- `action` must be `redirect`

- `action_parameters` must contain a `from_list` object with additional settings.

- `from_list` must contain the following properties:

  - `name`: The name of an existing Bulk Redirect List to associate with the current Bulk Redirect Rule.
  - `key`: An expression that defines the value that will be matched against the configured URL redirectâ€™s source URL values, following the rules of the [URL matching algorithm](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/how-it-works/#url-matching-algorithm). Refer to [Concepts](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/concepts/#bulk-redirect-rules) for more information.

- `expression` must reference the request field used in the `key` property. Refer to [Concepts](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/concepts/#bulk-redirect-rules) for more information.

## URL redirect list item

A fully populated URL redirect list item object has the following JSON structure:

```json
{

  "redirect": {
    "source_url": "https://example.com/blog",
