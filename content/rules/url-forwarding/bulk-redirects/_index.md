# Bulk Redirects

Bulk Redirects allow you to define a large number of URL redirects at the account level. These redirects navigate the user from a source URL to a target URL using a given HTTP status code. URL redirection is also known as URL forwarding.

Unlike dynamic URL redirects created in [Single Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/single-redirects/), Bulk Redirects are essentially static â€” they do not support string replacement operations or regular expressions. However, you can configure URL redirect parameters that affect their URL matching behavior and their runtime behavior.
