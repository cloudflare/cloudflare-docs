# Bulk Redirects (beta)

Bulk Redirects allow you to define a large number of URL redirects at the account level. These redirects navigate the user from a source URL to a target URL using a given HTTP status code. URL redirection is also known as URL forwarding.

Unlike [Dynamic Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/dynamic-redirects/), Bulk Redirects are essentially static — they do not support any string replacement operations or regular expressions. However, you can configure URL redirect parameters that affect their URL matching behavior and their runtime behavior.
