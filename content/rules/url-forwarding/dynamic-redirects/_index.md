Dynamic Redirects allow you to create powerful URL redirects [^1], such as redirects based on the source country of requests. Unlike [Bulk Redirects](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/), Dynamic Redirects support string replacement operations.

[^1]: URL redirects navigate the user from a source URL to a target URL using a given HTTP status code. URL redirection is also known as URL forwarding.
