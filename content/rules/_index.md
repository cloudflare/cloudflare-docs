# Cloudflare Rules

Cloudflare Rules allows you to perform adjustments to the URI and HTTP headers of requests and responses, and trigger certain actions when a request matches a URL pattern.

## Main features

* **Transform Rules**: Adjust the URI path, query string, and HTTP headers of requests and responses at the edge.

* **URL normalization**: Modify the URLs of incoming requests so that they conform to a consistent formatting standard.

* **Page Rules**: Trigger certain actions when a request matches a URL pattern. For more information, refer to [Understanding and configuring Cloudflare Page Rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/218411427).
