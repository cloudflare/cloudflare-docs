1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and website.

2.  Go to **Rules** > **Transform Rules**.

6.  For **Modify response header**, select one of the following options:

    *   *Set static* — Sets the value of an HTTP response header to a static string value. Overrides the value of an existing header with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
    *   *Set dynamic* — Sets the value of an HTTP response header according to the provided expression. Overrides the value of an existing header with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
    *   *Remove* — Removes the HTTP response header with the provided name, if it exists.

7.  Enter the name of the HTTP response header to modify in **Header name** and the static value or expression in **Value**, if you are setting the header value.

8.  To modify another HTTP response header in the same rule, click **+ Set new header**.

    The following example includes the modification of three response headers using the available actions:

     {{<Aside type="note">}}
You can modify up to 30 HTTP response headers in a single rule.

9.  To save and deploy your rule, click **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, click **Save as Draft**.

After creating a rule, you return to the **Transform Rules** dashboard interface.

If you choose to deploy your HTTP Response Header Modification Rule, the new rule will be enabled. If you save the rule as a draft, the new rule will be disabled.
