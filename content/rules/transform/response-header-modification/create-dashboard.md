# Create an HTTP Response Header Modification Rule in the dashboard

Create HTTP Response Header Modification Rules in the **Modify Response Header** tab of the **Transform Rules** page. Refer to [Response header modification examples](/rules/transform/response-header-modification/examples/) for examples of rule definitions.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and website.

2. Go to **Rules** > **Transform Rules**.

3. Go to the **Modify Response Header** tab.

4. Select **Create rule**.

5. In the rule creation page, enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

6. Under **When incoming requests match**, select if you wish to apply the rule to all incoming requests or only to requests that match a custom filter expression.

7. (Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit rule expressions](/firewall/cf-dashboard/edit-expressions/).

8. For **Modify response header**, select one of the following operations:

    - _Set static_ — Sets the value of an HTTP response header to a static string value. Overrides the value of any existing headers with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
    - _Set dynamic_ — Sets the value of an HTTP response header according to the provided expression. Overrides the value of any existing headers with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
    - _Add_ — Adds an HTTP response header with a static string value. This operation will not remove any existing response headers with the same name.
    - _Remove_ — Removes the HTTP response header with the provided name, if it exists.

9. Enter the name of the HTTP response header to modify in **Header name** and the static value or expression in **Value**, if you are setting the header value.

10. To modify another HTTP response header in the same rule, select **Set new header**. You can modify up to 30 HTTP response headers in a single rule.

    The following example includes the modification of three response headers:

11. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

If you choose to deploy your HTTP Response Header Modification Rule, the new rule will be enabled. If you save the rule as a draft, the new rule will be disabled.
