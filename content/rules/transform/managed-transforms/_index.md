# Managed Transforms

Managed Transforms allow you to perform common adjustments to HTTP request and response headers with the click of a button. 

When you enable a Managed Transform, Cloudflare internally deploys one or more Transform Rules to handle the common configuration you selected. 

For dashboard and API instructions, refer to [Enable a Managed Transform](/rules/transform/managed-transforms/enable/).

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The generated internal Transform Rules will not appear in the Transform Rules list in the Cloudflare dashboard.
