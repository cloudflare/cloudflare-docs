# Create an HTTP request header modification rule in the dashboard

Refer to the [Rules examples gallery](/rules/transform/examples/?operation=Request+modification) for examples of rule definitions.

To create a rule:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and website.

2. Go to **Rules** > **Transform Rules**.

3. Go to the **Modify Request Header** tab.

4. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule**. To duplicate an existing rule, select the three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.

5. In the rule creation page, enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

6. Under **When incoming requests match**, select if you wish to apply the rule to all incoming requests or only to requests that match a custom filter expression.

7. (Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit expressions in the dashboard](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/edit-expressions/).

8. For **Modify request header**, select one of the following options:

    - _Set static_ — Sets the value of an HTTP request header to a static string value. Overrides the value of an existing header with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
    - _Set dynamic_ — Sets the value of an HTTP request header according to the provided expression. Overrides the value of an existing header with the same name or adds a new header if it does not exist.
    - _Remove_ — Removes the HTTP request header with the provided name, if it exists.

9. Enter the name of the HTTP request header to modify in **Header name** and the static value or expression in **Value**, if you are setting the header value.

10. To modify another HTTP request header in the same rule, select **Set new header**. You can modify up to 30 HTTP request headers in a single rule.

    The following example includes the modification of three headers:

11.  To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.

If you choose to deploy your HTTP request header modification rule, the new rule will be enabled. If you save the rule as a draft, the new rule will be disabled.
