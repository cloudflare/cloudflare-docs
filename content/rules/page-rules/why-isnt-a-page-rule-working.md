# Why isn't a Page Rule working?

The number one reason that a Page Rule isn't working, such as URL forwarding, is that the Page Rule you created is on a record that is not proxied by Cloudflare in your [DNS settings](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

Example: You have a Page Rule that redirects a subdomain (`subdomain.yoursitename.com`) back to your apex domain (`yoursitename.com`). If you do not have that record proxied in your DNS settings for the subdomain record (orange cloud), Cloudflare's proxy is not running over the record and a Page Rule will not work because it is going direct to your server.
