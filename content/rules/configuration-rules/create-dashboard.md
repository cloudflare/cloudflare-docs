(Optional) To define a custom expression, use the Expression Builder (specifying one or more values for **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**) or manually enter an expression using the Expression Editor. For more information, refer to [Edit rule expressions](/firewall/cf-dashboard/edit-expressions/).
