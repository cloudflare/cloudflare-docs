# Bulk Redirects (beta)

Bulk Redirects allow you to define a large number of redirects at the account level. These redirects navigate the user from a source URL to a target URL using a given HTTP status code.

Bulk Redirects are essentially static â€” they do not support any string replacement operations or regular expressions. However, you can configure URL Redirect parameters that affect their URL matching behavior and their runtime behavior.
