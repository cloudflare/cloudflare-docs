# Get started

This section covers best practices for setting up [DNS](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/initial-setup/dns/), [HTTP](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/initial-setup/http/), and [network](/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/initial-setup/network/) filtering policies.

For each type of policy, we recommend the following workflow:

1. Connect the devices and/or networks that you want to apply policies to.
2. Verify that Gateway is successfully proxying traffic from your devices.
3. Set up basic security and compatibility policies (recommended for most use cases).
4. Customize your configuration to the unique needs of your organization.
