# CrowdStrike

{{<render file="posture/_available-for-warp-with-gateway.md">}}

Device posture with CrowdStrike requires the CrowdStrike agent and the Cloudflare WARP client to be deployed on your devices. Our service-to-service posture check identifies devices based on their serial numbers.

## Set up CrowdStrike as a service provider

### 1. Obtain CrowdStrike settings

The following CrowdStrike values are needed to set up the CrowdStrike posture check:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Base URL
- Customer ID

To retrieve those values:

1. Log in to your Falcon Dashboard.
2. Go to **Support and resources** > **API Clients and Keys**.
3. Select **Add new API client** and enter any name for the client.
4. Enable the **Read** API Scope for **Zero Trust Assessment**, **Hosts**, **Detections**, **Event Streams**, and **User Management**.
5. Select **Add**.
6. Copy the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Base URL** to a safe place.
7. Go to **Host setup and management** > **Sensor downloads** and copy your Customer ID.
8. Get an auth token from your CrowdStrike API endpoint:

   ```curl
   curl -X POST "<BASE_URL>/oauth2/token" \
       -H "accept: application/json" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       -d "client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>"
   ```

   This POST request authorizes Cloudflare Zero Trust to [add CrowdStrike as a service provider](#2-add-crowdstrike-as-a-service-provider). For more information, refer to the Crowdstrike [auth token documentation](https://falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com/documentation/93/oauth2-auth-token-apis).

### 2. Add CrowdStrike as a service provider

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client**.
2. Scroll down to **Device posture providers** and select **Add new**.
3. Select **CrowdStrike**.
4. Enter any name for the provider. This name will be used throughout the dashboard to reference this connection.
5. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** you noted down above.
6. Enter your **Rest API URL**.
7. Enter your **Customer ID**.
8. Choose a **polling frequency** for how often Cloudflare Zero Trust should query CrowdStrike for information.
9. Select **Save**.
