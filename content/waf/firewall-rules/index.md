# Firewall rules

Firewall rules allow users to create rules that inspect incoming traffic and block, challenge, log, or allow specific requests.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Cloudflare Firewall Rules is the previous version of WAF's [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/). 
{{</Aside>}}

Even though firewall rules are not based on the [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/), you can use the same [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/) to define firewall rule expressions.

For more information on firewall rules, refer to [Cloudflare Firewall Rules](/firewall/).
