# Deploy Managed Rulesets for a zone in the dashboard

You can enable and configure Managed Rulesets for a zone in **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed Rules**.

![Managed Rules tab of Security > WAF](/waf/static/waf-managed-rules-tab.png)

## Deploy a Managed Ruleset

Under **Deploy Managed Rulesets**, click **Add** on the right of a Managed Ruleset to deploy the Managed Ruleset for the current zone.

When you deploy a Managed Ruleset, the WAF adds an _Execute_ rule, displayed under **WAF**, that deploys the Managed Ruleset.

## Enable or disable a Managed Ruleset

Under **WAF**, click the **Enabled** toggle on the right of a Managed Ruleset to enable or disable it.

## Configure a Managed Ruleset

Configure a Managed Ruleset to:

- Define specific field values for one or more rules (for example, configure a rule with an action different from the action configured by Cloudflare)
- Disable one or more rules

To skip one or more rules or WAF Managed Rulesets, [add a WAF exception](/waf/managed-rulesets/waf-exceptions/).

Some Managed Rulesets may not allow custom configuration, depending on your Cloudflare plan.
