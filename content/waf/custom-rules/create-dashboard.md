# Create a custom rule in the dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Custom rules**.

3. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule**. To duplicate an existing rule, select three dots next to it > **Duplicate**.

4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**.

5. Under **If incoming requests match**, use the **Field** drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for **Field** is compared to the value you specify for **Value** using the operator selected in **Operator**.

6. Under **Then take action**, select the rule action in the **Choose action** dropdown. For example, selecting _Block_ tells Cloudflare to refuse requests that match the conditions you specified.

7. (Optional) If you selected the _Block_ action, you can [configure a custom response](#configure-a-custom-response-for-blocked-requests).

8. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select **Save as Draft**.
