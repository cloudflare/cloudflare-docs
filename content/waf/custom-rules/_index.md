# Custom rules

Custom rules allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests to a zone. You can perform actions like *Block* or *JS Challenge* on incoming requests according to rules you define.

To define sets of custom rules that apply to more than one zone, use [custom rulesets](/waf/custom-rulesets/).

This feature is only available for select customers on an Enterprise plan. Contact your account team to get access.

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/), custom rules have an **expression** and an **action**:

* The **expression** specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on using the [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/).
* The **action** specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule.
