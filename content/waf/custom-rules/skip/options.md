# Available skip options

The available skip options in Custom Rules are the following:

{{<definitions>}}

- **Skip the remaining Custom Rules (current ruleset)**

  - Dashboard option: **All remaining Custom Rules**.
  - API action parameter: `ruleset`.
  - Skips the remaining rules in the current ruleset.

- **Skip phases**

  - Dashboard options: **All Rate Limiting Rules** and **All Managed Rules**.

  - API action parameter: `phases`.

  - Skips the execution of one or more phases. Based on the phases you can skip, this option effectively allows you to skip [Rate Limiting Rules](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) and/or [WAF Managed Rulesets](/waf/managed-rulesets/). When skipping a phase, both the account and zone-level entry point rulesets of the phase will be skipped.

  - The phases you can skip are the following:

    - `http_request_firewall_managed`
    - `http_ratelimit`

  - Refer to [Phases](/ruleset-engine/about#phases) for more information.

- **Skip products**

  - API action parameter: `products`.

  - Skips specific security products that are not based on the Ruleset Engine. The products you can skip are the following:
