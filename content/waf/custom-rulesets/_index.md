# Custom rulesets

Custom rulesets are collections of custom rules that you can deploy at the account level. You can apply a custom ruleset to all incoming traffic of zones on an Enterprise plan or to a subset of incoming requests.

Like [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) at the zone level, custom rulesets allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests. You can perform actions like *Block* or *JS Challenge* on incoming requests according to rules you define.

This feature is only available for customers on an Enterprise plan. Contact your account team to get access.
