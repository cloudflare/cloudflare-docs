# Custom rulesets

Custom rulesets are collections of custom rules that you can deploy at the account level.

Like [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/) at the zone level, custom rulesets allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests. You can apply a custom ruleset to all incoming traffic of your Enterprise domains or to a subset of incoming requests.

Account-level WAF configuration requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.
