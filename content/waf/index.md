## Main features

*   **Custom Rules**: Create your own Custom Firewall Rules to protect your website and your APIs from malicious incoming traffic.
*   **Rate Limiting rules**: Define rate limits for incoming requests matching an expression, and the action to take when those rate limits are reached.
*   **WAF Managed Rulesets**: Enable the pre-configured Managed Rulesets to get immediate protection. These rulesets are regularly updated, offering advanced zero-day vulnerability protections. Adjust the behavior of managed rules, choosing from several possible actions.
*   **Exposed Credential Checks**: Monitor and block use of stolen/exposed credentials for account takeover.
*   **Firewall Analytics**: Identify and investigate security threats using an intuitive interface. Tailor your security configurations based on the activity log.

## Availability

The new Cloudflare WAF announced in March 2021 is available for selected customers on paid plans. The exact features and limits depend on your current plan. Rate limiting is a paid add-on on all plans.
