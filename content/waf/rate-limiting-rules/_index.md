# Rate limiting rules

{{<content-column>}}

Rate limiting rules allow you to define rate limits for requests matching an expression, and the action to perform when those rate limits are reached.

## Rule parameters

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/), rate limiting rules have the following basic parameters:

* An [expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/) that specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on using the [Rules language](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/).
* An [action](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/) that specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule and any additional conditions are met. In the case of rate limiting rules, the action occurs when the rate reaches the specified limit.

Besides these two parameters, rate limiting rules require the following additional parameters:

*   **Characteristics**: The set of parameters that define how Cloudflare tracks the rate for this rule.
*   **Period**: The period of time to consider (in seconds) when evaluating the rate.
*   **Requests per period**: The number of requests over the period of time that will trigger the rate limiting rule.
*   **Duration** (or mitigation timeout): Once the rate is reached, the rate limiting rule blocks further requests for the period of time defined in this field.
*   **Action behavior**: By default, Cloudflare will apply the rule action for the configured duration (or mitigation timeout), regardless of the request rate during this period. Some Enterprise customers can configure the rule to [throttle requests](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-following-behavior) over the maximum rate, allowing incoming requests when the rate is lower than the configured limit.

Refer to [Rate limiting parameters](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/) for more information on mandatory and optional parameters.

Refer to [Determining the rate](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/) to learn how Cloudflare uses the parameters above when determining the rate of incoming requests.

## Important remarks

* Rate limiting rules are evaluated in order, and some actions like _Block_ will stop the evaluation of other rules. For more details on actions and their behavior, refer to the [actions reference](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/).

* Rate limiting rules are not designed to allow a precise number of requests to reach the origin server. In some situations, there may be a delay (up to a few seconds) between detecting a request and updating internal counters. Due to this delay, excess requests could still reach the origin server before Cloudflare enforces a mitigation action (such as blocking or challenging) in our global network.

* Applying rate limiting rules to verified bots might affect Search Engine Optimization (SEO). For more information, refer to [Improve SEO](/fundamentals/get-started/task-guides/improve-seo/).

## Next steps

You can configure rate limiting rules at the zone level and at the account level, depending on your plan and product subscriptions.

To configure rate limiting rules in the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to the following resources:
* [Create rate limiting rules in the dashboard for a zone](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/create-zone-dashboard/)
* [Create rate limiting rules in the dashboard for an account](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/create-account-dashboard/)

You can also configure rate limiting rules using the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/). Refer to [Create rate limiting rules via API](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/create-api/) for more information.
