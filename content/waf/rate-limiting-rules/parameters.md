# Rate limiting parameters

The available Rate Limiting Rule parameters are the following:

{{<definitions>}}

- `expression` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}}

  - Field name in the dashboard: **If incoming requests match** (use the Rule Builder or the Expression Editor).
  - Expression you are matching traffic on.

- `action` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}}

  - Field name in the dashboard: **Choose action**.
  - Action to perform when the request rate specified in the rule is reached.
  - Use one of the following values: `block`, `challenge`, `js_challenge`, `managed_challenge`, or `log`.

- `characteristics` {{<type>}}Array\<String>{{</type>}}

  - Field name in the dashboard: **With the same**.

  - Set of parameters defining how Cloudflare tracks the request rate for the rule.

  - Use one or more of the following characteristics:

    | API value                                     | UI value                  |
    | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
    | `cf.colo.id` (mandatory)                      | N/A (implicitly included) |
    | `cf.unique_visitor_id`                        | _IP with NAT support_     |
    | `ip.src`                                      | _IP_                      |
    | `ip.geoip.country`                            | _Country_                 |
    | `ip.geoip.asnum`                              | _AS Num_                  |
    | `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]`       | _Headers_                 |
    | `http.request.cookies["<cookie_name>"]`       | _Cookie_                  |
    | `http.request.uri.args["<query_param_name>"]` | _Query_                   |

  - You cannot use both `cf.unique_visitor_id` and `ip.src` as characteristics of the same Rate Limiting Rule.

  - If you use `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]`, you must enter the header name in lower case, since Cloudflare normalizes header names at the edge.

  - If you use `http.request.cookies["<cookie_name>"]`, refer to [Recommendations](#recommendations) for additional validations you should implement.

  - You should not use `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]` or `http.request.cookies["<cookie_name>"]` as the only characteristic of a Rate Limiting Rule. Refer to [Recommendations](#recommendations) for details.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Use `cf.unique_visitor_id` to handle situations such as requests under NAT sharing the same IP address. Cloudflare uses a variety of privacy-preserving techniques to identify unique visitors, which may include use of session cookies â€” refer to [Cloudflare Cookies](/fundamentals/get-started/cloudflare-cookies) for details.

{{</Aside>}}

- `period` {{<type>}}Number{{</type>}}

  - Field name in the dashboard: **Period**.
  - The period of time to consider (in seconds) when evaluating the request rate.
  - Use one of the following values: `10`, `60` (one minute), `120` (two minutes), `300` (five minutes), `600` (ten minutes), or `3600` (one hour).

- `requests_per_period` {{<type>}}Number{{</type>}}

  - Field name in the dashboard: **Requests**.
  - The number of requests over the period of time that will trigger the rule.

- `mitigation_timeout` {{<type>}}Number{{</type>}}
  - Field name in the dashboard: **Duration**.
  - Once the request rate is reached, the Rate Limiting Rule blocks further requests for the period of time defined in this field (in seconds).
  - Use one of the following values: `30`, `60` (one minute), `600` (ten minutes), `3600` (one hour), or `86400` (one day).
  - The value must be `0` when action is `challenge`, `js_challenge`, or `managed_challenge`.

## Recommendations

- If you use `http.request.cookies["<cookie_name>"]` as a Rate Limiting Rule characteristic, follow these recommendations:

  - Create a [Custom Rule](/waf/custom-rules/) that blocks requests with more than one value for the cookie.
  - Validate the cookie value at the origin before performing any demanding server operations.

- Do not use `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]` or `http.request.cookies["<cookie_name>"]` as the only characteristic of a Rate Limiting Rule, since in some occasions these characteristics have no value. In this case, the requests would fit in the same [rate limiting counter](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/), which could unexpectedly trigger the rule for many visitors.

  To prevent this situation, Cloudflare recommends that you use a second characteristic in your Rate Limiting Rule that always has a defined value, such as `ip.src` or `ip.geoip.asnum`.
