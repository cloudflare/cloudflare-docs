# Rate limiting parameters

The available rate limiting rule parameters are described in the following sections.

## When incoming requests match

**API field name:** `expression` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}} (rule field)

Defines the criteria for the rate limiting rule to match a request.

## Choose action

**API field name:** `action` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}} (rule field)

Action to perform when the rate specified in the rule is reached. Use one of the following values: `block`, `challenge`, `js_challenge`, `managed_challenge`, or `log`.

## Duration

**API field name:** `mitigation_timeout` {{<type>}}Number{{</type>}}

Once the rate is reached, the rate limiting rule applies the rule action to further requests for the period of time defined in this field (in seconds).

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Enterprise customers can customize the action behavior to [throttle requests](#with-the-following-behavior) above the rate limit instead of applying the rule action for a period of time.
{{</Aside>}}

In the dashboard, select one of the available values, which [vary according to your Cloudflare plan](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/#availability). The available API values are: `10`, `60` (one minute), `120` (two minutes), `300` (five minutes), `600` (10 minutes), `3600` (one hour), or `86400` (one day).

You cannot define a duration when using one of the challenge actions. In this case, when visitors pass a challenge, their corresponding [request counter](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/) is set to zero. When visitors with the same values for the rule characteristics make enough requests to trigger the rate limiting rule again, they will receive a new challenge.

To enable the [throttling behavior](#with-the-following-behavior) via API, set `mitigation_timeout` to `0` (zero).

## Requests

**API field name:** `requests_per_period` {{<type>}}Number{{</type>}}

The number of requests over the period of time that will trigger the rule.

## Period

**API field name:** `period` {{<type>}}Number{{</type>}}

The period of time to consider (in seconds) when evaluating the request rate. The available values [vary according to your Cloudflare plan](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/#availability).

The available API values are: `10`, `60` (one minute), `120` (two minutes), `300` (five minutes), `600` (10 minutes), or `3600` (one hour).

## With the same

**API field name:** `characteristics` {{<type>}}Array&lt;String&gt;{{</type>}}

Set of parameters defining how Cloudflare tracks the request rate for the rule.

Use one or more of the following values:

### Notes

- The available characteristics depend on your Cloudflare plan. Refer to [Availability](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/#availability) for more information.
- You cannot use both _IP with NAT support_ and _IP_ as characteristics of the same rate limiting rule.
- If you use `http.request.headers["<header_name>"]` in an API request, you must enter the header name in lower case, since Cloudflare normalizes header names on the Cloudflare global network.
- If you use _Cookie value of_, refer to [Recommendations](#recommendations) for additional validations you should implement.
- You should not use _Header value of_ or _Cookie value of_ as the only characteristic of a rate limiting rule. Refer to [Recommendations](#recommendations) for details.
- For more information on the `lookup_json_string` and `substring` functions, refer to [Functions](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.
- You should not use the `cf.colo.id` characteristic (data center ID) as a field in rule expressions. Additionally, `cf.colo.id` values may change without warning. For more information about this rate limiting characteristic, refer to [Determining the rate](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/).
- Cloudflare will consider entire `/64` prefixes as the same IPv6 source address for the purpose of tracking the request rate.
* Use _IP with NAT support_ to handle situations such as requests under NAT sharing the same IP address. Cloudflare uses a variety of privacy-preserving techniques to identify unique visitors, which may include use of session cookies â€” refer to [Cloudflare Cookies](/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-cookies/) for details.

## Increment counter when

**API field name:** `counting_expression` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}} (optional)

Only available in the Cloudflare dashboard when you enable [Use custom counting expression](#use-custom-counting-expression).

The criteria used for determining the request rate. By default, the counting expression is the same as the rule expression. This default is also applied when you set this field to an empty string (`""`).

The counting expression does not extend the rule matching expression defined in **If incoming requests match**. Therefore, you may wish to include the matching expression in the counting expression. For example, you might want to perform rate limiting for clients sending more than five requests to `/api/` resulting in a `403` HTTP status code from the origin server. In this case, the matching expression would be `starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/")` and the counting expression would be `http.response.code eq 403 and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api/")`. If the counting expression did not include the matching expression (that is, if you had set the counting expression to `http.response.code eq 403`), any response with a `403` status code on any URL would increase the counter.

### Notes

- The counting expression can include [HTTP response fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#http-response-fields). When there are response fields in the counting expression, the counting will happen after the response is sent.

- In some cases, you cannot include HTTP response fields in the counting expression due to configuration restrictions. Refer to [Configuration restrictions](#configuration-restrictions) for details.

## Also apply rate limiting to cached assets

**API field name:** `requests_to_origin` {{<type>}}Boolean{{</type>}} (optional, with the opposite meaning of the Cloudflare dashboard option)

If you disable this setting (or if you set the `requests_to_origin` API field to `true`), only the requests going to the origin (that is, requests that are not cached) will be considered when determining the request rate.

In some cases, you cannot disable **Also apply rate limiting to cached assets** due to configuration restrictions. Refer to [Configuration restrictions](#configuration-restrictions) for details.

## With response type

**API field name:** `response` > `content_type` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}} (optional)

The content type of the returned custom HTTP response when blocking a request due to rate limiting. Only available when the rule action is _Block_.

The available API values are: `application/json`, `text/html`, `text/xml`, or `text/plain`.

## With response code

**API field name:** `response` > `status_code` {{<type>}}Integer{{</type>}} (optional)

The HTTP status code returned to the visitor when blocking the request due to rate limiting. Only available when the rule action is _Block_.

You must enter a value between `400` and `499`. The default value is `429` (`Too many requests`).

## Response body

**API field name:** `response` > `content` {{<type>}}String{{</type>}} (optional)

The body of the returned custom HTTP response when blocking a request due to rate limiting. Only available when the rule action is _Block_.

The maximum field size is 30 KB.

## With the following behavior

**API field name:** `mitigation_period` {{<type>}}Integer{{</type>}}

{{<Aside type="note">}}
This parameter is only available to Enterprise customers with a paid add-on. The action behavior for all other users is always to perform the configured action during the selected duration.
{{</Aside>}}

Defines the behavior of the action selected in [Choose action](#choose-action):

* **Perform action during the selected duration**: Applies the configured action to all requests received during the selected duration.<br>To configure this behavior via API, set `mitigation_timeout` to a value greater than zero. Refer to [Duration](#duration) for more information.

    ![Chart displaying the action of a rate limiting rule configured to apply its action during the entire mitigation period](/images/waf/rate-limiting-rules/behavior-apply-action-for-duration.png)

* **Throttle requests over the maximum configured rate**: Applies the selected action to incoming requests over the configured limit, allowing other requests.<br>To configure this behavior via API, set `mitigation_timeout` to `0` (zero).

## Configuration restrictions

* If the rule expression includes [IP Lists](/fundamentals/global-configurations/lists/ip-lists/), you must enable the **Also apply rate limiting to cached assets** parameter.

* The rule counting expression, defined in the **Increment counter when** parameter, cannot include both [HTTP response fields](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#http-response-fields) and [IP Lists](/fundamentals/global-configurations/lists/ip-lists/). If you use IP Lists, you must enable the **Also apply rate limiting to cached assets** parameter.

## Recommendations

- If you use _Cookie value of_ as a rate limiting rule characteristic, follow these recommendations:

  - Create a [custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) that blocks requests with more than one value for the cookie.
  - Validate the cookie value at the origin before performing any demanding server operations.

- Do not use _Header value of_ or _Cookie value of_ as the only characteristic of a rate limiting rule, since in some occasions these characteristics have no value. In this case, the requests would fit in the same [rate limiting counter](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/request-rate/), which could unexpectedly trigger the rule for many visitors.

  To prevent this situation, Cloudflare recommends that you use a second characteristic in your rate limiting rule that always has a defined value, such as _IP_ or _AS Num_.
