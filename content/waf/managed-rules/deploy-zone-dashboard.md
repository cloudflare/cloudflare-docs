# Deploy a managed ruleset in the dashboard for a zone

You can deploy and configure managed rulesets for a zone in **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules**.

To deploy a managed ruleset for several Enterprise domains in your account, refer to [Deploy a managed ruleset in the dashboard for an account](/waf/managed-rules/deploy-account-dashboard/).

![Example WAF Managed Rules configuration in the Managed rules tab under Security > WAF. There is a configured rule for executing the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, and there are two managed rulesets available for deployment.](/waf/static/waf-managed-rules-tab.png)

## Deploy a managed ruleset

To deploy a managed ruleset with the default configuration, under **Managed Rulesets** select **Deploy** next to a managed ruleset. This operation will deploy the managed ruleset for the current zone.

To configure a ruleset before deploying it, select **Configure** instead of **Deploy** and define the ruleset configuration. For more information on the available settings, refer to [Configure a managed ruleset](#configure-a-managed-ruleset).

When you deploy a managed ruleset, the WAF adds an _Execute_ rule, displayed in **Managed rules**, that deploys the managed ruleset.

## Enable or disable a managed ruleset

Select the **Enabled** toggle next to a managed ruleset to enable or disable it.

## Configure a managed ruleset

Configure a managed ruleset to:

- Define specific field values for one or more rules (for example, configure a rule with an action different from the action configured by Cloudflare).
- Disable one or more rules.
- Specify a custom filter expression to apply the rules in the ruleset to a subset of incoming requests.

To skip one or more rules, or entire WAF managed rulesets, [add a WAF exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/).

Some managed rulesets may not allow custom configuration, depending on your Cloudflare plan.

### Configure field values for all the rules

To configure rule field values for all the rules in a managed ruleset:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules**.

3. Next to the _Execute_ rule that deploys the managed ruleset you want to configure, select **Edit**.

4. Under **Ruleset configuration**, set one or more rule fields from the available values in the drop-down lists.

    For example, select the action to perform for all the rules in the ruleset from the **Ruleset action** drop-down list.

5. (Optional) To apply the rules in the ruleset to a subset of incoming requests instead of all requests, [set the scope using a custom filter expression](#specify-a-custom-expression-for-the-ruleset).

6. Select **Save**.

### View the rules of a managed ruleset

You can browse the available rules in a managed ruleset and search for individual rules or tags.

Use the available filters in the Browse Managed Ruleset interface.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules**.

3. Next to the _Execute_ rule that deploys the managed ruleset you want to browse, select **Edit**.

### Specify a custom expression for the ruleset

To apply the rules in the ruleset to a subset of incoming requests, specify a custom filter expression for the rule that executes the managed ruleset.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules**.

3. Next to the _Execute_ rule that deploys the managed ruleset, select **Edit**.

4. Select **Edit filter**.

5. Under **Set Scope**, select **Custom filter expression**.

6. Under **When incoming requests match**, define the scope for all the rules in the ruleset using a custom filter expression. Use the Expression Builder or the Expression Editor for defining the expression. For more information, refer to [Edit rule expressions](/firewall/cf-dashboard/edit-expressions/).

7. Select **Next**, and then select **Save**.
