# Add an exception via API

To add a managed rules exception via API, create a rule with `skip` action in a [phase entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) of the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase. You can define exceptions at the account level and at the zone level. Exceptions are also called skip rules.

To configure the exception, define the `action_parameters` object according to the exception type. Refer to the following examples:

- [Skip all remaining rules](#skip-all-remaining-rules)
- [Skip the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](#skip-the-cloudflare-managed-ruleset)
- [Skip one or more rules of WAF managed rulesets](#skip-one-or-more-rules-of-waf-managed-rulesets)

For more information on creating exceptions via API, refer to [Create an exception](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

{{<Aside type="note" header="Rule execution order">}}
Rules with `skip` action only apply to rules with `execute` action listed **after** them. If you add a rule with `skip` action at the end of the rules list, nothing will be skipped.
{{</Aside>}}

## Examples

### Skip all remaining rules

The following example adds a rule that skips all remaining rules in the entry point ruleset for requests matching the `dev.example.com` hostname.

1. Invoke the [Get a zone entry point ruleset](/api/operations/getZoneEntrypointRuleset) operation to obtain the current configuration of the entry point ruleset of the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

    ```bash
    ---
    header: Request
    ---
    curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
    ```

    ```json
    ---
    header: Example response
    highlight: 3
    ---
    {
      "result": {
        "id": "060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c", // entry point ruleset ID
        "name": "default",
        "description": "",
        "source": "firewall_managed",
        "kind": "zone",
        "version": "3",
        "rules": [
          // (...)
        ],
        "last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:29:00.190643Z",
        "phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
      },
      "success": true,
      "errors": [],
      "messages": []
    }
    ```

    Save the entry point ruleset ID ({{<rule-id>}}060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c{{</rule-id>}}) for the next step.

2. Invoke the [Create a zone ruleset rule](/api/operations/createZoneRulesetRule) operation (a `POST` request) to add an exception (or skip rule) at the beginning of the rules list, since a skip rule applies only to rules listed after it. The exact rule location is defined in the [`position` object](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/add-rule/#define-the-rule-position-in-the-ruleset).

    ```bash
    ---
    header: Request
    ---
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{entry_point_ruleset_id}/rules" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "expression": "(http.host eq \"dev.example.com\")",
      "description": "Skip managed rules for dev.example.com",
      "action": "skip",
      "action_parameters": {
        "ruleset": "current"
      },
      "position": {
        "before": ""
      }
    }'
    ```

For more information on skipping all remaining rules via API, refer to [Create an exception](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/#skip-all-remaining-rules) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

### Skip the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset

The following example adds a rule that skips the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) for requests matching the `dev.example.com` hostname.

1. Invoke the [Get a zone entry point ruleset](/api/operations/getZoneEntrypointRuleset) operation to obtain the current configuration of the entry point ruleset of the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase.

    ```bash
    ---
    header: Request
    ---
    curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
    ```

    ```json
    ---
    header: Example response
    highlight: 3,12,20
    ---
    {
      "result": {
        "id": "060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c", // entry point ruleset ID
        "name": "default",
        "description": "",
        "source": "firewall_managed",
        "kind": "zone",
        "version": "3",
        "rules": [
          // (...)
          {
            "id": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7", // `execute` rule ID
            "version": "1",
            "action": "execute",
            "expression": "true",
            "last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:21:28.643979Z",
            "ref": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7",
            "enabled": true,
            "action_parameters": {
              "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee", // "Cloudflare Managed Ruleset" ID
              "version": "latest"
            }
          },
          // (...)
        ],
        "last_updated": "2024-01-20T14:29:00.190643Z",
        "phase": "http_request_firewall_managed"
      },
      "success": true,
      "errors": [],
      "messages": []
    }
    ```

    Identify the rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset by searching for an `execute` rule with `action_parameters` > `id` equal to {{<rule-id>}}efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee{{</rule-id>}} (the managed ruleset ID).

    {{<Aside type="note">}}
To get the IDs of existing WAF managed rulesets, refer to [WAF Managed Rules](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) or use the [List account rulesets](/api/operations/listAccountRulesets) operation.
    {{</Aside>}}

    Save the following IDs for the next step:

    - The ID of the entry point ruleset ({{<rule-id>}}060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c{{</rule-id>}} in this example)
    - The ID of the `execute` rule deployment the managed ruleset ({{<rule-id>}}1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7{{</rule-id>}} in this example)

2. Invoke the [Create a zone ruleset rule](/api/operations/createZoneRulesetRule) operation (a `POST` request) to add an exception (or skip rule) immediately before the `execute` rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, since a skip rule applies only to rules listed after it. The exact rule location is defined in the [`position` object](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/add-rule/#define-the-rule-position-in-the-ruleset).

    ```bash
    ---
    header: Request
    ---
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{entry_point_ruleset_id}/rules" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "expression": "(http.host eq \"dev.example.com\")",
      "description": "Skip the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset for dev.example.com",
      "action": "skip",
      "action_parameters": {
        "rulesets": [
          "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee"
        ]
      },
      "position": {
        "before": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7"
      }
    }'
    ```

For more information on skipping one or more managed rulesets via API, refer to [Create an exception](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/#skip-one-or-more-managed-rulesets) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

### Skip one or more rules of WAF managed rulesets

The following example adds a rule that skips a particular rule of the [Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/) for requests matching the `dev.example.com` hostname.

1. Invoke the [Get a zone ruleset](/api/operations/getZoneRuleset) operation to obtain a list of rules in the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (ruleset ID {{<rule-id>}}efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee{{</rule-id>}}).<br>
    You can get the managed ruleset details using the account-level endpoint ([Get an account ruleset](/api/operations/getAccountRuleset)) or the zone-level endpoint ([Get a zone ruleset](/api/operations/getZoneRuleset)).

    {{<Aside type="note">}}
To get the IDs of existing WAF managed rulesets, refer to [WAF Managed Rules](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) or use the [List account rulesets](/api/operations/listAccountRulesets) operation.

    ```

    Identify the rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset by searching for an `execute` rule with `action_parameters` > `id` equal to {{<rule-id>}}efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee{{</rule-id>}} (the managed ruleset ID).

    {{<Aside type="note">}}
To get the IDs of existing WAF managed rulesets, refer to [WAF Managed Rules](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) or use the [List account rulesets](/api/operations/listAccountRulesets) operation.
    {{</Aside>}}

    Save the following IDs for the next step:

    - The ID of the entry point ruleset ({{<rule-id>}}060013b1eeb14c93b0dcd896537e0d2c{{</rule-id>}} in this example)
    - The ID of the `execute` rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset ({{<rule-id>}}1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7{{</rule-id>}} in this example)

    You will also use the following IDs:

    - The ID of the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset ({{<rule-id>}}efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee{{</rule-id>}})
    - The ID of the rule to skip ({{<rule-id>}}d9e350f1b72d4730899c8a420e48a85d{{</rule-id>}} in this example)

3. Invoke the [Create a zone ruleset rule](/api/operations/createZoneRulesetRule) operation (a `POST` request) to add an exception (or skip rule) immediately before the `execute` rule deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, since a skip rule applies only to rules listed after it.

    ```bash
    ---
    header: Request
    ---
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/{entry_point_ruleset_id}/rules" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \

        "before": "1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7"
      }
    }'
    ```

    The `action_parameters` > `rules` object contains the ID of the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset with an associated list of rule IDs to skip (in this case, only one rule). The [`position` object](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/add-rule/#define-the-rule-position-in-the-ruleset) defines the exact rule placement in the entry point ruleset (before rule {{<rule-id>}}1bdb49371c1f46958fc8b985efcb79e7{{</rule-id>}}).

For more information on skipping one or more rules of managed rulesets via API, refer to [Create an exception](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/create-exception/#skip-one-or-more-rules-of-managed-rulesets) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.
