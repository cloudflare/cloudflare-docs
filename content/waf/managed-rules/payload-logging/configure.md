# Configure payload logging for a managed ruleset in the dashboard

Configure payload logging for a ruleset in the ruleset configuration page.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Only users with the [Super Administrator role](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/members/roles/) can configure payload logging and decrypt payloads in the Cloudflare dashboard. Other users can decrypt payloads if they have access to the logs and to the private key.
{{</Aside>}}

Do the following:

1.  Open **Security** > **WAF** > **Managed rules**.

    ![Example Managed Rules configuration in the Managed rules tab under Security > WAF](/waf/static/waf-managed-rules-tab.png)

2.  To configure payload logging for a ruleset you had already deployed in the WAF, select **Edit** next to the managed ruleset name.

    To deploy a managed ruleset and configure payload logging, select **Configure** next to the managed ruleset under **Managed Rulesets**.

3.  At the bottom of the page, select **Configure payload logging**.

4.  After reading and understanding the implications of enabling payload logging, select one of the available options:

    - **Generate key pair using your web browser** — Generates a key pair (a private and a public key) in your browser and configures payload logging with the generated public key.

    - **Use my own public key** — Enter a public key [generated by the `matched-data-cli` command-line tool](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair/).

5.  Select **Next**.

6.  If you generated a key pair in the browser, copy the displayed private key and **store it safely**. You will use this private key later to [view the decrypted payload content](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/view/).

7.  Select **Done**.

8.  If you are deploying the managed ruleset where you configured payload logging, select **Deploy**. If you configured payload logging for a ruleset you had already deployed, select **Save**.
