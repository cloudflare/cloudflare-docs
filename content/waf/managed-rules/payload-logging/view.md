# View the payload content in the dashboard

View the content of the matched rule payload in the dashboard by entering your private key.

1.  Open **Security** > **Events**.

2.  Under **Activity log**, expand the details of an event triggered by a rule whose managed ruleset has payload logging enabled.

3.  Under **Payload match**, select **Decrypt payload log**.

4.  Enter your private key in the pop-up window and select **Decrypt**.

The private key is not sent to a Cloudflare server. The decryption occurs entirely in the browser.

If the private key you entered decrypts the encrypted payload successfully, the **Payload match** card displays the payload content in clear text.
