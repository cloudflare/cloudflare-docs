# Managed Lists

Cloudflare provides Managed Lists you can use in rule expressions. These lists are regularly updated.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

## Managed IP Lists

Use Managed IP Lists to access Cloudflare's IP threat intelligence.

Cloudflare provides the following Managed IP Lists:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Display name</th>
      <th style="width: 30%">Name in expressions</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloudflare Open Proxies</td>
      <td><code>cf.open_proxies</code></td>
      <td>IP addresses of known open HTTP and SOCKS proxy endpoints, which are frequently used to launch attacks and hide attackers identity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloudflare Anonymizers</td>
      <td><code>cf.anonymizer</code></td>
      <td>IP addresses of known anonymizers (Open SOCKS Proxies, VPNs, and TOR nodes).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloudflare VPNs</td>
      <td><code>cf.vpn</code></td>
      <td>IP addresses of known VPN servers. 
      </td>
    </tbody>
    </table>

{{<Aside>}}
Cloudflare primarily detects VPN traffic that passes through our public resolver at 1.1.1.1 and is not shared with other hostnames. Additionally, we can identify major VPNs based on their published IP addresses. However, we do not block all VPNs at this time. We are continually working to improve our detection capabilities and expand our coverage to include a wider range of VPN services.
