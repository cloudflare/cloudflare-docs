To configure a rule in the Browse Managed Ruleset interface:

1. Search for a rule using the available filters. You can search for tags.

2. Find the rule you want to configure in the results list.

3. In the result line for the rule you want to change, select the desired value for a field in the displayed drop-down lists. For example, select the rule action in the **Action** dropdown.

    In some managed rulesets, you can also change the status of a rule using the toggle next to the rule.
