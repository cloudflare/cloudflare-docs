WAF Managed Rules allow you to deploy pre-configured managed rulesets that provide immediate protection against:

* Zero-day vulnerabilities
* Top-10 attack techniques
* Use of stolen/exposed credentials
* Extraction of sensitive data

These managed rulesets are regularly updated. Each rule has a default action that varies according to the severity of the rule. You can adjust the behavior of specific rules, choosing from several possible actions.

Rules of managed rulesets have associated tags (such as `wordpress`) that allow you to search for a specific group of rules and configure them in bulk.
