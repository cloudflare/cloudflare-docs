WAF Managed Rules allow you to deploy pre-configured managed rulesets that provide immediate protection against:

* Zero-day vulnerabilities
* Top-10 attack techniques
* Use of stolen/exposed credentials
* Extraction of sensitive data

These managed rulesets are regularly updated. You can adjust the behavior of specific rules in these rulesets, choosing from several possible actions.
