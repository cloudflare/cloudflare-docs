### Export activity log data

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Only available on Business and Enterprise plans.

{{</Aside>}}

You can export a set of up to 500 raw events from the **Activity log** in JSON format. Export event data to combine and analyze Cloudflare data with your own stored in a separate system or database, such as a security information and event management system (SIEM). The data you export will reflect any filters you have applied.

To export the displayed events (up to 500), select **Export** in the **Activity log**.
