## Main features

*   **Custom rules**: Create your own custom rules to protect your website and your APIs from malicious incoming traffic.
*   **Rate limiting rules**: Define rate limits for incoming requests matching an expression, and the action to take when those rate limits are reached.
*   **WAF Managed Rulesets**: Enable the pre-configured Managed Rulesets to get immediate protection. These rulesets are regularly updated, offering advanced zero-day vulnerability protections. Adjust the behavior of managed rules, choosing from several possible actions.
*   **Exposed Credential Checks**: Monitor and block use of stolen/exposed credentials for account takeover.
*   **Firewall Analytics**: Identify and investigate security threats using an intuitive interface. Tailor your security configurations based on the activity log.
