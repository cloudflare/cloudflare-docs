# Troubleshoot and debug

Troubleshoot and debug errors commonly associated with connecting to a database with Hyperdrive.

## Connection errors

When creating a new Hyperdrive configuration, or updating the connection parameters associated with an existing configuration, Hyperdrive performs a test connection to your database in the background before creating or updating the configuration.

Hyperdrive will also issue an empty test query, a `;` in PostgreSQL, to validate that it can pass queries to your database.

| Error Code    | Details                    | Recommended fixes                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `2008`          | Bad hostname.              | Hyperdrive could not resolve the database hostname. Confirm it exists in public DNS. |
| `2009`          | The hostname does not resolve to a public IP address, or the IP address is not a public address. | Hyperdrive can only connect to public IP addresses. Private IP addresses, like `10.1.5.0` or `192.168.2.1`, are not currently supported. |
| `2010`          | Cannot connect to the host:port.         | Hyperdrive could not route to the hostname: ensure it has a public DNS record that resolves to a public IP address. Check that the hostname is not misspelled. |
| `2011`          | Connection refused.                      | A network firewall or access control list (ACL) is likely rejecting requests from Hyperdrive. Ensure you have allowed connections from the public Internet. |
| `2012`          | TLS (SSL) not supported by the database. | Hyperdrive requires TLS (SSL) to connect. Configure TLS on your database. |
| `2013`          | Invalid database credentials. | Ensure your username is correct (and exists), and the password is correct (case-sensitive). |
| `2014`          | The specified database name does not exist. | Check that the database (not table) name you provided exists on the database you are asking Hyperdrive to connect to. |
| `2015`          | Generic error.     | Hyperdrive failed to connect and could not determine a reason. Open a support ticket so Cloudflare can investigate.|
| `2016`          | Test query failed. | Confirm that the user Hyperdrive is connecting as has permissions to issue read and write queries to the given database. |
