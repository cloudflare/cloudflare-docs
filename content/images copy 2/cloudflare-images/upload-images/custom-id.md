# Custom ID

You can use a custom path to upload images to Cloudflare Images, instead of the path automatically generated by Cloudflare Images’ Universal Unique Identifier (UUID). The custom path has the following properties:

- Can be up to 1024 characters long.
- Can include any number of subpaths.
- Supports the [UTF-8 encoding standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) for characters.

Below is an example of the custom ID feature using upload via URL:

```bash
curl --request POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<​​ACCOUNT_ID>/images/v1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'url=https://<REMOTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>' \
  --form 'id=<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>'
```

You can also use the custom ID feature with direct file upload:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/images/v1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'file=@./<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>' \
  --form 'id=<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>'
```

You will then receive a response similar to this: 

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>",
    "filename": "<YOUR_IMAGE>",
    "uploaded": "2022-04-20T09:51:09.559Z",
    "requireSignedURLs": false,
    "variants": ["https://imagedelivery.net/Vi7wi5KSItxGFsWRG2Us6Q/<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>/public"]
  },
  "result_info": null,
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

You can use the custom ID feature with the ability to [serve images from custom domains](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/serve-images-custom-domains/) for added flexibility.

Refer to [Make your first API request](/images/cloudflare-images/api-request/) to learn more about API tokens.

## Custom IDs in delivery URLs

When [serving images](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images), you can include non URL-encoded Custom IDs directly in the image URLs. However, any `%` characters present in Custom IDs must be encoded to `%25` in the image delivery URLs.

## Custom IDs and private images

Images with a [custom ID](/images/cloudflare-images/upload-images/custom-id/) cannot be made private using [signed URL tokens](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/serve-private-images-using-signed-url-tokens/).
