# Cloudflare Network Interconnect

Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI) allows you to connect your network infrastructure directly with Cloudflare – rather than using the public Internet – for a more reliable and secure experience.

Cloudflare partners with multiple network fabric providers to offer as many connectivity options and locations as possible.
