# Enable Load Balancing

If you want to enable load balancing as an add-on for your account, the process depends on your plan type.

Accounts with at least one **Enterprise** plan should contact their account team.

All other accounts should enable Load Balancing in the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Choose your account and website.
3. Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.
4. Click **Enable Load Balancing**.
5. Choose your plan options and confirm payment.
