You can create a pool within the [load balancer workflow](/load-balancing/how-to/create-load-balancer/) or in the **Origin Pools** section of the dashboard:

1.  Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.

2.  Click **Manage Pools**.

3.  Click **Create**.

4.  For your pool, enter the following information:
    *   A name (must be unique)
    *   A description to provide more detail on the name
    *   A choice for [**Origin Steering**](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/), which affects how your pool routes traffic to each origin

5.  For each origin, enter the following information:
    *   A name (must be unique)
    *   The origin server address or associated hostname
    *   A [**Weight**](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/#weights)
    *   (Optional) A [hostname](/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/) by clicking **Add host header**

6.  Repeat this process for additional origins in the pool.

7.  (Optional) Set up coordinates for [Proximity Steering](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/proximity-steering/) on the pool.

8.  On the origin pool, update the following information:
    *   **Health Threshold**: {{<render file=_pool-health-threshold.md productFolder="load-balancing">}}
    *   **Monitor**: Attach a [monitor](/load-balancing/how-to/create-monitor/)
    *   **Health Check Regions**: Choose whether to check pool health from [multiple locations](/load-balancing/understand-basics/monitors/#health-check-regions), which increases accuracy but can lead to probe traffic to your origin
    *   **Pool Notifications**: You can set up new alerts - and view existing alerts - to be notified when pools are enabled or disabled, or pools or origins have changes in their [health status](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/).

9.  When finished, click **Save**.
