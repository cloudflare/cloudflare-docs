You can create a monitor within the [load balancer workflow](/load-balancing/how-to/create-load-balancer/) or in the **Monitors** section of the dashboard:

1.  Go to **Traffic** > **Load Balancing**.

2.  Click **Manage Monitors**.

3.  Click **Create**.

4.  Add the following information:
    *   **Type**: The protocol to use for health checks
        *   *Non-enterprise customers*: Choose **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, or **TCP**.
        *   *Enterprise customers*: Choose **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, **TCP**, **UDP ICMP**, **ICMP Ping**, or **SMTP**.
    *   **Path**: The endpoint path to run health checks against
    *   **Port**: The destination port for health checks

5.  For additional settings, select **Advanced health check settings**:

    *   **Interval**:
        *   By increasing the default, you can improve failover time, but you may also increase load on your servers.
        *   Minimum time in seconds is 60 (Pro), 10 (Business), and 5 (Enterprise).
    *   **Timeout** and **Retries**:
        *   The health check will return unhealthy if it exceeds the duration specified in **Timeout** (and exceeds this duration more times than the specified number of **Retries**).
    *   **Expected Code(s)**: The expected HTTP response codes listed individually (200, 302) or as a range (2xx, 3xx).
    *   **Response Body**:
        *   Looks for a case-insensitive substring in the response body.
        *   Make sure that the value is relatively static and within the first 100,000 KB of the HTML page.
    *   **Simulate Zone**:
        *   Pushes a request from Cloudflare Health Monitors through the Cloudflare stack as if it were a real visitor request to help analyze behavior or validate a configuration.
        *   Ensures health checks are compatible with features like [authenticated origin pulls](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/) and [Argo Smart Routing](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115000224552).
    *   **Follow Redirects**:
        *   Instead of reporting a `301` or `302` code as unhealthy, the health check follows redirects to the final endpoint.
    *   **Configure Request Header(s)**:
        *   Useful if your servers are expecting specific incoming headers.

6.  Select **Save**.

To increase confidence in pool status, increase the `consecutive_up` and `consecutive_down` fields when [creating a monitor with the API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#account-load-balancer-monitors-create-monitor). To become healthy or unhealthy, monitored origins must pass this health check the consecutive number of times specified in these parameters.
