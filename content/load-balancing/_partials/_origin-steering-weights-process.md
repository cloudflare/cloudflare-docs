To customize weights when you [create or edit a pool](/load-balancing/how-to/create-pool/), set the **Weight** to a number between 0 and 1 (expressed in increments of .01). Cloudflare will then send traffic to that pool based on a combination of your origin steering policy and the following formula.

```txt
% of traffic to origin = origin weight ÷ sum of all weights in the pool
```

<div>

Here’s an example applying weights to three origin servers with a **Random** origin steering policy:

- **Weights:** Origin Server A = 0.25; Origin Server B = 0.25; Origin Server C = 0.50
- **When all origins are healthy**, each origin will receive the following proportion of total traffic: A = 25%; B = 25%; C = 50%.
- **When one origin is unhealthy** (such as origin C), each healthy origin will receive the following proportion of total traffic: A = 50%; B=50%.

A significant amount of traffic is required for the distribution to converge on the expected values.

An origin with a weight of **0** should not receive any traffic sent to that pool (though the origin will still receive health checks).

You can also see this value in the **Percent** field when creating or editing a pool in the dashboard.

If an origin is used in multiple pools and has multiple weights assigned, the total traffic sent to that pool will differ from the percentage specified in each individual pool.
