A monitor issues health checks at regular intervals to evaluate the health of each server within an [origin pool](/load-balancing/understand-basics/pools/).

When a pool [becomes unhealthy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/), your load balancer takes that pool out of the server rotation.
