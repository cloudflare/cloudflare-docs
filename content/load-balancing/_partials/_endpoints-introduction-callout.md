Since load balancing targets are not limited to origin web servers, the term `endpoints` has been introduced. Refer to [Service-Specific Terms](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-other-terms/) for its use in the context of Cloudflare offerings, and to [load balancing concepts](/load-balancing/understand-basics/load-balancing-components/) or [Reference Architecture](/reference-architecture/architectures/load-balancing/) for use case examples.

On the [Load Balancing API](/api/operations/load-balancers-load-balancer-details), `origin` has been maintained.
