A load balancer distributes traffic among origin pools according to [pool health](/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/) and its [steering policy](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/pool-level-steering/). Each load balancer is identified by its DNS hostname (`lb.example.com`, `www.example.com`, etc.).
