To increase confidence in pool status, you can also increase the `consecutive_up` and `consecutive_down` fields when [creating a monitor with the API](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-monitors-create-monitor). 

To become healthy or unhealthy, monitored origins must pass this health check the consecutive number of times specified in these parameters.
