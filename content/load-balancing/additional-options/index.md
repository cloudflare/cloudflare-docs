# Additional configuration

Beyond [creating a simple load balancer](/get-started), you may want to further customize how your load balancer routes traffic or integrate your load balancer with other Cloudflare products.

## Customize load balancer behavior

- Route traffic according to characteristics of each request by [creating custom rules](load-balancing-rules)
- Protect at-risk origins from reaching failover by [setting up load shedding](load-shedding)
- Take servers out of rotation for [planned maintenance](planned-maintenance)

## Integrate with other Cloudflare products

- Bring load balancing to your TCP or UDP applications with [Cloudflare Spectrum](spectrum)
- Further secure origin access with [Cloudflare Tunnel](cloudflare-tunnel)
- Accelerate dynamic content with [Cloudflare Railgun](railgun)

## Integrate with 3rd parties

- [Deploy containerized applications](deploy-containerized-applications) across multiple clouds
- Increase visibility by [sending health check notifications to Pagerduty](pagerduty-integration)
