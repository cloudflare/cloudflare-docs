# Override HTTP Host headers

When your application needs specialized routing (`CNAME` setup or custom hosts like Heroku), you can customize the `Host` header used in health checks on a per-origin or per-monitor level.

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Important">}}

If you set a header override on an individual origin, it will take precedence over a header override set on a monitor.

Also, if you configure an [Origin Rule](/rules/origin-rules/) that overrides the hostname and set up a header override in your Load Balancer configuration, the Origin Rule will take precedence over the Load Balancer configuration.

## Per origin Host header override

To balance traffic across multiple hosts, add `Host` headers to individual origins within the same pool.

For example, you might have a pool with origins hosted in multiple AppEngine projects or Amazon S3 buckets. You also might want to set up specific failover origins within a pool.

Since these examples require specific hostnames per origin, your load balancer will not properly route traffic _without_ a `Host` header override.

If you need an origin `Host` header override, add it when [creating](/load-balancing/how-to/create-pool/) or editing a pool. For security reasons, this header must meet one of the following criteria:

- Is a subdomain of a zone associated with this account
- Matches the origin address
- Publicly resolves to the origin address

## Host header prioritization

If you set a header override on an individual origin, it will take precedence over a header override set on a monitor during health checks.

For example, you might have a load balancer for `www.example.com` with the following setup:

- Origin Pools:

  - Pool 1:

    - Origin 1 (`Host` header set to `lb-app-a.example.com`)
    - Origin 2

  - Pool 2:

    - Origin 3
    - Origin 4 (`Host` header set to `lb-app-b.example.com`)

- Monitor (`Host` header set to `www.example.com`)

In this scenario, health checks for **Origin 1** would use `lb-app-a.example.com`, health checks for **Origin 4** would use `lb-app-b.example.com`, and all other health checks would default to `www.example.com`.

For a list of origins that override a monitor's `Host` header:

1.  On a monitor, select **Edit**.
2.  Select **Advanced health check settings**.
3.  If you have origin overrides, you will see **Origin host header overrides**.
