# Add load balancing to Spectrum applications

You can configure a load balancer to provide TCP healthchecks, failover, and traffic steering to bring resiliency to your Spectrum applications.

For more details, refer to [Create a Spectrum application using a Load Balancer](/spectrum/get-started/#create-a-spectrum-application-using-a-load-balancer).
