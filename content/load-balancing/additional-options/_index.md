# Additional configuration

Beyond [creating a simple load balancer](/load-balancing/how-to/create-load-balancer/), you may want to further customize how your load balancer routes traffic or integrate your load balancer with other Cloudflare products.

## Customize load balancer behavior

*   Route traffic according to characteristics of each request by [creating custom rules](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/)
*   Protect at-risk origins from reaching failover by [setting up load shedding](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-shedding/)
*   Take servers out of rotation for [planned maintenance](/load-balancing/additional-options/planned-maintenance/)

## Integrate with other Cloudflare products

*   Bring load balancing to your TCP or UDP applications with [Cloudflare Spectrum](/load-balancing/additional-options/spectrum/)
*   Further secure origin access with [Cloudflare Tunnel](/load-balancing/additional-options/cloudflare-tunnel/)

## Integrate with 3rd parties

*   [Deploy containerized applications](/load-balancing/additional-options/deploy-containerized-applications/) across multiple clouds
*   Increase visibility by [sending health monitor notifications to Pagerduty](/load-balancing/additional-options/pagerduty-integration/)
