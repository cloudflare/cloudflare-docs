# Additional configuration

Beyond [creating a simple load balancer](/load-balancing/get-started/), you may want to further customize how your load balancer routes traffic or integrate your load balancer with other Cloudflare products.

## Customize load balancer behavior

*   Route traffic according to characteristics of each request by [creating custom rules](/load-balancing/load-balancing-rules/)
*   Protect at-risk origins from reaching failover by [setting up load shedding](/load-balancing/load-shedding/)
*   Take servers out of rotation for [planned maintenance](/load-balancing/planned-maintenance/)

## Integrate with other Cloudflare products

*   Bring load balancing to your TCP or UDP applications with [Cloudflare Spectrum](/load-balancing/spectrum/)
*   Further secure origin access with [Cloudflare Tunnel](/load-balancing/cloudflare-tunnel/)
*   Accelerate dynamic content with [Cloudflare Railgun](/load-balancing/railgun/)

## Integrate with 3rd parties

*   [Deploy containerized applications](/load-balancing/deploy-containerized-applications/) across multiple clouds
*   Increase visibility by [sending health check notifications to Pagerduty](/load-balancing/pagerduty-integration/)
