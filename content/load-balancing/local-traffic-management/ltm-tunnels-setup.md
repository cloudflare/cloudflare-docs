# Set up private IPs with Cloudflare Tunnel

Consider the following steps to learn how to configure Cloudflare local traffic management (LTM) solution, using [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) as the off-ramp to securely connect to your private or internal services.

## 1. Configure a Cloudflare tunnel with an assigned virtual network

The specific configuration steps can vary depending on your infrastructure and services you are looking to connect. If you are not familiar with Cloudflare Tunnel, the pages linked on each step provide more guidance.

1. [Create a tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/#1-create-a-tunnel).
2. [Deploy the tunnel](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/deploy-tunnels/) to connect to your data center.
3. Create a [virtual network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/) and assign it to the tunnel you configured in the previous steps.

{{<tab label="dashboard" no-code="true">}}

To create a virtual network:

1. Within the [Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **WARP Client** and find the **Virtual networks** setting.
2. Select **Add new** or **Manage** > **Create virtual network** to create virtual networks.
3. Define your virtual network name and select **Save**.

To assign the virtual network to the tunnel:

1. Go to **Networks** > **Tunnels**.
2. Select the tunnel you created in the previous steps and select **Configure**.
3. Under **Private Network**, select **Add a private network**.
4. Specify an IP range under **CIDR** and select the virtual network under **Additional settings**.
5. Select **Save private network**.

{{<tab label="cli" no-code="true">}}

To create a virtual network:

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel vnet add <VNET_NAME>
```

To assign the virtual network to the tunnel:

```sh
$ cloudflared tunnel route ip add --vnet <VNET_NAME> <IP_RANGE> <TUNNEL_NAME>
```

## 2. Configure Cloudflare Load Balancing

Once you have Cloudflare tunnels with associated virtual networks (VNets) configured, the VNets can be specified for each endpoint when you [create or edit a pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/#create-a-pool). This will enable Cloudflare load balancers to use the correct tunnel and securely reach the private IP endpoints.

The specific configuration will vary depending on your use case. Refer to the following steps to understand the workflow.

1. [Create the Load Balancing monitor](/load-balancing/monitors/create-monitor/) according to your needs.
2. [Create the pool](/load-balancing/pools/create-pool/) specifying your private IP addresses and corresponding virtual networks.

    {{<Aside type="note">}}

* Currently, Cloudflare does not support entering the same endpoint IP addresses more than once, even when using different virtual networks.
* All endpoints with private IPs must have `virtual_network_id` specified.

{{<tab label="api" no-code="true">}}

To get a list of your current virtual networks, use the [List virtual networks](/api/operations/tunnel-virtual-network-list-virtual-networks) API operation.

Enable virtual/private IP support by adding the `virtual_network_id` field to the origins in you API request. Refer to the [Cloudflare Load Balancer API documentation](/api/operations/account-load-balancer-pools-create-pool) for more information on how to create a pool using the API.

Consider the following example for updating an existing Load Balancer pool with a Virtual IP origin using cURL.

All origins with private IPs must have `virtual_network_id` specified.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/load_balancers/pools/{pool_id} \
--header "X-Auth-Email: <EMAIL>" \
--header "X-Auth-Key: <API_KEY>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
	"origins": [
		{
			"name": "origin-1",
			"address": "10.0.0.1",
			"enabled": true,
			"weight": 1,
			"virtual_network_id": "a5624d4e-044a-4ff0-b3e1-e2465353d4b4"
		}
	]
}'
```

3. [Create the load balancer](/load-balancing/load-balancers/create-load-balancer/), specifying the pool and monitor you created in the previous steps, as well as the desired [global traffic steering policies](/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) and [custom rules](/load-balancing/additional-options/load-balancing-rules/).

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Spectrum limitations">}}
If you will use the load balancer with [Spectrum](/spectrum/), consider the applicable [limitations](/load-balancing/additional-options/spectrum/#limitations) on load balancing and monitoring options.
