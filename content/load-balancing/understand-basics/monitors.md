# Monitors

{{<render file="_monitor-definition.md">}}
<br/>
{{<render file="_health-check-diagram.md">}}

Health checks that result in a status change for an origin server are recorded as events in the Load Balancing event logs.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Health checks associated with load balancers are different from [**Standalone health checks**](/health-checks/).

## Host header prioritization

When a load balancer runs health checks, headers set on an origin override headers set on a monitor. For more details, refer to [Override HTTP Host headers](/load-balancing/additional-options/override-http-host-headers/).
