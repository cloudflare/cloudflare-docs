Cloudflare partners with $1 to provide $1 customers’ websites with Cloudflare’s performance and security benefits.

If you use $1 and also have a Cloudflare Enterprise plan, you can use your own Cloudflare accounts to proxy web traffic. This setup option is called [orange-to-orange (O2O)](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).

O2O applies both your and $1’s security settings.
