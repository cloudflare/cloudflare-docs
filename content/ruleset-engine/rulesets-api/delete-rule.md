# Delete a rule in a ruleset

Deletes a single rule in a ruleset at the account or zone level.

Use one of the following API endpoints:

| Operation                                    | Method + Endpoint                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Delete an account ruleset rule][dr-account] | `DELETE /accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/rulesets/<RULESET_ID>/rules/<RULE_ID>` |
| [Delete a zone ruleset rule][dr-zone]        | `DELETE /zones/<ZONE_ID>/rulesets/<RULESET_ID>/rules/<RULE_ID>`       |

[dr-account]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/account-rulesets-delete-an-account-ruleset-rule
[dr-zone]: https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zone-rulesets-delete-a-zone-ruleset-rule

If the delete operation succeeds, the API method call returns a `200 OK` HTTP status code with the complete ruleset in the response body.

## Example

The following example deletes rule `<RULE_ID_1>` belonging to ruleset `<RULESET_ID>`.
