# Rules language

The Cloudflare Rules language is a flexible and intuitive specification for building rule expressions. Based on the widely known [Wireshark display filters](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html), the Rules language allows you to precisely target HTTP requests with a syntax and semantics familiar to security engineers.

When evaluating a rule, Cloudflare compares values associated with an HTTP request to those defined in the rule's [expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/). If the expression evaluates `true`, Cloudflare triggers the [action](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/) for that rule.
