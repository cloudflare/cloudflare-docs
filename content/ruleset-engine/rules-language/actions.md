# Actions reference

The action of a rule tells Cloudflare how to handle matches for the rule [expression](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/expressions/).

## Supported actions

The table below lists the actions available in the Rules language.

Some actions, like _Block_, will stop the evaluation of the remaining rules. The _Skip_ action will skip the evaluation of _some_ rules when there is a match, but the exact behavior will depend on the rule configuration.

The available actions depend on the [phase](/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) where you are configuring the rule. Refer to each product’s documentation for details on the phase(s) supported by that product.

        <ul>
          <li>Show a non-interactive challenge page (similar to the current JS Challenge).</li>
          <li>Present an invisible proof of work challenge to the browser.</li>

        <p>
          Depending on the rule configuration, matching requests will skip the evaluation of one or
          more security features or products:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Skip all remaining rules in the current ruleset</li>

            <li>Skip specific security products that are not based on the Ruleset Engine</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The available skip options depend on the phase where you configure the rule. Refer to each
          product’s documentation for details.
