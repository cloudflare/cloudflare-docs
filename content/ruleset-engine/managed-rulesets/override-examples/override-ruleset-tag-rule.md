# Deploy a managed ruleset with ruleset, tag, and rule overrides

Customize the execution of managed rulesets with a combination of ruleset overrides, tag overrides, and rule overrides in your phase entry point ruleset.

1.  [Add a rule](/ruleset-engine/basic-operations/deploy-rulesets/) to a phase entry point ruleset to execute a managed ruleset.
2.  [Configure a ruleset override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that disables all rules in the managed ruleset.
3.  [Configure a tag override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets an action for rules with a given tag.
4.  [Configure a rule override](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) that sets an action for the rules you want to execute.

The request below uses the [Update ruleset](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/update/) operation to execute the following in a single `PUT` request:

*   Add a rule to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset that executes a managed ruleset.
*   Use category overrides to enable rules with `wordpress` and `drupal` tags and set their actions to `log`.
*   Add a rule override that enables a single rule.

<div>

In this example:

*   `"id": "<MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"` adds a rule to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase entry point ruleset to execute a managed ruleset for requests addressed to a zone (`<ZONE_ID>`).
*   `"enabled": false` defines an override at the ruleset level to disable all rules in the managed ruleset.
*   `"categories": [{"category": "wordpress", "action": "log", "enabled": true}, {"category": "drupal", "action": "log", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the tag level to enable rules tagged with `wordpress` or `drupal` and sets their action to `log`.
*   `"rules": [{"id": "<RULE_ID>", "action": "block", "enabled": true}]` defines an override at the rule level that enables one individual rule and sets the action to `block`.
