# Deploy rulesets

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to deploy a ruleset. To deploy a ruleset, add a rule with `"action": "execute"` to a phase entry point ruleset, specifying the ruleset ID to execute as an action parameter. Use a separate rule for each ruleset you want to deploy.

A rule that executes a ruleset consists of:

*   The **ID of the ruleset** you want to execute.
*   An **expression**.
*   An **action**, set to `execute`.

The rules in the ruleset execute when a request satisfies the expression.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

To apply a rule to every request in a phase at the **zone** level, set the rule expression to `true`.

## Example

The following example deploys a managed ruleset to the `http_request_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`<ZONE_ID>`) by adding a rule that executes the managed ruleset.

```json
---
header: Request
---
curl -X PUT \
"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
-d '{
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "execute",
      "action_parameters": {
        "id": "<CLOUDFLARE_MANAGED_RULESET_ID>"
      },
      "expression": "true",
      "description": "Execute Cloudflare Managed Ruleset on my zone ruleset"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```json
