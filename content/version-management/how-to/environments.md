## Change environment version

To prevent accidental changes, you can only update an environment's version through the process of **Promotion** or **Roll back**.

For more details on the flow of versions and environments, refer to [How it works](/version-management/about/).

### Promote a version

Promotion moves a version from a lower-ranked environment to the next highest one.
