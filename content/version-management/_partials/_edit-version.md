Before making changes, make sure you are inside the correct version of your zone.

To change between different versions of your zone:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to **Version Management**.
4. On a specific version, select **Select**.

You can also change which version you are in from any page by using the sidebar dropdown.

From within a version, you can update settings just as you would with your normal zone settings. Any changes are saved automatically.
