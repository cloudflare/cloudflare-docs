Version Management does not currently support or have limited support for the following products or features: 

{{<details header="API Shield">}}
- Some [API Shield](/api-shield/) settings are not cloned when a new zone version is created.
- Customers are allowed to opt-in to remove the UI block that prevents enabling Version Management.
{{</details>}}

{{<details header="Cache">}}
- [Cache](/workers/runtime-apis/cache/) settings are versioned, but cache keys are not.
- Caching a new URL on staging would cache it for production as well.
- Purging cache on staging would purge it on production too.
- Promoting a new version to production would wipe all exiting cache.
{{</details>}}

{{<details header="Cache Rules when used with Cloudflare Images">}}
- [Image Resizing](/images/) does not work with the `additional_cacheable_ports` [Cache Rule](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) setting and Zone Versioning.
- If you use `additional_cacheable_ports` with Image Resizing, the image will be resized every time it is requested and will result in low performance. 
{{</details>}}

{{<details header="Workers Cache API">}}
- [Workers Cache API](/workers/runtime-apis/cache/) does not work with Version Management.
- If you use the Workers Cache API with Zone Versioning, you might encounter unexpected caching behaviours.

{{</details>}}

{{<details header="Cloudflare API">}}
- Zone Version Management does not currently expose a public [API](/api/).

{{<details header="Domain-scoped Roles">}}
- [Domain-scoped Roles](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/#domain-scoped-roles) apply only to your root zone.
- Once a new version is created, these roles do not copy over and they lose access to versions.
