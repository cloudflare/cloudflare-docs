Version Management does not currently support versioning for [Waiting Room](/waiting-room/), [China Network](/china-network/), [WAF Attack Score](/waf/about/waf-attack-score/) and [API Shield](/api-shield/).

Additionally, you cannot currently manage versioning through the [Cloudflare API](/api/) or deploy Workers used by zones that have enabled versioning via [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/).
