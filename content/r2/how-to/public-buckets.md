# Getting started with Public Buckets on R2

## Overview

Public Bucket is a feature that allows users to expose the contents of their R2 buckets directly to the internet. By default, buckets are never publicly accessible and will always require explicit user permission to enable.

Public buckets can be set up in one of two ways. The first exposes it as a custom domain that you control. The second exposes it as a https://pub-<UUID>.r2.dev/<object> domain that Cloudflare owns. You can use neither (the default), one, or both options as you desire. r2.dev is perfect for testing out a very minimal configuration or if you don't have a domain name you control. Using a custom domain name gives you more fine-grained configuration over the domain like configuring firewall rules, caching, access controls, and bot management.

## Enabling public access for the Bucket

Here’s how you can enable public access for your buckets:

1. Navigate to the R2 product screen using the sidebar

8. You can also see which buckets have public access from the overview page.

**Note**: *To enable Access, Cache and bot management features you'll need to map a custom domain to your public bucket.*

## Connecting the Bucket to a domain

Domain access allows websites to serve content from the associated Bucket. They also benefit from features such as Access, Cache and bot management.

Here’s how you can connect a domain:
1. Select the bucket to connect from the R2 overview screen
2. Navigate to the Settings tab of the bucket
3. Scroll down to the Domain Access section

4. Click on Connect Domain to begin the process of connecting the domain.

5. Enter the domain name you want to connect to and click the Continue button. (Note: Currently, we only support active domains under your account on Cloudflare. Also, you cannot enter domains or subdomains already reserved by other Cloudflare products.)

6. You’ll now see a preview of the new record that will be added to the DNS table. If everything looks good, click Connect Domain.
7. That’s it! The domain is now connected. It takes a few minutes for the status to change from Initializing to Active. You may need to refresh to see the status update. If you notice the status hasn’t changed for a long time, use the Retry connection action (in the overflow menu).

## Remove domain

Here’s how you can remove a domain:

1. Select the bucket from the R2 overview screen for which you want to remove the domain
2. Navigate to the Settings tab of the bucket
3. Scroll down to the Domain Access section
4. Select the domain to disable by navigating to the appropriate overflow button with ellipsis and click Remove domain.

![Remove Domain](/r2/static/public-buckets-remove-domain.png)

5. Click the ‘Remove domain’ button in the confirmation window. Note the CNAME record pointing to the record will also be removed as part of this step. You can always add the domain back.
6. That’s it. The domain is no longer connected and will no longer appear in the connected domains list.
