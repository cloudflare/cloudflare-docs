# Log and store upload events in R2 with event notifications

{{<tutorial-date-info>}}

This example provides a step-by-step guide on using [event notifications](/r2/buckets/event-notifications/) to capture and store R2 upload logs in a separate bucket.

## Prerequisites

To continue, you will need:
- A subscription to [Workers Paid](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers), required for using queues.

## 1. Install Wrangler

To begin, refer to [Install/Update Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#install-wrangler) to install Wrangler, the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI.

## 2. Create R2 buckets

You will need to create two R2 buckets:
- `example-upload-bucket`: When new objects are uploaded to this bucket, your [consumer Worker](/queues/get-started/#5-create-your-consumer-worker) will write logs.
- `example-log-sink-bucket`: Upload logs from `example-upload-bucket` will be written to this bucket.

To create the buckets, run the following Wrangler commands:

```sh
$ npx wrangler r2 bucket create example-upload-bucket
$ npx wrangler r2 bucket create example-log-sink-bucket
```

## 3. Create a queue

{{<Aside type="note">}}

You will need a [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/) to create and use Queues and Cloudflare Workers to consume event notifications.

{{</Aside>}}

Event notifications capture changes to data in `example-upload-bucket`. You will need to create a new queue to receive notifications:

```sh
$ npx wrangler queues create example-event-notification-queue
```

## 4. Create a Worker

Before you enable event notifications for `example-upload-bucket`, you need to create a [consumer Worker](/queues/reference/how-queues-works/#create-a-consumer-worker) to receive the notifications.

Create a new Worker with C3 (`create-cloudflare` CLI). [C3](/pages/get-started/c3/) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications, including Workers, to Cloudflare.

{{<render file="_c3-run-command-with-directory.md" productFolder="workers" withParameters="consumer-worker">}}

{{<render file="_c3-post-run-steps.md" productFolder="workers" withParameters="Hello World example;;Hello World Worker;;TypeScript">}}

Then, move into your newly created directory:

```sh
$ cd consumer-worker
```

## 5. Configure your Worker

In your Worker project's [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) file, add a [queue consumer](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#queues) and [R2 bucket binding](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#r2-buckets). The queues consumer bindings will register your Worker as a consumer of your future event notifications and the R2 bucket bindings will allow your Worker to access your R2 bucket.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
name = "event-notification-writer"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-03-29"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[[queues.consumers]]
queue = "example-event-notification-queue"
max_batch_size = 100
max_batch_timeout = 5

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "LOG_SINK"
bucket_name = "example-log-sink-bucket"
```

## 6. Write event notification messages to R2

Add a [`queue` handler](/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#consumer) to `src/index.ts` to handle writing batches of notifications to our log sink bucket (you do not need a [fetch handler](/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/)):

```ts
---
filename: index.ts
---
export interface Env {
    LOG_SINK: R2Bucket;
}

export default {
	async queue(batch: MessageBatch, env: Env): Promise<void> {
		const batchId = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
		const fileName = `upload-logs-${batchId}.json`;

		// Serialize the entire batch of messages to JSON
		const fileContent = new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(batch.messages));

		// Write the batch of messages to R2
		await env.LOG_SINK.put(fileName, fileContent, {
			httpMetadata: {
			  contentType: "application/json"
			}
		});
	}
};
```

## 7. Deploy your Worker

To deploy your consumer Worker, run the [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) command:

```sh
$ npx wrangler deploy
```

## 8. Enable event notifications

Now that you have your consumer Worker ready to handle incoming event notification messages, you need to enable event notifications with the [`wrangler r2 bucket notification create` command](/workers/wrangler/commands/#notification-create) for `example-upload-bucket`:

```sh
$ npx wrangler r2 bucket notification create example-upload-bucket --event-type object-create --queue example-event-notification-queue
```

## 9. Test

Now you can test the full end-to-end flow by uploading an object to `example-upload-bucket` in the Cloudflare dashboard. After you have uploaded an object, logs will appear in `example-log-sink-bucket` in a few seconds.
