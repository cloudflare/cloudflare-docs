# Limits

{{<Aside type="note">}}

We want to encourage you to build any application you can dream up, and realize that doesn't always fit within our limits.

## Rate limiting on managed public buckets through `r2.dev`

Managed public bucket access through an `r2.dev` subdomain is not intended for production usage, and has a rate limit applied to it. When exceeding this rate limit, requests through your `r2.dev` subdomain will be temporarily throttled, and receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. For production use cases, consider linking a [custom domain](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#custom-domains) to your bucket.

<sup>1</sup>The object size limit is 5 GB less than 5 TB, so 4.995 TB.<br>
<sup>2</sup>The max upload size is 5 MB less than 5 GB, so 4.995 GB.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Max upload size applies to uploading a file via one request, uploading a part of a multipart upload, or
copying into a part of a multipart upload. If you have a Worker, its inbound request size is
constrained by [Workers request limits](/workers/platform/limits#request-limits). The max upload size limit does not apply to subrequests.<br>
Review the [Examples](/r2/examples/) on how to use SDKs with the S3 API to upload large files.<br>
