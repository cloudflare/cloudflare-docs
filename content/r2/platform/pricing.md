# Pricing

R2 charges based on the total volume of data stored, along with two classes of operations on that data:

1. [Class A operations](#class-a-operations) which are more expensive and tend to mutate state. 
2. [Class B operations](#class-b-operations) which tend to read existing state.
 
There are no charges for egress bandwidth.

All included usage is on a monthly basis.

### Storage usage

Storage is billed using gigabyte-month (GB-month) as the billing metric. A GB-month is calculated by recording total bytes stored for the duration of the month. 

For example:

* Storing 1 GB for 30 days will be charged as 1 GB-month.
* Storing 2 GB for 15 days will be charged as 1 GB-month.

### Class A operations

Class A Operations include `ListBuckets`, `PutBucket`, `ListObjects`, `PutObject`, `CopyObject`, `CompleteMultipartUpload`, `CreateMultipartUpload`, `UploadPart`, and `UploadPartCopy`.

### Class B operations

Class B Operations include `HeadBucket`, `HeadObject`, and `GetObject`.

### Free operations

Free operations include `DeleteObject`, `DeleteBucket` and `AbortMultipartUpload`.

## R2 billing examples

#### Example 1

If a user writes 1,000 objects in R2 for 1 month and each object is 1 GB in size and requested 1,000 times per month, the estimated cost for the month would be:

| Class A Operations | (1,000 objects) * (1 write per object)     |    1,000,000 |                 0 |      $0.00 |
| Storage            | (1,000 objects) * (1GB per object)         | 10 GB-months |     990 GB-months |     $14.85 |

#### Example 2

If a user writes the same 1 GB object 1,000,000 times a day and the object is read 10,000,000 times a day, the estimated cost in a month would be:
