<sup>1</sup>The object size limit is 5 GB less than 5 TB, so 4.995 TB.<br>
<sup>2</sup>The max upload size is 5 MB less than 5 GB, so 4.995 GB.<br>
<sup>3</sup>Max upload size applies to uploading a file via one request, uploading a part of a multipart upload, or
copying into a part of a multipart upload. If you have a Worker, its inbound request size is
constrained by [Workers request limits](/workers/platform/limits#request-limits). The max upload size limit does not apply to subrequests.<br>
Review the [Examples](/r2/examples/) on how to use SDKs with the S3 API to upload large files.<br>
<sup>4</sup> During [open beta](/workers/platform/betas/), the number of operations per bucket will be temporarily restricted.
