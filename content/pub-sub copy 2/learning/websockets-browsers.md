# WebSockets and browser clients

Pub/Sub allows you to both publish and subscribe from within a web browser or other WebSocket capable client. Every Pub/Sub Broker supports MQTT over WebSockets natively, without further configuration.

With Pub/Sub’s WebSocket support, you can:

- Subscribe to a topic in the browser and push near real-time updates (such as notifications or chat messages) to those clients from your backend services.
- Publish telemetry directly from WebSocket clients and then aggregate those messages in a centralized service or by using [Workers Analytics Engine](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-analytics-engine/) to consume them on your behalf.
- Publish and subscribe directly between a browser client and your MQTT-capable IoT devices in the field.

When clients are connecting from a browser, you should use [`token` authentication](/pub-sub/platform/authentication-authorization/) and ensure you are issuing clients unique credentials.

## MQTT over WebSockets

WebSocket support in Pub/Sub works by encapsulating MQTT packets (Pub/Sub’s underlying native protocol) within WebSocket [frames](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#exchanging_data_frames).

- In many MQTT libraries, you can replace the `mqtts://` scheme with `wss://`, and your code will use a WebSocket transport instead of the native “raw” TCP transport.
- The WebSocket listener is available on both TCP ports `443` and `8884` versus `8883` for native MQTT.
- WebSocket clients need to speak MQTT over WebSockets. Pub/Sub does not support other message serialization methods over WebSockets at present.
- **Clients should include a `sec-websocket-protocol: mqtt` request header in the initial HTTP GET request** to distinguish an "MQTT over WebSocket" request from future, non-MQTT protocol support over WebSockets.
- Authentication is performed within the WebSocket connection itself. An MQTT `CONNECT` packet inside the WebSocket tunnel includes the required username and password. The WebSocket connection itself does not need to be authenticated at the HTTP level.

We recommend using [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js), one of the most popular JavaScript libraries, for client-side JavaScript support. It can be used in both the browser via Webpack or Browserify and in a Node.js environment.

## JavaScript Web Example

In this example, we use MQTT.js’s WebSocket support to subscribe to a topic and publish messages to it.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
You can view a live demo available at [demo.mqtt.dev](http://demo.mqtt.dev) that allows you to use your own Pub/Sub Broker and a valid token to subscribe to a topic and publish messages to it.

In a real-world deployment, our publisher could be another client, a native MQTT client, or a WebSocket client running on a remote server elsewhere. 

```js
// Ensure MQTT.js is installed first
// > npm install mqtt
import * as mqtt from "mqtt"

// Where 'url' is "mqtts://BROKER.NAMESPACE.cloudflarepubsub.com:8884"
function example(url) {
  let client = mqtt.connect(url, {
    protocolVersion: 5,
    reconnectPeriod: 0,
    username: 'anything',
    password: jwt, // pass this from a form field in your app
    clientId: '',
  })
  
  client.on('connect', function () {
    client.subscribe(topic, function (err) {
      if (err) {
        client.end();
      } else {
        console.log(`subscribed to ${topic}`)
      }
  })
  
  client.on('message', function (topic, message) {
    let line = (new Date()).toLocaleString('en-US') + ": " + message.toString() + "\n";
    console.log(line)
  })
}
```

You can use a JavaScript bundler, such as Webpack, to include the library into a script you can include in your web application.
