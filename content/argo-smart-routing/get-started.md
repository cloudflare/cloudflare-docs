2. Go to **Traffic** > **Argo Smart Routing**.

4. Provide your billing information.

    * If you do not have a [billing profile](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/create-billing-profile/), enter your billing information.

To enable or disable Argo Smart Routing with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/argo-smart-routing-patch-argo-smart-routing-setting) request with the `value` parameter set to your desired setting (`"on"` or `"off"`).

You will need to already have a [billing profile](/fundamentals/account-and-billing/account-setup/create-billing-profile/) on your account to enable Argo Smart Routing.

## Enable Argo Tiered Cache

[Cache](/cache/) works by storing a copy of website content at Cloudflare's data centers. Argo Tiered Cache divides these data centers into a hierarchy based on location. This allows Cloudflare to deliver content from data centers closest to your visitor.

Argo Smart Routing and Argo Tiered Cache work together to provide the most efficient connection for visitors to your site. For more information, go to [Tiered Cache](/cache/about/tiered-cache/).
