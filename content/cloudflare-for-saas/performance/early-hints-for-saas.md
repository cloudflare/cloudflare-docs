# Early Hints for SaaS

[Early Hints](/cache/about/early-hints/) allows the browser to begin loading resources while the origin server is compiling the full response. This improves webpageâ€™s loading speed for the end user. As a SaaS provider, you may prioritize speed for some of your custom hostnames. Using custom metadata, you can [enable Early Hints](/cache/about/early-hints/#enabling-early-hints) per custom hostname.

## Prerequisites

Before you can employ Early Hints for SaaS, you need to create a custom hostname. Review [Get Started with Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/) if you have not already done so.

---

## Enable Early Hints per custom hostname via the API

1. [Locate your zone ID](/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/find-account-and-zone-ids/), available in the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. Locate your Authentication Key by selecting **My Profile** > **API tokens** > **Global API Key**.

3. If you would like to enable Early Hints for a preexisting custom hostname, locate your custom hostname ID by making a `GET` request to the API:

```json
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/custom_hostnames" \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: {email}" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: {key}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

If you are [creating a new custom hostname](https://api.cloudflare.com/#custom-hostname-for-a-zone-create-custom-hostname), make an API call such as the example below, specifying `"early_hints": "on"`:

```json
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/ZONE_ID/custom_hostnames" \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: {email}" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: {key}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '
    {"hostname": "HOSTNAME",
      "ssl": {
        "method": "http",
        "type": "dv",
        "settings": {
          "http2": "on",
          "min_tls_version": "1.2",
          "tls_1_3": "on",
          "early_hints": "on"
        },
        "bundle_method": "ubiquitous",
        "wildcard": false
      }
    }'
```

4. For an existing custom hostname, an API call such as the example below, specifying `"early_hints": "on"`:

```json
$ curl -sXPATCH \
curl -X PATCH "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/ZONE/custom_hostnames/CUSTOM_HOSTNAME_ID" \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: {email}" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: {key}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{
      "ssl": {
        "method": "http",
        "type": "dv",
        "settings": {
          "early_hints": "on"
        }
      }
    }'
```

To get the ID of a single hostname in the list, make this API call:

```json
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/ZONE/custom_hostnames?hostname=CUSTOM_HOSTNAME" \
    -H "X-Auth-Email: {email}" \
    -H "X-Auth-Key: {key}}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
