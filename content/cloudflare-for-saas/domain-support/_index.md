# Custom domain support
 
Cloudflare for SaaS allows you, as a SaaS provider, to extend the benefits of Cloudflare products to custom domains by adding them to your zone as custom hostnames. We support adding hostnames that are a subdomain of your zone (for example, `sub.serviceprovider.com`) and vanity domains (for example, `customer.com`) to your SaaS zone.
 
## Prerequisites
 
Ensure you have reviewed [Get Started with Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/). The following are only applicable once custom hostnames have been created:
 
* [Verify custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-verification/)
* [Migrating custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/migrating-custom-hostnames/)

To further customize hostname specific behavior, refer to [custom metadata](/cloudflare-for-saas/workers-for-platforms/custom-metadata/).
