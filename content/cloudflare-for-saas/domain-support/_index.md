# Custom domain support
 
Cloudflare for SaaS allows end customers to point vanity domains to an application hosted on your Cloudflare zone as the SaaS provider. By adding their domain as a custom hostname on your SaaS zone, you can extend the benefits of Cloudflare to your customers.
 
## Prerequisites
 
Ensure you have reviewed [Get Started with Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/start/getting-started/). The following are only applicable once custom hostnames have been created:
 
* [Verify custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/hostname-verification/)
* [Migrating custom hostnames](/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/migrating-custom-hostnames/)

To further customize hostname specific behavior, refer to [custom metadata](/cloudflare-for-saas/ssl/hostname-specific-behavior/custom-metadata/).
