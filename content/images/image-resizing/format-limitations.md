# Supported formats and limitations

Cloudflare Image Resizing can:

- Read JPEG, PNG, GIF (including animations), and WebP images.
- Resize and generate JPEG and PNG images, and optionally AVIF or WebP.
- Save animations as GIF or animated WebP.
- Support ICC color profiles in JPEG and PNG images.
- Preserve JPEG metadata. Metadata of other formats is discarded.
- Convert the first frame of GIF animations to a still image.

Cloudflare Image Resizing does not:

- Support SVG since this format is inherently scalable and does not need resizing.
- Support HEIC (HEIF) format. Cloudflare does not plan to support this format.

AVIF format is supported on a best-effort basis. Images that cannot be compressed as AVIF will be served as WebP instead.

## Maximum sizes

Maximum image size is 100 megapixels (for example, 10,000Ã—10,000 pixels large). Maximum file size is 70 MB. GIF animations are limited to 100 megapixels total (sum of sizes of all frames).
