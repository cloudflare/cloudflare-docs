# Convert and resize images via URL

You can optimize and resize images by requesting them via a specially-formatted URL. With this option, you can use the new URLs by only changing the HTML markup of your website. 

By default, only images from your enabled zone can be transformed. This prevents third parties from resizing images at any origin using your Images environment.

For more information, refer to [URL format](/images/transform-images/#url-format/).
