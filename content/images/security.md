# Security Best Practices

To further ensure the security and efficiency of image optimization services, you can adopt Cloudflare products that safeguard against malicious activities.

Cloudflare security products like [Cloudflare WAF](/waf/), [Cloudflare Bot Management](/bots/get-started/bm-subscription/) and [Cloudflare Rate Limiting](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) can enhance the protection of your image optimization requests against abuse. This proactive approach ensures a reliable and efficient experience for all legitimate users.
