Sourcing Kit allows you to easily import images from Amazon S3, no matter how many you have. Sourcing kit also allows you to import new images when there is a change on your source. 

With Sourcing Kit you can define one or multiple repositories of images to bulk import them. Once you have these set up, you can reuse those sources and import only new images to your Cloudflare Images account. This helps you make sure that only actual usable images are imported, and skip any other objects or files that might exist in that source. Sourcing Kit also lets you target paths, define prefixes  for imported images, and obtain error logs for bulk operations.
