With Sourcing Kit you can define one or multiple repositories of images to bulk import from Amazon S3. Once you have these set up, you can reuse those sources and import only new images to your Cloudflare Images account. This helps you make sure that only actual usable images are imported, and skip any other objects or files that might exist in that source. 

Sourcing Kit also lets you target paths, define prefixes  for imported images, and obtain error logs for bulk operations.

Sourcing Kit is in beta. If you have any comments, questions, or bugs to report, contact the Images team on our [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/595317990191398933/973591562615390228). You can also engage with other users and the Images team on Cloudflare's [support forum](https://community.cloudflare.com/c/developers/images/63).
