# Images analytics

Cloudflare Images gives you access to analytics data for your account, such as:

- How many images have been served during the current month.
- How many images are stored.
- Your account's storage capacity.

To check analytics for your Images account:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Click **Images**.
3. Scroll down to **Usage**.

## Quota errors

If you exceed your account's quota, you will not be able to upload more images. Further uploads will be rejected with the message `The given account has reached a service limit`.

To avoid this error and upload more images, contact your Customer Success Manager to increase your Cloudflare Images' quota, or [delete images](/images/cloudflare-images/delete-images/) from your account.
