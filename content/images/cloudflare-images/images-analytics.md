# Images analytics

Cloudflare Images gives you access to analytics data for your account, such as:

- How many images have been served during the current month
- How many images are stored
- Your account's storage capacity

To check your account's Image analytics:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Click **Images**.
3. Scroll down to **Usage**.

## Quota errors

If you exceed your account's quota, you will not be able to upload more images. Further uploads will be rejected with the message `The given account has reached a service limit`. Contact your Customer Success Manager to increase your Cloudflare Images' quota.
