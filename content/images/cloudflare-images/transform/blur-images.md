# Blur images

You can apply blur to image variants, except for [SVG files](/images/cloudflare-images/upload-images/formats-limitations/#svg-files). To blur an image, you have to either create a specific variant for this effect first, or edit a previously created variant.

Refer to [Resize images](/images/cloudflare-images/transform/resize-images/) to learn how to create variants. You can also refer to the API to learn how to use blur [using flexible variants](/images/cloudflare-images/transform/flexible-variants/#blur).

To apply blur to an image:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Select **Images** > **Variants**.
3. Find the variant you want to apply blur to, and select **Edit** > **Customization Options**.
4. Use the slider to adjust the blurring effect. You can use the preview image to see how strong the blurring effect will be.
5. Select **Save**.

You now have a variant with a blurring effect applied to your image.
