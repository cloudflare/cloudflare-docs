# Blur images

You can apply blur to your images from the Images Dashboard. Blur is applied to image variants. If you plan on blurring your images, you will have to create a specific variant for this effect first.

To apply blur to an image:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account.
2. Click **Images**.
3. In the Images dashboard, click **Variants**.
4. Find the variant you want to apply blur to, and click **Edit** > **Customization Options**.
5. Use the slider to adjust the blurring effect. You can use the preview image to see how strong the blurring effect will be.
6. Click **Save**.

You now have a variant with a blurring effect applied to your image.
