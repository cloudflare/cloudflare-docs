# Edit images

The Edit option, available from the main Images screen, is your one-stop location for options related with a specific image. Selecting **Edit** on the image you are interested in, opens a new page with all the options available, such as:

* Require Signed URLs to use with that particular image
* cURL command you can use as an example to access the image
* Fully-formed URLs for all the variants configured in your account.

2. In Account Home, select **Images**.
3. Locate the image you want to edit, and select **Edit**.
