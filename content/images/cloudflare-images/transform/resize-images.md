# Resize images

Resizing images in Cloudflare Images works by creating variants of your image. Variants let you specify how images should be resized for different use cases. Cloudflare Images ships with a default `public` variant, but you can create up to 100 variants to fit your needs.

Each variant has several properties, including the width and height of resized images.

## Fit options

The **Fit** property describes how the width and height dimensions should be interpreted. The chart below describes each of the options:

{{<table-wrap>}}

| Fit Options | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Scale down  | Image will be shrunk in size to fully fit within the given width or height, but will not be enlarged. |
| Contain     | Image will be resized (shrunk or enlarged) to be as large as possible within the given width or height while preserving the aspect ratio. |
| Cover       | Image will be resized to exactly fill the entire area specified by width and height, and will be cropped if necessary. |
| Crop        | Image will be shrunk and cropped to fit within the area specified by width and height. The image will not be enlarged. For images smaller than the given dimensions it is the same as `scale-down`. For images larger than the given dimensions, it is the same as `cover`. |
| Pad         | Image will be resized (shrunk or enlarged) to be as large as possible within the given width or height while preserving the aspect ratio, and the extra area will be filled with a background color (white by default). |

## Metadata options

Variants allow you to choose what to do with your image's metadata information, on the **Metadata** property:

- Strip all metadata
- Strip all metadata except copyright
- Keep all metadata

## Override image-level access

Selecting the **Always allow public access** option will make a particular variant always publicly accessible, even when [making images private](/images/cloudflare-images/make-an-image-private/).
