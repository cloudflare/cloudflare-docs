# Cloudflare Images

Cloudflare Images lets you set up an image pipeline in minutes. Build a scalable image pipeline to store, resize, optimize and deliver images in a fast and secure manner.

To get started with Cloudflare Images, visit the Images dashboard in your Cloudflare account if you already have Cloudflare Images, or [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/images) first.

Images you upload to Cloudflare Images are not attached to any domain in your Cloudflare account and you do not need a domain on Cloudflare to use the Cloudflare Images product.
