# Custom ID

You can use a custom path to upload images to Cloudflare Images, instead of the path automatically generated by Cloudflare Images’ Universal Unique Identifier (UUID). The custom path has the following properties:

- Could be up to 1024 characters long.
- Could include any number of subpaths.
- Supports the [UTF-8 encoding standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) for characters.

Below is an example of the custom ID feature using upload via URL:

```bash
curl --request POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<​​ACCOUNT_ID>/images/v1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer :<API_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'url=https://<REMOTE_PATH_TO_IMAGE>' \
  --form 'id=<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>'
```

You can also use the custom ID feature with direct file upload:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/images/v1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer :<API_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'file=@./<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>' \
  --form 'id=<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>'
```

You will then receive a response similar to this: 

```json
{
  "result": {
    "id": "<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>",
    "filename": "<YOUR_IMAGE>",
    "uploaded": "2022-04-20T09:51:09.559Z",
    "requireSignedURLs": false,
    "variants": ["https://imagedelivery.net/Vi7wi5KSItxGFsWRG2Us6Q/<PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE>/public"]
  },
  "result_info": null,
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

You can use the custom ID feature with the ability to [serve images from custom domains](/images/cloudflare-images/serve-images/#serving-images-from-custom-domains) for added flexibility.
