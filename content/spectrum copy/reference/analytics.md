## Analytics request structure

```txt
/api/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/analytics/events/summary?metrics=METRICS&dimensions=DIMENSIONS&filters=FILTERS&since=FROM_TS&sort=SORT&until=TO_TS&limit=LIMIT
/api/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/analytics/events/bytime?metrics=METRICS&dimensions=DIMENSIONS&filters=FILTERS&since=FROM_TS&sort=SORT&until=TO_TS&limit=LIMIT
```

- METRICS is one or more metrics (such as count) to compute
- DIMENSIONS can be used to break down the data by given attributes
- FILTERS used to filter rows by one or more dimensions (see Filters section below)
- SORT is the sort order for the result set; sort fields must be included in METRICS or DIMENSIONS
- TO_TS is that end of time interval to query, defaults to current time
- FROM_TS is that start of time interval to query, defaults to TO_TS - 6 hours
- STEP is used to select time series resolution when using endpoint:
- auto or omitted - selects time step most appropriate to time interval
  - year
  - quarter
  - month
  - week
  - day
  - hour

## Analytics query example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/spectrum/analytics/events/summary?metrics=count&dimensions=event,appID&since=2018-01-01T16:57:00Z" \
   -H "X-Auth-Email: you@email.com" \
   -H "X-Auth-Key: 0000" \
