## Common uses

Bot Management customers can use Bot Analytics to:

- Understand traffic during [your onboarding phase](/bots/get-started/bm-subscription/).
- Tune WAF custom rules to be effective but not overly aggressive.
- Study recent attacks to find trends and detailed information.
- Learn more about Cloudflareâ€™s detection engines with real data.

## API

Data from Bot Analytics is also available via the GraphQL API. You can access bot scores, bot sources, [Bot Tags](/bots/concepts/cloudflare-bot-tags/), and bot _decisions_ (_automated_, _likely automated_, etc.), and more.

Read the [GraphQL Analytics API documentation](/analytics/graphql-api/) for more information about GraphQL and basic querying.
