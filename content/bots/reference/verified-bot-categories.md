# Verified Bot categories

You can segment your verified bot traffic by its type and purpose by adding the Verified Bot categories field `cf.verified_bot_category` as a filter criteria in [WAF Custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/), [Advanced Rate Limiting](/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), and Late Transform rules.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
The Verified Bot categories field is not compatible with legacy Firewall rules.
