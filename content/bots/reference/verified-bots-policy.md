# Verified Bots Policy

In order to be listed by Cloudflare as a {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="verified bot" link="/bots/concepts/bot/#verified-bots">}}verified bot{{</glossary-tooltip>}}, your {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="bot">}}bot{{</glossary-tooltip>}} must conform to the below requirements. To provide the best possible protection to our customers, this policy may change in the future as we adapt to new bot behaviors.

## Bot Policy

### Minimum Traffic

A bot or proxy must have a minimum amount of traffic for Cloudflare to be able find it in the sampled data. The minimum traffic should have more than 1000 requests per day across multiple domains. 

### Minimum Zones

Service must be made for a widespread use of zones. 

#### Example

A bot crawling one site is not valid. 

### Bot Identification

The user-agent with the following requirements: 
* Have at least 5 characters.
* Must not contain special characters.
* Must not include the same user-agent of another verified service. 

#### Example

`GoogleBot/1.0` is a valid UA. 

### Domain Owner Consent

Domains should only be crawled with the explicit or implicit consent of the zone's owner or terms of use. Search engines crawlers must read the `robots.txt` to exclude paths to crawl from the owner. 

#### Example

A tool trying to scalp inventories from different websites might be breaking terms of use while a search engine bot indexing websites but complying with `robots.txt` is a valid service. 

### Service Purpose

The purpose of the service should be benign or helpful to both the owner of a zone and the users of the service. The service cannot perform any of the following: 

* Bot tooling
* Scalpers
* Credential-stuffing
* Directory-traversal scanning
* Excessive data scraping
* DDoS botnets

#### Example

Price scraping direct ecommerce competitors is not a valid use case.

### Crawling Etiquette 

The crawling etiquette should check `robots.txt` if crawling the whole website, and it should not attempt to crawl sensitive paths. 

#### Example

If a search engine crawler skips `robots.txt`, it will be rejected.

### Public Documentation

The bot must have publicly documented expected behavior or user-agent format.

## IP Validation 

A set of validation methods and requirements to gather set IP ranges for a verified service.

### Public IP List 

* A fixed and limited set of IP addresses, which can be verified via publicly accessible plain-text, `JSON`, or `CSV`.
* IP addresses used solely by the bot owner.
* A user-agent match pattern.

### Reverse DNS 

* A list of domain suffixes to validate DNS records.
* IP addresses should have PTR records set correctly.
* A user-agent match pattern.

### ASN 

* A valid `ASN` belonging to the bot owner.
* A user-agent match pattern.

## Breach of Policy 

If any of the requirements to validate are breached, a service will be removed from the global allowlist.

#### Example breaches of policy

* Adding a set of IPs that are not solely used by verified service. 
* The service IPs are breached by an attacker. 
* The service has vulnerabilities that have not been patched.
* A block of IPs not briefed on onboarding is added to the list. 
* The disclosed purpose of the service does not reflect on the traffic.
* An AI Crawler that does not respect the crawl-delay directive in robots.txt.

## Online application

To submit a verified bot that Cloudflare is not [currently tracking](https://radar.cloudflare.com/verified-bots), fill out an [online application](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/configurations/verified-bots) in the Cloudflare dashboard for the fastest possible results. Bot operators who prefer not to create a free Cloudflare account can do so using our [old form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqYNuULEypMnp4i5pROSc-uP6x65Xub9svD27mb8JChA_-XA/viewform?usp=sf_link), but the waiting time is up to several weeks for verified bot requests to be evaluated.

## Transient false negatives

Once Cloudflare lists a bot as a verified bot, this entry is cached and may get delisted if no traffic is seen in the Cloudflare network coming from the bot for a defined period of time. 

It takes 24 hours for an inactive IP to be removed as a verified bot. 

A bot can remain unlisted until Cloudflare sees traffic being sourced from the bot. When the bot is revalidated, it is listed as a verified bot again.
