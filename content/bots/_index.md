# Cloudflare bot solutions

Cloudflare bot solutions identify and mitigate automated traffic to protect your domain from bad bots.

While Cloudflare offers several products that relate to bot traffic, this section reviews our *bot-specific products*, Bot Fight Mode, Super Bot Fight Mode, and Bot Management for Enterprise.

## Which bot solution do I need?

If you have a smaller domain and have identified a bot problem, we recommend Bot Fight Mode or Super Bot Fight Mode, which are included with your plan subscription. You can enable either from your dashboard, but these solutions offer limited configuration options.

If you have a large domain with a lot of traffic, we recommend Bot Management for Enterprise, especially for customers in ecommerce, banking, and security. To enable Bot Management for Enterprise and write rules to customize your bot protection, contact your account team.

To see the differences in features and functionality, visit [Plans](/bots/plans/).
