# Get started with Bot Fight Mode

Bot Fight Mode is a simple, free product that helps detect and mitigate bot traffic on your domain. When enabled, the product:

- Identifies traffic matching patterns of known bots
- Issues computationally expensive challenges in response to these bots
- Notifies [Bandwidth Alliance](https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/) partners (if applicable) to disable bots

## Enable Bot Fight Mode

To start using Bot Fight Mode:

1.  Go to **Firewall**.
2.  Select **Bots**.
3.  For **Bot Fight Mode**, select **On**.

## Visibility

You can see bot-related actions by going to **Firewall** > **Overview**. Any requests challenged by this product will be labeled **Bot Fight Mode** in the **Service** field. This allows you to observe, analyze, and follow trends in your bot traffic over time.
