## Analytics

### Bot Report

Use the **Bot Report** to monitor bot traffic for the past 24 hours.

To access the **Bot Report**, go to **Security** > **Bots**. If you see a double-digit percentage of automated traffic, you may want to upgrade to [Bot Management](/bots/plans/bm-subscription/) to save money on origin costs and protect your domain from large-scale attacks.

### Security events

You can see bot-related actions by going to **Security** > **Events**. Any requests challenged by this product will be labeled **Super Bot Fight Mode** in the **Service** field. This allows you to observe, analyze, and follow trends in your bot traffic over time.
