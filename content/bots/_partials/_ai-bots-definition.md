You can block artificial intelligence (AI) bots, crawlers, and scrapers from scraping your website content and training large language models (LLM) to recreate it without your permission. When you enable this feature, Cloudflare deploys a custom rule to detect and block AI bots from your website.

This feature is available on all Cloudflare plans.
