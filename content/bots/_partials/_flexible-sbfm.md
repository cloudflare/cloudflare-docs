In parts of your site where you want bot traffic, you can use the `Skip` action in Custom Rules to specify where Super Bot Fight Mode should not run. 

To enable the `Skip` action in Custom Rules, refer to the [WAF documentation](/waf/custom-rules/skip/). Skip rules are only available to customers who have [migrated from Firewall Rules to Custom Rules](/waf/reference/migration-guides/firewall-rules-to-custom-rules/).
