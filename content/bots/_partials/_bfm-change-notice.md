{{<Aside type="warning" header="Change notice for Super Bot Fight Mode rulesets">}}

Cloudflare is changing the way you configure Super Bot Fight Mode rules. No action is need at this time. However, Cloudflare will deprecate the ability to modify the `http_request_sbfm` phase via the public Cloudflare API.
