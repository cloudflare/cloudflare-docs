Super Bot Fight Mode runs during the `http_request_sbfm` phase of the [Ruleset Engine](/ruleset-engine/about/phases/).

<Aside type='warning' header='Changes to SBFM Rulesets are incoming'>

We are changing the way that super bot fight mode rules are configured. **No action is need at this time**. However, be aware that we will be deprecating the ability to modify the `http_request_sbfm` phase via the public API.
