If you have a smaller domain and have identified a bot problem, we recommend Bot Fight Mode or Super Bot Fight Mode, which are included with your plan subscription. You can enable either from your dashboard, but these solutions offer limited configuration options.

If you have a large domain with a lot of traffic, we recommend Bot Management for Enterprise, especially for customers in ecommerce, banking, and security. To enable Bot Management for Enterprise and write rules to customize your bot protection, contact your account team.
