The Challenge Solve Rate (CSR) is the percentage of issued challenges — Interactive Challenge, JS Challenge, or Managed Challenge actions — that were solved. 

```sql
CSR = number of challenges solved / number of challenges issued
```

This metric helps you evaluate your rule's effectiveness, as well as whether you need to make any adjustments to the rule's criteria or action.
