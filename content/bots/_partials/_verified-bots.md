Cloudflare maintains an internal list of **Verified Bots** that are associated with search engine optimization (SEO), website monitoring, and more.

You can use this list to prevent any bot protection measures from impacting otherwise helpful bots, such as search crawlers.

For a partial list of verified bots, refer to [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/verified-bots).
