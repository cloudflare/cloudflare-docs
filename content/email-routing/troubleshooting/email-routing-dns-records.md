## Troubleshooting misconfigured DNS records

1. Select **Settings**. Email Routing will show you the status of your DNS records, such as a `Missing` record or multiple SPF records.
2. Select `Enable Email Routing`.
3. The next page will show you what kind of action is needed. For example, if you are missing DNS records, select **Add records and enable**. If there is a problem with your SPF records, refer to [Troubleshooting SPF records](/email-routing/troubleshooting/spf-records/).

Email Routing should now be working.
