# Troubleshooting

Email Routing warns you when your DNS records are not properly configured. In Email Routing's **Overview** page, you will see a message explaining what type of problem your account's DNS records have. You might see a message such as `Email Routing is currently disabled and not routing emails` when you have missing DNS records. When there is some type of incorrect configuration, you might see a message such as `Email Routing records are not configured. There might be some conflict or missing records. Configure the records to make sure Email Routing works properly`.

When this happens, refer to Email Routing's **Settings** tab for more information. Here, Email routing will list which records are missing or warn you about duplicate sender policy framework (SPF) records.
