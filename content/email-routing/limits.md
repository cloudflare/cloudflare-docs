# Limits

## Email Workers size limits

When you process emails with Email Workers and you are on [Workersâ€™ free pricing tier](/workers/platform/pricing/) you might encounter an allocation error. This may happen due to the size of the emails you are processing and/or the complexity of your Email Worker. Refer to [Worker limits](/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits) for more information.

You can use the [log functionality for Workers](/workers/observability/logging/) to look for messages related to CPU limits (such as `EXCEEDED_CPU`) and troubleshoot any issues regarding allocation errors.

If you encounter these error messages frequently, consider upgrading to the [Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/) for higher usage limits.

## Message size

Currently, Email Routing does not support messages bigger than 25 MiB.
