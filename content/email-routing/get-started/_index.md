# Get started

To enable Email Routing, start by creating a custom email address linked to a destination address. This forms a **rule**. You can toggle rules on or off from the Clouflare dashboard. Refer to [Enable Email Routing](/email-routing/get-started/enable-email-routing) for more details.

The first time you access Email Routing, you will see a wizard guiding you through the process of creating rules. You can skip the wizard and add rules manually.

If you need to pause Email Routing or offboard to another service, refer to the [Settings page](/email-routing/get-started/settings) where you can find the options to do so.
