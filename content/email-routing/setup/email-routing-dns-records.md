# Email Routing DNS records

Email Routing's Settings section allows you to lock or unlock your DNS records, and also view a list of the DNS records needed for Email Routing to work. If your account's DNS records are correctly configured, Email Routing will show you a green `Email DNS records configured` message. 

Click **View DNS records** for a list of the required MX and sender policy framework (SPF) records Email Routing is using. If you are having trouble with your account's DNS records, refer to the [Troubleshooting](/email-routing/troubleshooting/) section.

## Start disabling

The **Start disabling** button allows you to delete Email routing from your account or keep your records and migrate to another provider. Refer to [Disable Email Routing](/email-routing/setup/disable-email-routing/) for more information.
