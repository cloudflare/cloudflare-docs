## View metrics of your widgets

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. From the dashboard, select **Turnstile** and navigate to your website to see an overview of its widget metrics.

These metrics show changes in the solve rate, widget traffic, and top actions for your website.
