# Testing

## Dummy sitekeys and secret keys

The following {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="sitekey">}}sitekeys{{</glossary-tooltip>}} and {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="secret key">}}secret keys{{</glossary-tooltip>}} are available for testing. It is recommended that you use these keys in your development environment to ensure the challenges running in Turnstile do not conflict with your developer tools.

| Sitekey | Description | Visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1x00000000000000000000AA` | Always passes | visible |
| `2x00000000000000000000AB` | Always blocks | visible |
| `1x00000000000000000000BB` | Always passes | invisible |
| `2x00000000000000000000BB` | Always blocks | invisible |
| `3x00000000000000000000FF` | Forces an interactive challenge | visible |

| Secret key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | Always passes |
| `2x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | Always fails | 
| `3x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | Yields a "token already spent" error | 


## Testing locally

To test locally with real keys, you need to add your testing hostnames (like `localhost`) to your [domain whitelist](/turnstile/reference/domain-management/).
