# Rotate the secret key

Customers are able to rotate the secret key using the following steps: 

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account.
2. From the dashboard, select **Turnstile**.
3. In the widget overview, select **Settings** > **Rotate Secret**.

The rotation occurs over the course of 2 hours. During this time, both the old secret key and the new secret key are valid. This allows customers to swap the secret key while avoiding any issues with their website.
