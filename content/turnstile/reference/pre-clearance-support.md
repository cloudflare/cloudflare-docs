# Pre-Clearance support for single-page applications

You can integrate Cloudflare challenges on single-page applications (SPAs) by allowing Turnstile to issue a Pre-Clearance cookie. The Pre-Clearance level is set upon widget creation or widget modification using the Turnstile API's `clearance_level`. Possible values for the configuration are `no_clearance`, `jschallenge`, `managed`,  or `interactive`. All widgets are set to `no_clearance` by default.

For Enterprise customers eligible to toggle off domain checks, Cloudflare recommends issuing Pre-Clearance cookies on widgets where at least one domain is specified.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Pre-Clearance cookies only support zones that are orange-clouded.

Refer to the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/integrating-turnstile-with-the-cloudflare-waf-to-challenge-fetch-requests) for an example of Pre-Clearance implementation.

## Pre-Clearance level options

- **Interactive**: Interactive Pre-Clearance allows a user with a clearance cookie to not be challenged by Interactive, Managed Challenge, or JavaScript Challenge Firewall Rules

- **Managed**: Managed allows a user with a clearance cookie to not be challenged by Managed Challenge or JavaScript Challenge Firewall Rules

- **Non-interactive**: Non-interactive allows a user with a clearance cookie to not be challenged by JavaScript Challenge Firewall Rules

### Duration

Clearance cookies generated by the Turnstile widget will be valid for the time specified by the zone-level Challenge Passage value. To configure the Challenge Passage setting, refer to the [WAF documentation](/waf/tools/challenge-passage/).
