# Widget types 

Every instance of Turnstile belongs to a Turnstile widget. It is configured on a per-widget level. Every widget has a mode, a label, a sitekey, and a secret key. 

The 3 modes for Turnstile are **Managed**, **Non-Interactive**, and **Invisible**.

## Managed (recommended)

Cloudflare will use information from the visitor to decide if an interactive challenge should be used. If we show an interaction, the user will be prompted to check a box (no images or text to decipher).

### Light mode

## Non-Interactive

Users will see a widget with a loading bar while the browser challenges run. Users will never be required or prompted to interact with the widget.

## Invisible

Users will not see a widget or any indication that an invisible browser challenge is in progress. Invisible challenges should take a few seconds to complete.
