## Dummy sitekeys and secret keys

The following {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="sitekey">}}sitekeys{{</glossary-tooltip>}} and {{<glossary-tooltip term_id="secret key">}}secret keys{{</glossary-tooltip>}} are available for testing. It is recommended that you use these keys in your development environment to ensure the challenges running in Turnstile do not conflict with your developer tools.

To test locally with real keys, you need to add your testing hostnames (like `localhost`) to your [domain allowlist](/turnstile/concepts/domain-management/).

Dummy sitekeys can be used from any domain, including on `localhost`.

Cloudflare recommends that sitekeys used in production do not allow local domains (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`), but users can choose to add local domains to the list of allowed domains.

| Sitekey | Description | Visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1x00000000000000000000AA` | Always passes | visible |
| `2x00000000000000000000AB` | Always blocks | visible |
| `1x00000000000000000000BB` | Always passes | invisible |
| `2x00000000000000000000BB` | Always blocks | invisible |
| `3x00000000000000000000FF` | Forces an interactive challenge | visible |

These dummy sitekeys will produce the `XXXX.DUMMY.TOKEN.XXXX` dummy response token.
Production secret keys will reject this token, so for testing purposes you also need to use a dummy secret key.


| Secret key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | Always passes |
| `2x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | Always fails |
| `3x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | Yields a "token already spent" error |

Dummy secret keys will accept any response token as valid, so make sure to never use them in production.
