# Rotate the secret key

Customers are able to rotate the secret key using the following steps: 

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. *Step to get to landing page*
3. Select a widget and navigate to the **Settings**.
4. Select **Rotate Secret**.

The rotation occurs over the course of 2 hours. During this time, both the old secret key and the new secret key are valid. This allows customers to swap the secret key while avoiding any issues with their website.
