Cloudflare issues challenges through the [Challenge Platform](/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/), which is the same underlying technology powering [Turnstile](/turnstile/).

In contrast to our Challenge page offerings, Turnstile allows the customer to run challenges anywhere on their site in a less-intrusive way without requiring the use of Cloudflareâ€™s CDN.
