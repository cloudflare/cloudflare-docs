# Turnstile

Turnstile is a Cloudflare security product designed to stop non-human web visitors. It can be embedded into any website and works without showing visitors a CAPTCHA.

In contrast to our Challenge page offerings, Turnstile allows the customer to run challenges anywhere on their site in a less-intrusive way.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Turnstile is reCAPTCHA compatible. Customers using reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha today can switch seamlessly to Cloudflare Turnstile.

{{</Aside>}}

Customers are able to choose the widget type via Turnstile. This helps avoid [CAPTCHAs](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/how-captchas-work/), which also reduces the lifetimes of human time spent solving CAPTCHAs across the Internet.

Turnstile [widget types](/turnstile/reference/widget-types) include:

* A non-interactive challenge.
* An invisible challenge to the browser.
* A non-intrusive interactive challenge (such as clicking a button), if the visitor is a suspected bot.
