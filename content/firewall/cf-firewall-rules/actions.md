# Firewall rules actions

{{<content-column>}}

The action of a firewall rule tells Cloudflare how to handle HTTP requests that have matched the rule expression.

## Supported actions

The table below lists the actions available in firewall rules. These actions are listed in order of precedence. If the same request matches two different rules which have the same priority, precedence determines the action to take.

For example, the _Allow_ action takes precedence over the _Block_ action. In a case where a request matches a rule with the _Allow_ action and another with the _Block_ action, precedence resolves the tie, and Cloudflare allows the request.

There are two exceptions to this behavior: the _Log_ and _Bypass_ actions. Unlike other actions, _Log_ and _Bypass_ do not terminate further evaluation within firewall rules. This means that if a request matches two different rules and one of those rules specifies the _Log_ or _Bypass_ action, the second action will be triggered instead, even though _Log_/_Bypass_ has precedence.

              Depending on the characteristics of a request, Cloudflare will dynamically choose the appropriate type of challenge from the following actions based on specific criteria:

                  Show a non-interactive challenge page (similar to the current JS Challenge).

## Notes about challenge actions

When you configure a firewall rule with one of the challenge actions — _Managed Challenge_, _JS Challenge_, or _Interactive Challenge_ — and a request matches the rule, one of two things can happen:

* The request is blocked if the visitor fails the challenge
* The request is allowed if the visitor passes the challenge

In this last case, no further firewall rules will be processed. This means that the action of any later rules with a challenge or _Block_ action also matching the request will not be applied, and the request will be allowed.
