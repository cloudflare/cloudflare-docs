# Manage Firewall Rules via the APIs

When it comes to programmatic Firewall Rule management, Cloudflare offers APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI based **Firewall Rules** feature of the **Firewall** app in the dashboard.

These APIs are the following:

*   [**Firewall Rules API**](/api/cf-firewall-rules): Manage Firewall Rules and their actions, based on criteria separately defined through filters.
*   [**Filters API**](/api/cf-filters): Manage the filters that enable rule matching.
*   [**Rules Lists API**](/api/cf-lists): Manage named lists of IP addresses that you can use within Firewall Rules to filter traffic.
