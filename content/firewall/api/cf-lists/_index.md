# Lists API

The Lists API supports different types of lists:

*   Use [IP Lists](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/rules-lists/) to create a group of IP addresses and refer to them collectively, by name, in your firewall rule expressions.

*   Use [Bulk Redirect Lists](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/) to define lists of redirects that you enable by creating a Bulk Redirect Rule.

The [Lists API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#lists-properties) provides an interface for programmatically managing these types of lists.

To use an IP List in a rule expression, refer to [Values: Lists](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/values/#lists) in the Rules language documentation.

## Get started

To get started, review the Lists [JSON object](/firewall/api/cf-lists/json-object/) and [Endpoints](/firewall/api/cf-lists/endpoints/).
