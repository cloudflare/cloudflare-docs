# Manage firewall rules via the APIs

Cloudflare offers APIs that work together to achieve the same effect as the UI-based **Firewall rules** feature under **Security** > **WAF**.

These APIs are the following:

* [**Firewall Rules API**](/firewall/api/cf-firewall-rules/): Manage firewall rules and their actions, based on criteria separately defined through filters.
* [**Filters API**](/firewall/api/cf-filters/): Manage the filters that enable rule matching.
* [**Rules Lists API**](/firewall/api/cf-lists/): Manage named lists of IP addresses that you can use in firewall rules to filter traffic.
