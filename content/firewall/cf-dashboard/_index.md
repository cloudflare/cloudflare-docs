# Manage firewall rules in the Cloudflare dashboard

To configure firewall rules in the Cloudflare dashboard, open **Firewall rules** in **Security** > **WAF**.

As depicted in the image below, the **Firewall rules** dashboard interface lets you:

*   [Create](/firewall/cf-dashboard/create-edit-delete-rules/#create-a-firewall-rule) new rules.
*   Search and filter the list of existing rules.
*   See a list of existing rules (both active and paused).
*   Activate or pause rules (turn on or off).
*   [Edit](/firewall/cf-dashboard/create-edit-delete-rules/#edit-rule) rules.
*   [Delete](/firewall/cf-dashboard/create-edit-delete-rules/#delete-rule) rules.
