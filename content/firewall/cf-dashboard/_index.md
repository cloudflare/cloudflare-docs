# Manage firewall rules in the Cloudflare dashboard

To configure firewall rules in the Cloudflare dashboard, open **Firewall rules** in **Security** > **WAF**.

As depicted in the image below, the **Firewall rules** dashboard interface lets you:

* View the list of existing rules, both enabled and disabled.
* [Create, edit, and delete](/firewall/cf-dashboard/create-edit-delete-rules/) firewall rules.
* Enable or disable rules.
* Search and filter the list of existing rules.
* Reorder firewall rules when using [list ordering](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/order-priority/#managing-rule-evaluation-by-list-order).
