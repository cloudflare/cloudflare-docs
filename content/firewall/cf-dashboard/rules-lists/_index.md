# Use IP Lists

IP Lists allow you to create a group of IP addresses and refer to them collectively, by name, in your firewall rule expressions. For an introduction, refer to [IP Lists](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/rules-lists/).

## Access the Lists interface

IP Lists are stored at the account level. To access the **Lists** interface:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
1. Navigate to **Manage Account** > **Configurations** > **Lists**.

The **Lists** user interface displays.

Creating an IP List involves two steps:

1. [Create an IP List](/firewall/cf-dashboard/rules-lists/manage-lists/#create-an-ip-list).
1. [Add IP addresses to the list](/firewall/cf-dashboard/rules-lists/manage-items/#add-items-to-a-list).
