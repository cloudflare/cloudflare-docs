# Cloudflare Firewall Rules

Cloudflare Firewall Rules allows you to create rules that inspect incoming traffic and block, challenge, log, or allow specific requests.

## Main features

* **Rule-based protection**: Use pre-defined rulesets provided by Cloudflare, or define your own firewall rules. Create rules in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.
* **Complex custom rules**: Each rule's expression can reference multiple fields from all the available HTTP request parameters and fields, allowing you to create complex rules.

## Availability

Cloudflare Firewall Rules is available to all customers. However, the number of active firewall rules you can have and support for the *Log* action and regular expressions depend on your Cloudflare plan.

This table outlines the Firewall Rules features and entitlements available with each customer plan:
