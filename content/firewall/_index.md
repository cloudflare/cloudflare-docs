# Cloudflare Firewall Rules

Firewall Rules allow users to create rules that inspect incoming traffic and block, challenge, log, or allow specific requests.

## Main features

*   **Rule-based protection**: Use pre-defined rulesets provided by Cloudflare, or define your own Firewall Rules, including rules that perform rate limiting. Create rules in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.
*   **Complex custom rules**: Each rule's expression can reference multiple fields from all the available HTTP request parameters and fields, allowing you to create complex rules.

## Availability

Firewall Rules are available to customers on all Cloudflare plans.
