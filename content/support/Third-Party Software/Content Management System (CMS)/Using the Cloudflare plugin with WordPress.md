# Using the Cloudflare plugin with WordPress



## Overview

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) [](https://wordpress.com/)is a free and open-source content management system. Many WordPress sites use Cloudflare to increase site speed with our [free CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn) and protect site resources with our [security features](https://www.cloudflare.com/security/).

After [creating a Cloudflare account and adding a website](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Step-2-Create-a-CloudFlare-account-and-add-a-website), using Cloudflare with WordPress requires installing the Cloudflare plugin and configuring security and performance settings.

## Before getting started

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
The [Automatic Platform Optimization
(APO)](https://www.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/wordpress/)
feature requires that you be on a [Full
Setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/)
using Cloudflare nameservers.
{{</Aside>}}

Before adding your WordPress site to Cloudflare,

-   [Create a Cloudflare account](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Step-2-Create-a-CloudFlare-account-and-add-a-website). You can also learn more about how to get started with Cloudflare in our [Cloudflare 101](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/sections/200820158-Cloudflare-101) documentation.
-   If you self-host an Apache server, download [mod\_remoteip](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170786) to ensure that your IP address is logged correctly in both Apache logs and web applications.
-   Add all [Cloudflare IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) to an allowlist to avoid rate-limiting or blocking.

## Removing Plugin

In the event you cannot go back into your _**wp-admin**_ area, in order to recover access, please perform any of the following:

#### Manual delete

-   If you can access your wp-admin area, disable the Cloudflare plugin and/or upgrade it to **v3.8.2**
-   If not, ssh into your server and delete the plugin directory, located at **_../wp-content/plugins/cloudflare_**, after which you can reinstall your plugin and your settings will be preserved.
-   Restore a website backup from your hosting provider dashboard

#### Delete the plugin from the hosting provider “file manager” from inside your cPanel (Plesk)

-   Path to navigate to the plugin inside your FTP folders is: **wp-content -> plugins -> cloudflare**

Also as of WordPress 5.2, if WordPress is able to send emails, on a critical error, it will send the site owner a link to recovery mode which disables all plugins.
