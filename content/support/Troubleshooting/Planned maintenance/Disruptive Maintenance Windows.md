# Disruptive Maintenance Windows



## Scheduled Maintenance Windows

Maintenances will be published on the status page using a _calendar_ that is updated on a daily basis.

During these maintenance windows, customers may experience a slight increase in latency to the edge location which is under maintenance.

{{<Aside type="tip">}}
All dates in the calendar are in UTC Timezone.
