# Contacting Cloudflare Support

## Guidelines for contacting Cloudflare support

Cloudflare Support _cannot_ perform the following actions:

-   Make configuration or account changes on a customer’s behalf
-   Provide sensitive account info over the phone
-   Troubleshoot or answer questions about domains not associated with the Cloudflare account email address used to contact support

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

card numbers, private keys, or API keys with Cloudflare.

Before notifying Cloudflare of an issue with your site, refer to the [Cloudflare Status Page](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/). If reporting issues with your site, ensure to provide adequate details in the support ticket _(refer to [Getting help with an issue](#getting-help-with-an-issue) for more information)_.

## Verifying your identity

_(For Enterprise Emergency Phone Support)_

For account security, you must verify your identity and account ownership in the Cloudflare dashboard before discussing account settings and sensitive details with Cloudflare Support. There are two verification options:

-   a single-use token that automatically refreshes every thirty (30) seconds, or
-   an [authenticator app token](/support/account-management-billing/account-privacy-and-security/securing-user-access-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/#configure-totp-mobile-app-authentication-for-two-factor-cloudflare-login) on your mobile device.

### Authenticating your account

1\. Log into your Cloudflare account.

2\. In the upper right corner of the Cloudflare dashboard, click **Support** and select **Contact Support**.
