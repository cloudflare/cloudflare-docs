Once it loads, the Account Analytics app displays a collection of categorized charts with aggregated metrics for your account.  To understand the various metrics available, refer to _Review your account metrics_ below.

## Review your account metrics

This section outlines the aggregated metrics under each category.  Before reviewing your metrics, let’s define a couple of concepts used in some panels:

-   _Rate_ -  Reflects the ratio between the amount for a specific data category and the total.
-   _Bandwidth_ - Refers to the number of bytes sent from the Cloudflare edge network to the requesting client.

Also, note that:

-   To filter metrics for a specific time period, use the dropdown in the top right.
-   Most metrics are grouped into panels representing different aspects of the underlying data.

### Summary of metrics

Below is a brief description of the major elements comprising the metrics available.
