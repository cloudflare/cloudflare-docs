# We can't locate the dashboard account associated with your sign-on information

We are making some improvements to our support experience. This could be causing a temporary issue linking your [dashboard account](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and your Cloudflare [Help Center My Activities sign-on information](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/requests).

## Accounts with paid services

If you have an account with paid services:

1. Open a case with us through our [support portal](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/support).
2. Choose **Account** > **Support Platform** > **Other**.
3. For subject, enter “Can’t access Cloudflare Help Center My Activities.”

This process will allow us to link your account inside our new support system.

## Free accounts

If you are a free account customer, you do not have access to this feature, but you can get assistance in many other ways:

- By joining the conversation in our [Community forums](https://community.cloudflare.com/).
- By joining our [Discord server](https://discord.cloudflare.com/).
- By checking out our [Documentation](/).
- By visiting the [Cloudflare Help Center](https://support.cloudflare.com/). There you will find our most frequently asked questions, steps to issue resolution, and more.
