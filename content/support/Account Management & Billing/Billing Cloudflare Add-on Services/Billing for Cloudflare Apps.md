# Billing for Cloudflare Apps

## Overview

Many apps within Cloudflare Apps are free and you will not be billed for them.

All paid apps within Cloudflare Apps are billed monthly. You are charged monthly for each domain for which you have purchased and installed an app.

When you remove an app you are not refunded for the remainder of the final month, but can reinstall the app at any time during that period to resume using it.
