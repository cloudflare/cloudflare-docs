# Understanding SameSite cookie interaction with Cloudflare



## Overview

[Google Chrome’s SameSite cookie](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site) changes how Google Chrome handles the SameSite control. Google enforces SameSite to protect against marketing cookies that track users and Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) that allows attackers to steal or manipulate your cookies.  

The SameSite cookie has 3 different modes:

-   **Strict**: Cookies are created by the first-party (the visited domain). For example, a first-party cookie is set by Cloudflare when visiting Cloudflare.com.
-   **Lax**: Cookies are only sent to the domain apex (e.g. _\*.foo.com_).  For example, if someone (_blog.naughty.com_) hotlinked an image (_img.foo.com/bar.png_), the client doesn’t send a cookie to _img.foo.com_ since it is neither the first-party nor apex context.
-   **None**: Cookies are sent with all requests.

SameSite settings for [Cloudflare cookies](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170156) include:

| Cloudflare Cookie | SameSite Setting | HTTPS Only |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \_\_cf\_bm | SameSite=None; Secure | Yes |
| cf\_clearance | SameSite=None; Secure | Yes |
| \_\_cflb | SameSite=Lax | No |

When configuring SameSite attributes on session affinity cookies, it is recommended that you set the values. The value `Auto` is translated to `Lax` if **Always Use HTTPS** is enabled, or `None` if **Always Use HTTPS** is disabled. When using the value `None`, the secure attribute cannot be set to `Never`.

- Default value: `Auto`
- Valid values: `Auto`, `Lax`, `None`, `Script`.

## Known issues with SameSite and cf_clearance cookies

When a visitor solves a [challenge](/firewall/cf-firewall-rules/cloudflare-challenges/) presented due to a [WAF custom rule](/waf/custom-rules/) or an [IP Access rule](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/), a `cf_clearance` cookie is set in the client browser. The `cf_clearance` cookie has a default lifetime of 30 minutes, which you can configure via [Challenge Passage](/waf/tools/challenge-passage/).

Cloudflare uses `SameSite=None` in the `cf_clearance` cookie so that visitor requests from different hostnames are not met with subsequent challenges or errors. When `SameSite=None` is used, it must be set in conjunction with the `Secure` flag.

Using the `Secure` flag requires sending the cookie via an HTTPS connection. If you use HTTP on any part of your website, the `cf_clearance` cookie defaults to `SameSite=Lax`, which may cause your website not to function properly. To resolve the issue, move your website traffic to HTTPS. Cloudflare offers two features to assist:

-   [Always Use HTTPS](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https)
