# I was visiting another website and saw a Cloudflare error page

## Cloudflare error pages

If you saw a Cloudflare error page on another site, it's not your fault.

Try checking the page again in a few minutes.

If you are still seeing an error page, it's likely an issue with the web server you were trying to reach.

These problems generally are not caused by Cloudflare.
