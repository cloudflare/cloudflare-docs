# Choosing between Cloudflare and Yunjiasu



## Overview

There are many benefits to both services in Cloudflare’s partnership with Baidu.

You should sign up for [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans) if:

1.  A meaningful portion of your audience is _outside_ of mainland China.
2.  You would like to use a service (including support) offered in English.
3.  You do not have an [ICP license](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/209714777-ICP-FAQ).
4.  You require HTTPS.

You should choose the [Yunjiasu](http://su.baidu.com/) service if:

1.  Your user base is located primarily in mainland China.
2.  You prefer a service (including support) offered in the Chinese language.
3.  You have an [ICP license](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/209714777-ICP-FAQ).
4.  Your domain is HTTP-only.

As the China Network is a joint offering, a domain can only be active through one provider at a time. If the domain is currently on Cloudflare, you need to remove the domain from your Cloudflare account, [sign up](http://su.baidu.com/) for a Yunjiasu account, and add the domain to your Yunjiasu account. The same steps are true if you’re switching from Yunjiasu to Cloudflare.

You can be a user of both Cloudflare and Yunjiasu if you choose to set up different domains between the two services.
