# Understanding and configuring Cloudflare Page Rules (Page Rules Tutorial)



## Overview

You can define a page rule to trigger one or more actions whenever a certain URL pattern is matched. Page Rules are available in the **Rules** app, in the **Page Rules** tab.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Page Rules require a
\"[proxied](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records)\"
DNS record for your page rule to work. Page Rules won\'t apply to
hostnames that don\'t exist in DNS or aren\'t being directed to
Cloudflare.
{{</Aside>}}

The default number of allowed page rules depends on the domain plan as shown below.

{{<feature-table id="rules.page_rules">}}

You can [purchase additional rules](https://www.cloudflare.com/features-page-rules/) (up to a maximum of 100) for domains in the Free, Lite, Pro, Pro Plus, and Business plans.

___

## Before getting started

It is important to understand two basic Page Rules behaviors:

-   Only the highest priority matching page rule takes effect on a request.
-   Page rules are prioritized in descending order in the Cloudflare dashboard, with the highest priority rule at the top.

{{<Aside type="tip">}}
Cloudflare recommends ordering your rules from most specific to least
specific.
{{</Aside>}}

A page rule matches a URL pattern based on the following format (comprised of five segments): <scheme>://<hostname><:port>/<path>?<query\_string>

An example URL with these four segments looks like:

```
https://www.example.com:443/image.png?parameter1=value1
```

The _scheme_ and _port_ segments are optional. If omitted, _scheme_ matches both _http://_ and _https://_ protocols. If no _port_ is specified, the rule will match all ports.

Finally, you can disable a page rule at any time. While a rule is disabled, actions won’t trigger, but the rule still appears in the **Rules** app in the **Page Rules** tab, is editable, and counts against the number of rules allowed for your domain. The _Save as Draft_ option creates a page rule that is disabled by default.

___

## Create a page rule

The steps to create a page rule are:

1.  Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.
2.  Select the domain where you want to add the page rule.
3.  Click the **Rules** app.
4.  In the **Page Rules** tab**,** click **Create Page Rule**. The _Create Page Rule for <your domain>_ dialog opens.
5.  Under **If the URL matches**, enter the URL or URL pattern that should match the rule. [_Learn more about wildcard matching_](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427-Understanding-and-Configuring-Cloudflare-Page-Rules-Page-Rules-Tutorial-#h_6N5SySNYCjYUUnCKnC1Ea6)
6.  Next, under **Then the settings are:** click **+ Add a Setting** and select the desired setting from the dropdown. You can include more than one setting per rule. Learn more about settings in the [summary below](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427-Understanding-and-Configuring-Cloudflare-Page-Rules-Page-Rules-Tutorial-#h_18YTlvNlZET4Poljeih3TJ).
7.  In the **Order** dropdown, specify the desired order: _First, Last_ or _Custom_.
8.  To save, click one of the following options:
    -   **Save as Draft** to save the rule and leave it disabled.
    -   **Save and Deploy** to save the rule and enable it immediately.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
**Note:** We do not support non-ASCII characters (e.g. punycode/unicode
domain) in Page Rules. Instead, you could URL-encode the string using
[Punycode converter](https://www.punycoder.com/ "Punycode converter"),
for example, and this will work.
{{</Aside>}}

{{<Aside type="tip">}}
Consult [Recommended Page Rules to
Consider](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/224509547 "Recommended Page Rules to Consider")
for ideas about the types of page rules you can create.
{{</Aside>}}

___

## Edit a page rule

To modify an existing rule:

1.  Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.
2.  Select the domain where you want to edit your page rule.
3.  Click the **Rules** app.
4.  In the **Page Rules** tab, locate the rule to edit.
5.  Proceed to make the necessary changes, as follows:
    -   To enable or disable a rule, click the **On/Off** toggle.
    -   To modify the URL pattern, settings, and order, click the **Edit** button (wrench icon). In the dialog, enter the information you’d like to change.
    -   To remove a rule, click the **Delete** button (x icon) and confirm by clicking **OK** in the **Confirm** dialog.

___

## Understand wildcard matching and referencing

You can use the asterisk (\*) in any URL segment to match certain patterns. For example,

```
example.com/t*st
```

Would match:

```
example.com/test
example.com/toast
example.com/trust
```

_example.com/foo/\*_ does not match example.com/foo.  However, _example.com/foo\*_ does.

### Helpful tips

-   To match both _http_ and _https_, just write _example.com_. It is not necessary to write _\*example.com_.
-   To match every page on a domain, write _example.com/\*_. Just writing _example.com_ won’t work.
-   To match every page on a domain and it's subdomains, write \*_example.com/\*_. Just writing _example.com_ won’t work.
-   A wildcard (\*) in a Page Rule URL will match even if no characters are present, and may include any part of the URL, including the query string.

### Referencing wildcard matches

You can reference a matched wildcard later using the _$X_ syntax. _X_ indicates the index of a glob pattern. As such, $1 represents the first wildcard match, $2 the second wildcard match, and so on.

This is specifically useful with the _Forwarding URL_ setting. For example:

You could forward:

```
http://*.example.com/*
```

to:

```
http://example.com/images/$1/$2.jpg
```

This rule would match:

```
http://cloud.example.com/flare.jpg
```

which ends up being forwarded to:

```
http://example.com/images/cloud/flare.jpg
```

To use a literal _$_ character in the forwarding URL, escape it by adding a backslash (\\) in front: _\\$_.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Avoid creating a redirect where the domain points to itself as the
destination. This can cause an infinite redirect error and your site
cannot be served to visitors.

## Summary of Page Rules Settings

Settings control the action Cloudflare takes once a request matches the URL pattern defined in a page rule. You can use settings to enable and disable multiple Cloudflare features across several of the dashboard apps. Note that:

-   Some settings require a Pro, Business or Enterprise domain plan.
-   You can specify more than one setting to apply when the rule triggers.

Below is the full list of settings available, presented in the order that they appear in the **Cloudflare Page Rules** UI.

| **Setting** | **Description** | **Plans** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Always Use HTTPS |  Turn on or off the **[Always Use HTTPS](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https)** feature of the **Edge Certificates** tab in the **Cloudflare SSL/TLS** app. If enabled, any _http://_ URL is converted to _https://_ through a 301 redirect.<br/>If this option does not appear, you do not have an active **Edge Certificate**. | All |
| Auto Minify | Indicate which file extensions to minify automatically. [Learn more](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200168196). | All |
| Automatic HTTPS Rewrites | Turn on or off the **Cloudflare Automatic HTTPS Rewrites** feature of the **Edge Certificates** tab in **Cloudflare SSL/TLS** app. [Learn more](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/automatic-https-rewrites). | All |
| Browser Cache TTL | Control how long resources cached by client browsers remain valid. The Cloudflare UI and API both prohibit setting **Browser Cache TTL** to _0_ for non-Enterprise domains. [Learn more](/cache/about/edge-browser-cache-ttl). | All |
| Browser Integrity Check | Inspect the visitor's browser for headers commonly associated with spammers and certain bots. [Learn more](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200170086). | All |
| Bypass Cache on Cookie | Bypass Cache and fetch resources from the origin server if a regular expression matches against a cookie name present in the request.<br/>If you add both this setting and the _Cache On Cookie_ setting to the same page rule, _Cache On Cookie_ takes precedence over _Bypass Cache on Cookie_.<br/>_Refer to the Additional details below to learn about limited regular expression support._ | Business and Enterprise |
| Cache By Device Type | Separate cached content based on the visitor’s device type. [Learn more.](/cache/how-to/create-page-rules#cache-by-device-type-enterprise-only) | Enterprise |
| Cache Deception Armor | Protect from web cache deception attacks while still allowing static assets to be cached. This setting verifies that the URL's extension matches the returned _Content-Type_. [Learn more.](/cache/about/cache-deception-armor)| All |
| Cache Key | Also referred to as _Custom Cache Key_.<br/>Control specifically what variables to include when deciding which resources to cache. This allows customers to determine what to cache based on something other than just the URL. [Learn more](/cache/about/cache-keys). | Enterprise |
| Cache Level | Apply custom caching based on the option selected:<br/>**Bypass** \- Cloudflare does not cache.<br/>**No Query String** - Delivers resources from cache when there is no query string.<br/>**Ignore Query String** \- Delivers the same resource to everyone independent of the query string.<br/>**Standard -** Caches all static content that has a query string.<br/>**Cache Everything** \-  Treats all content as static and caches all file types beyond the [Cloudflare default cached content](/cache/about/default-cache-behavior#default-cached-file-extensions).  Respects cache headers from the origin web server unless **Edge Cache TTL** is also set in the Page Rule. When combined with an **Edge Cache TTL** > _0_, **Cache Everything** removes cookies from the origin web server response. | All |
| Cache on Cookie | Apply the _Cache Everything_ option (_Cache Level_ setting) based on a regular expression match against a cookie name.<br/>If you add both this setting and _Bypass Cache on Cookie_ to the same page rule, _Cache On Cookie_ takes precedence over _Bypass Cache on Cookie_. |  Business and above |
| Cache TTL by Status Code | Enterprise customers can set cache time-to-live (TTL) based on the response status from the origin web server. Cache TTL refers to the duration of a resource in the Cloudflare network before being marked as stale or discarded from cache. Status codes are returned by a resource’s origin.   Setting cache TTL based on response status overrides the default cache behavior (standard caching) for static files and overrides cache instructions sent by the origin web server. To cache non-static assets, set a Cache Level of Cache Everything using a Page Rule . Setting no-store Cache-Control or a low TTL (using max-age/s-maxage) increases requests to origin web servers and decreases performance. [Learn more](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043842472-Configuring-cache-TTL-by-status-code). | Enterprise |

## Known Issues

**Page Rule configuration issue leading to "****_Error 500 (Internal server error)_****"**

**Root cause**: This may be due to a configuration issue on a Page Rule. When creating a Page Rule that uses two wildcards, like a _Forwarding URL_ rule, it is possible to create a rule that mentions the second wildcard with the $2 placeholder. Refer to the example below:

![Example Page Rule configuration with two wildcards. The forwarding URL contains a $2 placeholder, which will be replaced with the content matched by the second ](/support/static/page-rule-create.png)

When updating the same rule, you can remove one of the wildcard in the **If the URL matches** field and save it. Refer to the example below:

![Incorrect Page Rule configuration with a single wildcard, but still using the $2 placeholder in the forwarding URL. This configuration causes ](/support/static/page-rule-update.png)

If you do so, the $2 placeholder reference a wildcard that does not exist anymore, and as such, an "_Error 500 (Internal server error)"_ is thrown when a URL triggers the page rule.

**Resolution**: Update the Page Rule and remove the reference _$2_ to the second wildcard. If there is only one wildcard, then only _$1_ can be used.

## Additional details

### Bypass Cache on Cookie setting

This setting is available to business and enterprise customers.

The **Bypass Cache on Cookie** setting supports basic regular expressions (regex) as follows:

-   A pipe operator (represented by |) to match multiple cookies using _OR_ boolean logic. For example, bypass=.\*_|PHPSESSID=.\*_ would bypass the cache if either a cookie called bypass or PHPSESSID were set, regardless of the cookie's value.
-   The wildcard operator (represented by .\*), such that a rule value of “t.\*st=” would match both a cookie called test and one called teeest.

Limitations include:

-   150 chars per cookie regex
-   12 wildcards per cookie regex
-   1 wildcard in between each | in the cookie regex

To learn how to configure **Bypass Cache on Cookie** with a variety of platforms, review these articles:

-   [Caching Anonymous Page Views with WordPress or WooCommerce](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/236166048)
-   [Caching Anonymous Page Views with Magento 1 and Magento 2](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/236168808)
-   [How do I cache static HTML?](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/202775670)

**Note:** If you add both this setting and the enterprise-only _Cache On Cookie_ setting to the same page rule, _Cache On Cookie_ takes precedence over _Bypass Cache on Cookie_.

### Zone name occurrences must end with a slash

When saving a Page Rule, Cloudflare will ensure that there is a slash after each occurrence of the current zone name in the **If the URL matches** field. For example, if the current zone name is `example.com`, then:

-   `example.com` will be saved as `example.com/`
-   `example.com/path/example.com` will be saved as `example.com/path/example.com/`

Note that `example.com/some-path/cloudflare.com` will be saved _without_ a final slash, since the zone name is not `cloudflare.com`.

### Network ports supported by Page Rules

If you specify a port in the **If the URL matches** field of a Page Rule, it must be one of the following:

-   One of the HTTP/HTTPS ports [compatible with Cloudflare’s proxy](/fundamentals/get-started/reference/network-ports/#network-ports-compatible-with-cloudflares-proxy).
-   A custom port of a [Cloudflare Spectrum](/spectrum/) HTTPS application.

### Using Page Rules with Workers

If the URL of the current request matches both a Page Rule and a [Workers custom route](/workers/platform/triggers/routes/), some Pages Rules settings will not be applied. For details on using Page Rules with Workers, refer to [Workers: Page Rules](/workers/platform/workers-with-page-rules/) in the developers documentation.
