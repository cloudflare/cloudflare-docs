We recommend that all Cloudflare user account holders enable 2FA to keep their accounts secure. 

2FA can only be enabled successfully on an account with a [verified email address](/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/verify-email-address/). If you do not verify your email address first, you may lock yourself out of your account.

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Super Administrators can turn on **2FA Enforcement** to require all
members to enable 2FA. If you are not a Super Administrator, you will be
forced to turn on 2FA prior to accepting the invitation to join a
Cloudflare account as a member. 
{{</Aside>}}

To enable two-factor authentication for your Cloudflare login:

1.  Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard.
2.  Under the **My Profile** dropdown, select **My Profile**.
3.  Select the **Authentication** tab. 
4.  Select **Manage** in the Two-Factor Authentication card.
5.  Configure either a TOTP mobile app or a security key to enable 2FA on your account.
