# Reporting bugs or feature requests for Cloudflare Apps



## Overview

First, we recommend reaching out to the App's support contact. You can find the support contact on the right side of the App's page. For example, here is [Chatra's Page](https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/chatra), where the support contact is listed under the Developer contact in a grey box below the **Preview** button.

Another contact to share your feedback and see if other's have had similar ideas/issues is the Cloudflare [community site for Apps](https://community.cloudflare.com/c/apps).
