# Managing Cloudflare Apps

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

**Cloudflare Apps is deprecated and will be discontinued August 31, 2024.** 

After August 31, 2024, we will be automatically uninstalling installed apps from your Cloudflare zone(s). This will not impact Cloudflare's first-party services running on your zones.

**The [Datadome app](https://datadome.co/) is the only exception to this.** 

We understand that uninstalling apps might be disruptive. To address any potential issues, please review and [remove](/support/more-dashboard-apps/cloudflare-apps/removing-cloudflare-apps/) apps installed on your zones through the Cloudflare dashboard.

For any questions about the deprecation or support requests, reach out to apps-marketplace-support[at]cloudflare.com. 

We will be creating a new Apps experience. If youâ€™re interested, leave us feedback and sign up [here](https://forms.gle/sHxVMoQzZpTtuJak9).

## Overview

To find and manage Apps:

1.  Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard.](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login)
2.  Select your account and website.
3.  Go to **Apps**.

To view apps currently installed on your site, visit the **Installed Apps** tab.

Click "Edit Install" on any app to reenter the Live Preview and make any necessary changes. If you would like to remove the app from your site, click "Uninstall" at the bottom of the preview page.

Removing a paid app from your site will automatically cancel its subscription at the end of the current monthly billing period.
