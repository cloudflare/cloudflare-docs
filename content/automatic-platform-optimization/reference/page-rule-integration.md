# Page Rule integration with APO

The following Page rules can control APO. Any changes to Caching page rules require purging the cache for the changes to take effect.

- **Cache Level: Bypass** — APO bypasses pages with response header `cf-apo-via: origin,page-rules`

- **Cache Level: Ignore Query String** — APO ignores all query strings when serving from Cache.

- **Cache Level: Cache Everything** — APO caches pages with all query strings.

  {{<Aside type="warning">}}

Automatic page purge via the WordPress plugin won’t clean all cached pages, only pages without query strings. Cached responses will be returned even with request header `cache-control: no-cache`.

    {{</Aside>}}

- **Bypass Cache on Cookie (Business and Enterprise plans only)** — APO applies custom bypass cookies in addition to the default list.

- **Edge Cache TTL** — APO applies custom Edge TTL instead of 30 days. This page rule is helpful for pages that can generate Captchas or nonces.

- **Browser Cache TTL** — APO applies custom Browser TTL.

- `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` – Enables users to have detailed control over cache TTLs without using a page rule. For more information on the `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` headers, refer to [CDN-Cache-Control](/cache/about/cdn-cache-control/).
