# Pricing

{{<Aside>}}
Workers AI is currently in Open Beta and is **not recommended for production data and traffic**, and pricing is subject to change
{{</Aside>}}

Although we are not presently billing, we want to provide insight into what we expect our pricing structure to look like, allowing for better planning and anticipating the costs associated with Workers AI.

We'll be offering two ways to run Workers AI:

- **Regular Twitch Neurons (RTN)** - running wherever there's capacity at $0.01 / 1k neurons

- **Fast Twitch Neurons (FTN)** - running at nearest user location at $0.125 / 1k neurons
