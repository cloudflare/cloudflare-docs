# Choose the Right Text Generation Model

A great way to explore the models that are available to you on [Workers AI](/workers-ai) is to use a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

You can [download the Workers AI Text Generation Exploration notebook](/workers-ai/static/documentation/notebooks/text-generation-model-exploration.ipynb) or view the embedded notebook below.

## How to Choose The Right Text Generation Model

Models come in different shapes and sizes, and choosing the right one for the task, can cause analysis paralysis.

The good news is that on the [Workers AI Text Generation](/workers-ai/models/#text-generation) interface is always the same, no matter which model you choose.

In an effort to aid you in your journey of finding the right model, this notebook will help you get to know your options in a speed dating type of scenario.

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install requests python-dotenv
```

    Requirement already satisfied: requests in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (2.31.0)
    Requirement already satisfied: python-dotenv in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (1.0.1)
    Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (3.3.2)
    Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (3.6)
    Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (2.1.0)
    Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (2023.11.17)

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass
from timeit import default_timer as timer

from IPython.display import display, Image, Markdown, Audio

import requests
```

```python
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv
```

### Configuring your environment

To use the API you'll need your [Cloudflare Account ID](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (head to Workers & Pages > Overview > Account details > Account ID) and a [Workers AI enabled API Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

If you want to add these files to your environment, you can create a new file named `.env`

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" in os.environ:
    api_token = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"]
else:
    api_token = getpass("Enter you Cloudflare API Token")
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" in os.environ:
    account_id = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"]
else:
    account_id = getpass("Enter your account id")
```

```python
# Given a set of models and questions, display in the cell each response to the question, from each model
# Include full completion timing
def speed_date(models, questions):
    for model in models:
        display(Markdown(f"---\n #### {model}"))
        for question in questions:
            quoted_question = "\n".join(f"> {line}" for line in question.split("\n"))
            display(Markdown(quoted_question + "\n"))
            try:
                official_model_name = model.split("/")[-1]
                start = timer()
                response = requests.post(
                    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",

                        {"role": "user", "content": question}
                    ]}
                )
                elapsed = timer() - start
                inference = response.json()
                display(Markdown(inference["result"]["response"]))
                display(Markdown(f"_Generated in *{elapsed:.2f}* seconds_"))
            except Exception as ex:
                print("uh oh")
                print(ex)
                print(inference)

        display(Markdown("\n\n---"))
```

### Information Retrieval and Summarization

Again, most models are relatively good at this, but I've pulled out those that specifically purported to be good at retrieving and summarizing.

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a summary of "Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning" by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger, and Mark A. McDaniel, published in 2014:

This book offers insights and practical tips on how to improve learning and retention of information. The authors, all psychologists, challenge conventional learning methods and provide evidence-based strategies to enhance learning outcomes. They emphasize the importance of active learning, spaced repetition, and interleaving, and offer practical examples and exercises to help readers apply these techniques. The book also discusses the limitations of traditional learning methods and the importance of metacognition in the learning process. Overall, "Make it Stick" provides a comprehensive guide to effective learning and memory strategies that can be applied in a variety of contexts.

How about "Echo and Echo"? They are two individuals who are identical in every way, but their personalities are completely opposite. Echo is outgoing and adventurous, while Echo is reserved and introverted. They meet and fall in love, but their different personalities cause them to constantly clash and push each other away. Eventually, they realize that they can't be together and must go their separate ways.

> I'm writing a fictional story that is set in the near future. It's a love story about star crossed lovers. I need a name for the lead characters and why they can't be together, give me your most creative suggestion. Only one please.

In the year 2035, in a world where technology has advanced to the point of near-perfection, two individuals, Ava and Kian, find themselves deeply in love. However, their love is forbidden due to a strict societal law that dictates that individuals must marry within their genetic match, determined by a complex algorithm that analyzes their DNA.

Ava and Kian's DNA profiles indicate that they are not a genetic match, making their love a criminal offense. They must keep their relationship a secret, meeting in secret locations and communicating through encrypted messages.

Their love is not just forbidden, but also dangerous. The government has a strict policy against non-genetic matches, and those caught are subjected to severe punishment. Ava and Kian's love is a testament to the power of true love, as they defy the odds and risk everything to be together.

As their love story unfolds, they must navigate the treacherous waters of a society that values conformity over individuality, and face the consequences of their actions. Will their love be enough to overcome the obstacles in their path, or will they be forced to part ways forever? Only time

Ah, a love story set in the near future, how intriguing! I've got just the name for your star-crossed lovers. How about "Echo and Nova"?

Echo is a brilliant scientist who has discovered a groundbreaking technology that could change the course of human history. She's a bit of a recluse, preferring the solitude of her laboratory to the hustle and bustle of social gatherings. Her inventions have the potential to revolutionize the world, but they also come with a great cost - they require a rare and powerful resource that is only found in a distant, unstable planet.

Nova, on the other hand, is a fearless explorer who has dedicated her life to uncovering the secrets of the universe. She's charismatic, fearless, and has a natural talent for leadership. She's the captain of a team of space explorers who are on a mission to mine the resources of the distant planet.

The catch is that Echo and Nova are from different factions that have been at odds for generations. Echo's inventions have the potential to give her fa

### Text Classification

Workers AI provides models that are specific for [Text Classification](/workers-ai/models/#text-classification), but since these models, specifically called it out, we should let them show off their skills.

```python
proud_classifiers = [
    "@hf/thebloke/openhermes-2.5-mistral-7b-awq",
    "@hf/thebloke/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-awq"
]

sentiment_prompt_template = """
Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive
Text: {text}
Sentiment: """

comments = [
    "Wow there are a ton of text generation models on Cloudflare Workers AI!",
    "Sometimes choosing things is hard",
    "I cannot wait to build! üí™üöÄ",
    "The challenging thing about using native open source models is that they are all configured a little differently",
    "Thankfully Cloudflare Workers AI has made a standard interface that lets me get reliable, low-latency inference. So quick too!"
]

sentiment_questions = [sentiment_prompt_template.format(text=comment) for comment in comments]
