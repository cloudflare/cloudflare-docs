# Create Bulk Redirects in the dashboard

To create Bulk Redirects in the Cloudflare dashboard you must:

1. Create a Bulk Redirect List with one or more URL redirects.
2. Create a Bulk Redirect Rule to enable the URL redirects in the list.

## 1. Create a Bulk Redirect List

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2. Go to Account Home > **Bulk Redirects**.
3. In the **Bulk Redirect Lists** card, select **Create Bulk Redirect List**.
4. Enter a list name and description, and select **Next**.

5. You can import a CSV file containing several URL redirects or enter URL redirects one at a time in the dashboard.

    <details>
    <summary>Import a CSV file</summary>
    <div>

    1\. Drag and drop a CSV file containing URL redirects or select **browse** and select a CSV file. For more information on the file format, refer to [CSV file format](/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/reference/csv-file-format/).

    2\. The dashboard will display the URL redirects that were successfully imported from the file. You can manually adjust the displayed records or add/remove URL redirects before proceeding.

    3\. Select **Next**.

    </div>
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Add URL redirects manually</summary>
    <div>

    1\. Select **Or, manually add URL redirects**.

    2\. Enter the URL redirects you wish to add to the list. You must enter at least the following three fields: **Source URL**, **Target URL**, and **Status**. To set additional options, expand **Edit Parameters**.

    3\. Add more URL redirects, if required.

    4\. Select **Next**.

    </div>
    </details>

6. Review and edit the URL redirects you imported or created, and select **Next**.
7. Select **Continue to Redirect Rules** to go to the rule creation page, and follow the instructions in the next section. You must create a Bulk Redirect Rule to enable the URL redirects you defined.
