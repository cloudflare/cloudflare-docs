{{<beta>}}Enable DMARC Management{{</beta>}}

You need to enable DMARC Management to allow Cloudflare to process DMARC reports on your behalf. Before enabling DMARC Management, note that it does not support subdomains. You can only use it with your primary domain on [each zone](/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/accounts-and-zones/) of your Cloudflare account.

{{<Aside type="warning" header="A warning on DMARC Management and SPF records">}}
DMARC Management does not support actions on SPF records when your zone has a CNAME record that points to a different domain. Changing the SPF record would make DMARC rules invalid, as Cloudflare cannot change other DNS records to reflect your updates.

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **DMARC Management**.
3. Select **Enable DMARC Managment**.
4. DMARC Management will scan your zone for DMARC records. 

    1. If no record is found, Cloudflare will automatically invite you to add one that you can edit later. Select **Add** to continue.
    2. If there is a DMARC record in your zone, Cloudflare will add another `rua` entry to it. This additional `rua` tag has a Cloudflare email address and is needed for Cloudflare to be able to start processing DMARC reports on your behalf. Select **Next** to continue.

DMARC Management (beta) is now active. However, it may take up to 24 hours to receive your first DMARC report and to display this information in DMARC Management.

## Email security records

After the reports being generated, you check the Email security records:
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **DMARC Management**.
3. Click on the option **View Records**

The Sender Policy Framework (or SPF) allows you to specify all IP addresses and hostnames that are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. If you donâ€™t configure SPF on your domain your email may be blocked or marked as spam by email receivers.

After create the SPF records you can also use the option **Inspect** to check if they meet the requirements of a maximum of 10 DNS lookups. If this limit is exceeded, the receiving email server may not accept the SPF record. This puts your emails at risk of being rejected or marked as spam.
