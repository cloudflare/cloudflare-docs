## Create security records

To set up email security records:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Email** > **DMARC Management**.
3. In **Email record overview**, select **View records**.
4. Use the available options to set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. This page will also list any previous records you might already have in your account.

## Edit or delete records
