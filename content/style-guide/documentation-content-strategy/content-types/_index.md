# Content types

All new [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/) products should include the required content sections that are listed in the following table. The other sections are available depending on what information users need to successfully use the product.

Templates for each content type are also available in our [Cloudflare-docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/tree/production/static/_templates).
