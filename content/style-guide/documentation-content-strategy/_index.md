# Developer documentation content strategy

Content strategy means using the right tool for the job. Cloudflare's documentation will provide the most effective content types that serve a customer-focused purpose. Adoption of this content strategy will be impacted by product releases, resourcing, and company goals.

The purpose of Cloudflare's developer documentation content strategy is to:

+ Create and document standard templates to streamline content creation
+ Document specific content types to help identify customers specific needs
+ Enable life cycle management in an effort to maintain and optimize a smaller set of pages
+ Suggest easier navigation paths

Strategically speaking, the mission and guiding principles translate into the following initiatives:

+ Improve the entire ecosystem of customer-facing product content, placing major emphasis on consistency, quality, accuracy, and timeliness
+ Create a cohesive and compelling story around our products and their functionality
+ Develop content that increases product adoption, deflects support, and makes customers successful
+ Partner with various internal departments and stakeholders in creating and sustaining a rich, consistent content experience across all Cloudflare products
+ Devise new and better ways to give users the information they need, when and where they need it

## Purpose statements

For each purpose statement, the documentation team will define the approach to solve the content problem for a product.

This approach includes:

### Information architecture

+ Where content should live on the site
+ Linking strategy

### Content

+ What content is included and what is optional
+ How the content is written

## Content requirements

Content requirements help the contributor ensure they have answered the user question and have not lost the purpose of the content after moving to execution.
