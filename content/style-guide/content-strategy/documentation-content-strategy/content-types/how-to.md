## Structure

### Required components

[**Title**](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/titles/) - Short verb phrase in second-person imperative. Do not use gerund phrases. 

[**Steps**](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/) - Numbered steps that complete a task.

[**Next steps**](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/next-steps/) - What users should see as the end result of the steps and/or actionable next steps.

### Optional components

[**Context**](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/context/) - An introductory paragraph on the following steps and what they'll accomplish.

Provide context to the reader that is not in the section heading.

End with a colon or a period. Use a colon if it immediately precedes the steps. Use a period if there's more material (such as a note) between the context and the procedure.

Don't provide context for steps with a partial sentence that's completed by the numbered steps.
