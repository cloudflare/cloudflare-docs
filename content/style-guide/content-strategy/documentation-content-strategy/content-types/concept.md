## Structure

### Required components

+ [**Title**](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/titles/): Use "About" for concept pages that describe the functionality of your product. Otherwise, use a short noun phrase (feature name, functionality, Internet concept - Health checks, Status resource protection, CDN)
+ [**Context**](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/context/): Provide a brief description of why users should care about this information.
+ **Explanation**: Explain the page topic. Keep paragraphs short and concise to avoid large blocks of text. Feel free to use bulleted lists, notes, and headings for visual breaks.
