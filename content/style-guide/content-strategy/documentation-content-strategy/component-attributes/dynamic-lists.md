# Dynamic lists

## Definition

Dynamic lists automatically add or remove elements based on set criteria.

## Used in

When at all possible, Cloudflare seeks to avoid creating static representations of dynamic options.

## Structure

Potential examples include:

+ Exhaustive listing of fields
+ Replicating API content in developer docs
+ Maintaining lists of potential options in the UI (i.e., Alert types)
+ Verified Bots

The preferred approach would be speak more generally to the categories or specific, high-value fields.
