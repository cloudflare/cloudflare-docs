# URLs and domain names

When referring to a URL in text, do not use `http://` or `www` with a Cloudflare web address. Use `www` only when referring to URLs outside of Cloudflare. For example, use `cloudflare.com` when referring to [cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/), and `www.example.com` when referring to [www.example.com](https://www.example.com/).
