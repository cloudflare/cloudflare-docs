# URLS and domain names

When referring to a URL in text, do not use the `http://` or `www` with Cloudflare web address. Use the `www` only when referring to URLs outside of Cloudflare. When referring to [Cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/), use "[cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/)".
