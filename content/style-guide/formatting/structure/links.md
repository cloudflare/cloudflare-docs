# Links

Follow these guidelines for link text.

## Standard text

As much as possible, use text that follows one of these patterns:

- `For more information, refer to [<PAGE_TITLE>](LINK).`
- `To <DO_SOMETHING>, refer to [<SECTION_TITLE>](LINK).`

Do not use the following constructions:

- `Learn more about...`
- `To read more....`
- `For more information, refer the [Merge requests](LINK) page.`
- `For more information, refer the [Merge requests](LINK) documentation.`

## Descriptive link text

Use descriptive text for links, rather than words like `here` or `this page`.

For example, instead of:

- `For more information, refer to [this page](LINK).`
- `For more information, go [here](LINK).`

Use:

- `For more information, refer to [set up Cloudflare](LINK).`
