# UI elements

UI elements are the interactive parts we use to build the products. When describing UI elements in writing, we focus on what users need to do without focusing on the UI.

To clarify instructions for complex interfaces, you may need to identify elements by name.

| UI element                                                | Usage                                                                                | Example                                                                                          |

## Symbols in UI element names

### Icons or non-alphabetic characters

Button names and the labels of other UI elements may include icons or symbols that are not alphabetical or numerical. For example, a button named **+ Add element** starts with a plus sign. When writing these names or labels in procedural instructions, do not include these symbols. They are usually redundant and can be safely removed.

If an element has no text other than the symbol (for example, just `+`), you can keep the symbol in the instructions. This especially applies to instructions in UIs of third-party products.

### Ellipses

An ellipsis is a set of three dots (`...`) that might be used as a variable or wildcard. For example, a **Save As...** menu item might display a dialog box where you can save a file in different places. If you refer to a menu item or button that has ellipses, do not include the ellipsis. Always leave it out. In text, ellipses can be distracting.
