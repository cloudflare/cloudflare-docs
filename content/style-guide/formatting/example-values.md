## IPv4 ranges

According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), there are specific [IPv4 ranges used for documentation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5737/):

Examples:

+ `192.0.2.0/24`.
+ `198.51.100.0/24`.
+ `203.0.113.0/24`.

These IP addresses are reserved and will not take anyone to live origins.
