## URLS and Domain Names

When referring to a URL in text, do not use the *http://* or *www* with Cloudflare web address. Use the *www* only when referring to URLs outside of Cloudflare. When referring to [Cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/), use *at [cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/)*.
