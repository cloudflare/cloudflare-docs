# Dates and Times

## Product Content

To account for internationalization and inclusivity of all locales, use the ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) standard when writing dates and times as much as possible. This includes content in the UI/dashboard.

## Blogs
Since our readership is international, keep date formats international.

When mentioning dates in text, spell them out:

+ On Tuesday, May 19, attackers targeted the company's servers.
+ On February 11th, 2010, the company went public.

For graphs, charts, and other visual assets use the ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss) standard.
