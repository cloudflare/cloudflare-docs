# Symbols in UI element names

## Icons or non-alphabetic characters

Button names and the labels of other UI elements may include icons or symbols that are not alphabetical or numerical. For example, a button named **+ Add element** starts with a plus sign.

When writing these names or labels in procedural instructions, do not include these symbols. They are usually redundant and can be safely removed.

Possible exceptions:

+ **The button has no text other than the symbol (For example, just "+")**. 

    + Keep the symbol in the instructions.

+ **The button has no text other than the symbol and the instructions are for the UI of a third-party product**.

    + Keep the symbol in the instructions.

## Ellipses

An ellipsis is a set of three dots (...) that might be used as a variable or wildcard. For example, a **Save As...** menu item might display a dialog box where you can save a file in different places.

If you refer to a menu item or button that has ellipses, do not include the ellipsis. Always leave it out. In text, ellipses can be distracting.
