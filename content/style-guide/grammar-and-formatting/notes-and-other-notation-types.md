# Notes and other notation types

Use a **warning** to alert a reader to behavior that could impact the security of a users network or break functionality. You can call out product requirements, limitations, and specifications so that users see them loud and clearly.

Use a **note** to alert a reader to additional useful information that you cannot integrate into the text. You can provide context for a topic that would be a digression if added directly to the discussion at hand.
