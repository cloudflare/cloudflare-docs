If any one of the conditions is not met, the certificate renewal falls back to your chosen method and you will need to [repeat the DCV process](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/txt/#get-dcv-values) manually.

Cloudflare generates renewal tokens 30 days before certificate expiration.
