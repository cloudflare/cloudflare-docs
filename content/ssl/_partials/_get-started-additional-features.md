After you have chosen your encryption mode and enforced HTTPS connections, evaluate the following settings:

- [Edge certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/): Customize different aspects of your edge certificates, from enabling **Opportunistic Encryption** to specifying a **Minimum TLS Version**.
- [Authenticated origin pull](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/): Ensure all requests to your origin server originate from the Cloudflare network.
- [Notifications](/notifications/notification-available/): Set up alerts related to certificate validation status, issuance, deployment, renewal, and expiration.
