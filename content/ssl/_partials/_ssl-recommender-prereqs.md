To make sure you do not inadvertantly block the **SSL/TLS Recommender**, review your settings to make sure your domain:

- Is accessible.
- Is not blocking requests from our bot (which uses a user agent of `Cloudflare-SSLDetector`).
- Does not have any active, SSL-specific [Page Rules](/support/page-rules/understanding-and-configuring-cloudflare-page-rules-page-rules-tutorial/) or [Configuration rules](/rules/configuration-rules/).
