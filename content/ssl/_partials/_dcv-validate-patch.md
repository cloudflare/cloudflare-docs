Once you update your DNS records, you can either [wait for the next retry](/ssl/reference/validation-backoff-schedule/) or request an immediate recheck.

To request an immediate recheck, send another [PATCH request](/api/operations/ssl-verification-edit-ssl-certificate-pack-validation-method) with the same `validation_method` as your current validation method.
