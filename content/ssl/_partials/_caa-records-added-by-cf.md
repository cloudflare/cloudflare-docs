If you have [AMP Real URL](/fundamentals/speed/amp-real-ulr/) enabled, Cloudflare automatically adds CAA records for each of our CA providers when necessary.

If Cloudflare has automatically added CAA records on your behalf, these records will not appear in the Cloudflare dashboard. However, if you run a command line query using `dig`, you can see any existing CAA records, including those added by Cloudflare (replacing `example.com` with your own domain on Cloudflare):

```bash
âžœ  ~ dig example.com caa +short
# CAA records added by DigiCert
0 issue "digicert.com; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
0 issuewild "digicert.com; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"

# CAA records added by Sectigo
0 issue "sectigo.com"
0 issuewild "sectigo.com"

# CAA records added by Let's Encrypt
0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
0 issuewild "letsencrypt.org"

# CAA records added by Google Trust Services
0 issue "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
0 issuewild "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
```
