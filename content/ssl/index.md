# Cloudflare SSL

At Cloudflare, our goal is to build a better Internet (safer, better, more accessible). 

As part of that, we are proud to be the first Internet performance and security company to offer free SSL/TLS protection. SSL/TLS encrypts your web traffic to prevent data theft and other tampering.
