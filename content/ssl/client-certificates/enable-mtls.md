# Enable mTLS

To enable mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) for a host from the Cloudflare dashboard:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account and application.
2.  Go to **SSL** > **Client Certificates**.
3.  To enable mTLS for a host, select **Edit** in the **Hosts** section of the **Client Certificates** card.
4.  Enter the name of a host in your current application and press `Enter`.
5.  Select **Save**.

Now that you have enabled mTLS for your host, you can enforce mTLS with [API Shieldâ„¢](/api-shield/security/mtls/configure/).
