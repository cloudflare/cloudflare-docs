# SSL for SaaS

{{<render file="_ssl-for-saas-definition.md">}} <br>

For example, a customer may want to use their vanity domain `app.customer.com` to point to an application hosted on your Cloudflare zone `service.saas.com`.

SSL for SaaS is now part of the broader feature, [Cloudflare for SaaS](/cloudflare-for-saas/). As of July 11, 2022, the documentation has been relocated to [Cloudflare for SaaS - SSL](/cloudflare-for-saas/ssl/).
