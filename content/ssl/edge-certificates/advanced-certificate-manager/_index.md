# Advanced certificates

Advanced certificates offers a flexible and customizable way to issue and manage certificates.

{{<render file="_acm-definition.md">}}
<br/>

## Features

Advanced certificates allow you multiple customization options:

*   Include the zone apex and less than 50 hosts as covered hostnames.
*   Cover more than one level of subdomain.
*   Select the preferred validation method (HTTP, TXT, or Email).
*   Choose the certificate validity period (14, 30, or 90 days).
*   Choose the Certificate Authority to issue the certificate.
*   Remove Cloudflare branding that are normally present on Universal certificates.
*   Select a custom trust store for origin authentication.
*   Control [cipher suites used for TLS](/ssl/reference/cipher-suites/customize-cipher-suites/).

Enterprise customers can also purchase a subscription for Advanced Certificate Manager, which allows them to add up to 100 edge certificates per zone.

## Availability

{{<render file="_non-contract-enablement.md" productFolder="fundamentals" >}}

## Limitations

Advanced Certificate Manager cannot be used with [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/) due to [certificate prioritization](/ssl/reference/certificate-and-hostname-priority/). This is because Pages uses Cloudflare for SaaS for Custom Domains.
