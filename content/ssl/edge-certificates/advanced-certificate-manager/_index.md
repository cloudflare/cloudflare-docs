*   Cover more than one level of subdomain.
*   Select the preferred validation method (HTTP, TXT, or Email).
*   Choose the certificate validity period (14, 30, 90, or 365 days).
*   Choose the Certificate Authority to issue the certificate.
*   Remove Cloudflare branding that are normally present on Universal certificates.
*   Select a custom trust store for origin authentication.
*   Control [cipher suites used for TLS](/ssl/ssl-tls/cipher-suites/#disable-cipher-suites).
