# Manage custom certificates

## Certificate requirements

Certificates are parsed and checked for validity before being accepted. Each certificate uploaded must:

- Be encoded in PEM format (PEM, PKCS#7, or PKCS#12), see [Converting Using OpenSSL](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html) for conversion examples.
- Not have a [key file password](/ssl/remove-file-key-password/).
- Not be expiring in less than 14 days from time of upload.
- Have a subject alternative name (SAN) matching at least one hostname in the zone where it’s being uploaded.
- Use a private key greater than or equal to a minimum length (currently 2048 bit for RSA and 225 bit for ECDSA).
- Be publicly trusted by a major browser, unless the `User Defined` bundling method is used.
- Be one of the following certificate types:

  - Unified Communications Certificates (UCC)
  - Extended Validation (EV)
  - Domain Validated (DV)
  - Organization Validated (OV)

## Upload a custom certificate

### Using the dashboard

To upload a custom SSL certificate in the dashboard:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.

2.  Select your application.

3.  Navigate to **SSL/TLS**.

4.  In **Edge Certificates**, click **Upload Custom SSL Certificate**.

5.  Copy and paste relevant values into **SSL Certificate** and **Private key** text areas (or click **Paste from file**).

         {{<Aside type="note">}}

    If doing this manually, include the `---BEGIN CERTIFICATE---` and `---END CERTIFICATE---` like the placeholder text.
    {{</Aside>}}

6.  Choose the appropriate [**Bundle Method**](/ssl/bundling-methodologies/).

7.  Select a value for [**Private Key Restriction**](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/#geo-key-manager-private-key-restriction).

8.  Select a value for **Legacy Client Support**, which toggles [Server Name Indication (SNI)](/fundamentals/glossary#server-name-indication-sni) support:

    - **Modern (recommended)**: SNI only
    - **Legacy**: Supports non-SNI

9.  Click **Upload Custom Certificate**. If you see an error for `The key you provided does not match the certificate`, contact your Certificate Authority to ensure the private key matches the certificate.

10. (optional) [Add a CAA DNS record](/ssl/caa-records/).

### Using the API

The call below will upload a certificate for use with `app.example.com`. Cloudflare will automatically bundle the certificate with a certificate chain optimized for maximum compatibility with browsers.

Note that if you are using an ECC key generated by OpenSSL, you will need to first remove the `-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----...-----END EC PARAMETERS-----` section of the file.

#### Step 1 — Update the file and build the payload

{{<render file="_custom-cert-file-example.md">}}

```bash
$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
	"certificate": "$MYCERT",
	"private_key": "$MYKEY",
	"bundle_method":"ubiquitous"
}
EOF
))
```

You can optionally add [geographic restrictions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-geo-key-manager/) that specify where your private key can physically be decrypted:

```bash
$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
	"certificate": "$MYCERT",
	"private_key": "$MYKEY",
	"bundle_method":"ubiquitous",
	"geo_restrictions":{"label":"us"}'
}
))
```

You can also enable support for legacy clients which do not include SNI in the TLS handshake.

```bash
$ request_body=$(< <(cat <<EOF
{
	"certificate": "$MYCERT",
	"private_key": "$MYKEY",
	"bundle_method":"ubiquitous",
	"geo_restrictions":{"label":"us"}',
	"type":"sni_custom"
}
))
```

`sni_custom` is recommended by Cloudflare. Use `legacy_custom` when a specific client requires non-SNI support. The Cloudflare API treats all Custom SSL certificates as Legacy by default.

#### Step 2 — Upload your certificate and key

Use the [POST](https://api.cloudflare.com/#custom-ssl-for-a-zone-create-ssl-configuration) endpoint to upload your certificate and key.

```bash
$ curl -sX POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/custom_certificates \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: {email}" -H "X-Auth-Key: {key}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$request_body"
```

#### Step 3 (optional) — Add a CAA record

{{<render file="_caa-records-definition.md">}}

For more guidance, refer to [Create a CAA record](/ssl/caa-records/).

## Update a certificate

### Using the dashboard

To update a certificate:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2.  Select your application.
3.  Navigate to **SSL/TLS**.
4.  In **Edge Certificates**, locate a custom certificate.
5.  Click the wrench icon and click **Replace SSL certificate and key**.
6.  Follow the same steps as [create a new certificate](#upload-a-custom-certificate).

{{<Aside type="note">}}

To update the **Private Key Restriction** setting of a certificate, delete and re-add the certificate.

### Using the API

Use a [PATCH](https://api.cloudflare.com/#custom-ssl-for-a-zone-edit-ssl-configuration) command.
