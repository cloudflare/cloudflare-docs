# HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HSTS protects HTTPS web servers from downgrade attacks. These attacks redirect web browsers from an HTTPS web server to an attacker-controlled server, allowing bad actors to compromise user data and cookies.

HSTS adds an HTTP header that directs [compliant web browsers](/ssl/reference/browser-compatibility/) to:

- Transform HTTP links to HTTPS links
- Prevent users from bypassing SSL browser warnings

Before enabling HSTS, review the [requirements](#requirements).

For more background information on HSTS, see the [introductory blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enforce-web-policy-with-hypertext-strict-transport-security-hsts/).

## Availability

## Requirements

In order for HSTS to work as expected, you need to:

- Have enabled HTTPS before HSTS so browsers can accept your HSTS settings
- Keep HTTPS enabled so visitors can access your site

Once you enabled HSTS, avoid the following actions to ensure visitors can still access your site:

- Changing your DNS records from [Proxied to DNS only](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/)
- [Pausing Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/203118044#h_8654c523-e31e-4f40-a3c7-0674336a2753) on your site
- Pointing your nameservers away from Cloudflare
- Redirecting HTTPS to HTTP
- Disabling SSL (invalid or expired certificates or certificates with mismatched host names)

{{<Aside type="warning">}}

If you remove HTTPS before disabling HSTS or before waiting for the duration of the original <strong>Max Age Header</strong> specified in your Cloudflare HSTS configuration, your website becomes inaccessible to visitors for the duration of the Max Age Header or until you enable HTTPS.

## Enable HSTS

{{<tabs labels="Dashboard | API">}}
{{<tab label="dashboard" no-code="true">}}
 
To enable HSTS using the dashboard:

1.  Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and select your account.
2.  Select your website.
3.  Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
4.  For **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, select **Enable HSTS**.
5.  Read the dialog and select **I understand**.
6.  Select **Next**.
7.  Configure the [HSTS settings](#configuration-settings).
8.  Select **Save**.
 
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab label="api" no-code="true">}}
 
To enable HSTS with the API, send a [`PATCH`](/api/operations/zone-settings-change-security-header-(-hsts)-setting) request with the `value` object that includes your HSTS settings.
 
{{</tab>}}
{{</tabs>}}

## Disable HSTS

To disable HSTS on your website:

1.  Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard and select your account.
2.  Select your website.
3.  Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**.
4.  For **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, select **Enable HSTS**.
5.  Set the **Max Age Header** to **0 (Disable)**.
6.  If you previously enabled the **No-Sniff** header and want to remove it, set it to **Off**.
7.  Select **Save**.

        they do not support HTTPS.

      <td>
        Permits browsers to automatically preload HSTS configuration. Prevents an attacker from
        downgrading a first request from HTTPS to HTTP. Preload can make a website without HTTPS
        completely inaccessible.

      <td>Off / On</td>

    <tr>
      <td>No-Sniff Header</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>
        Sends the <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header to prevent Internet Explorer
        and Chrome from automatically detecting a content type other than those explicitly specified
        by the Content-Type header.

      <td>Off / On</td>
    </tr>

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Once HSTS <strong>Preload</strong> is configured, submit requests for addition to each browserâ€™s preload list. Chrome, Firefox/Mozilla, and Safari use the Chrome preload list. A minimum <strong>Max Age Header</strong> of 12 months is required for inclusion in HSTS preload lists.
