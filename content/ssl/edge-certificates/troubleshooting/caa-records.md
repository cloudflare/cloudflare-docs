## How does Cloudflare evaluate CAA records?

`CAA` records are evaluated by a CA, not by Cloudflare.

{{<Aside type="note">}}
Setting a `CAA` record to specify one or more particular CAs does not effect which CA(s) Cloudflare uses to issue a Universal or Advanced SSL certificate for your domain.

You can specify CAs associated with Cloudflare certificates when [ordering an advanced certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/manage-certificates/).

## What are the dangers of setting CAA records?

If you are part of a large organization or one where multiple parties are tasked with obtaining SSL certificates, [include `CAA` records](/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/) that allow issuance for all CAs applicable for your organization. Failure to do so can inadvertently block SSL issuance for other parts of your organization.
