# Digicert update

In the latter half of 2022, Cloudflare will begin deprecating DigiCert as a Certificate Authority available for a variety of certificates ([Universal](/ssl/ssl-tls/migration-guides/digicert-update/universal-certificates/), [Custom Hostname](/ssl/ssl-tls/migration-guides/digicert-update/custom-hostname-certificates/), and Advanced (more details coming soon)).

This change will not impact existing certificates issued from DigiCert that Cloudflare is currently serving, but it will impact new certificate orders and renewals.
