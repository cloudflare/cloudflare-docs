# Certificate statuses

Certificates statuses tell you the state of each certificate.

## New certificates

When you create a [new certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/), it moves through the various stages as it progresses to Cloudflareâ€™s edge:

1.  Initializing
2.  Pending Validation
3.  Pending Issuance
4.  Pending Deployment
5.  Active

Once you issue a certificate, it should be in **Pending Validation**, but change to **Active** within five minutes. If you see any errors, you or your customer may need to take additional actions to validate the certificate.

If you deactivate a certificate, that certificate will go to a **Deactivating** and then an **Inactive** status.

## Custom certificates

If you are using a [custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) and your [zone status](/dns/zone-setups/reference/domain-status/) is **Pending** or **Moved**, your certificate may have a status of **Holding Deployment**.

When your zone becomes active, your custom certificate will deploy automatically (also moving to an **Active** status).

If your zone is already active when you upload a custom certificate, you will not see this status.

## Staging certificates

When you create certificates in your [staging environment](/ssl/edge-certificates/staging-environment/), those staging certificates have their own set of statuses:

- **Staging deployment**: Similar to **Pending Deployment**, but for staging certificates.
- **Staging active**: Similar to **Active**, but for staging certificates.
- **Deactivating**: Your staging certificate is in the process of becoming **Inactive**.
- **Inactive**: Your staging certificate is not at the edge, but you can deploy it if needed.

## Monitor certificate statuses

### SSL/TLS

Monitor a certificate's status in the dashboard at **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates** or by [using the API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#certificate-packs-get-certificate-pack).

For more details on certificate validation, refer to [Changing DCV method](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/).

### SSL for SaaS

Monitor a certificate's status in the dashboard at **SSL/TLS** > **Custom Hostnames** or by [using the API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#custom-hostname-for-a-zone-custom-hostname-details).

For more details on certificate validation, refer to [Changing DCV method](/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/issue-and-validate/).
