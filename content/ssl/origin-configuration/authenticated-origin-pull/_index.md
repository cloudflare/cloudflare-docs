# Authenticated Origin Pulls

Authenticated Origin Pulls helps ensure requests to your origin server come from the Cloudflare network, which provides an additional layer of security on top of [Full](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [Full (strict)](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) encryption modes.

This authentication becomes particularly important with the [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/waf/). Together with the WAF, you can make sure that **all traffic** is evaluated before receiving a response from your origin server.

If you want your domain to be [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) compliant, you must upload your own certificate. This option is available for both [zone-level](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/zone-level/) and [per-hostname](/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/) authenticated origin pulls.
