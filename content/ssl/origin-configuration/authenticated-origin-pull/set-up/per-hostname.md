# Per-hostname authenticated origin pulls

When you enable Authenticated Origin Pulls per hostname, all proxied traffic to the specified hostname is authenticated at the origin web server. Customers can use client certificates from their Private PKI to authenticate connections from Cloudflare.

## 1. Upload custom certificate

First, follow the API instructions to [upload a custom certificate to Cloudflare](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/uploading/#upload-a-custom-certificate), but use the [`/origin_tls_client_auth/hostnames/certificates` endpoint](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-upload-a-hostname-client-certificate).

In the API response, save the certificate `id` since it will be required in step 4.

## 2. Configure origin to accept client certificates

## 3. Enable Authenticated Origin Pulls (globally)

## 4. Enable Authenticated Origin Pulls for the hostname

Use the Cloudflare API to send a [`PUT`](/api/operations/per-hostname-authenticated-origin-pull-enable-or-disable-a-hostname-for-client-authentication) request to enable Authenticated Origin Pulls for specific hostnames.

If you had set up logging on your origin during step 2, test and confirm that Authenticated Origin Pulls is working.

## 5. Enforce validation check on your origin
