# Full (strict) - SSL/TLS encryption modes

When you set your encryption mode to **Full (strict)**, Cloudflare does everything in [Full mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) but also enforces more stringent requirements for origin certificates.

    accDescr: With an encryption mode of Full (strict), your application encrypts traffic going to and coming from Cloudflare.
    A[Browser] <--Encrypted--> B((Cloudflare))<--Encrypted--> C[("Origin server &#9989;")]
</div>

## Use when

For the best security, choose **Full (strict)** mode whenever possible (unless you are an [Enterprise customer](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/ssl-only-origin-pull/)).

Your origin needs to be able to support an SSL certificate that is:

- Unexpired, meaning the certificate notBeforeDate < now() < notAfterDate.
- Issued by a [publicly trusted certificate authority](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl_trust) or [Cloudflareâ€™s Origin CA](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/).
- Contains a Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) that matches the requested or target hostname.

## Required setup

Before enabling **Full (strict)** mode, make sure your origin allows HTTPS connections on port 443 and presents a certificate matching the requirements above. Otherwise, your visitors may experience a [526 error](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/115003011431#526error).
