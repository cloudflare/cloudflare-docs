# ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH

After you [add a new domain](/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site/) to Cloudflare, your visitors' browsers might display `ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH` (Chrome) or `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` (Firefox) errors.

This error occurs when your domain or subdomain is not covered by an SSL/TLS certificate, which is usually caused by:

- A [delay in certificate activation](#certificate-activation).
- An [expired Custom certificate](#certificate-expiration)
- A [multi-level subdomain](#multi-level-subdomains) (`test.dev.example.com`).

## Certificate activation

{{<render file="_universal-ssl-enable-full.md">}}

### Potential issues

If your visitors experience `ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH` (Chrome) or `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` (Firefox), check the status of your Universal certificate:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Choose your account and domain.
3. Go to **SSL** > **Edge Certificates**. 
4. Find the certificate with the **Type** of **Universal**.
5. Make sure the **Status** is **Active**.

If the **Status** is anything other than **Active**, you can either wait a bit longer for certificate activation or take immediate action.

### Solutions

If you need to immediately resolve this error, [temporarily pause Cloudflare](/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/manage-domains/pause-cloudflare/).

Since Universal certificates can take up to 24 hours to be issued, wait and [monitor the certificate's status](/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/#ssltls). Once your certificate becomes **Active**, unpause Cloudflare using whichever method you used previously.

If your certificate is still not **Active** after 24 hours, try the various troubleshooting steps used to [resolve timeout issues](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/troubleshooting/#resolve-a-timed-out-state). If these methods are successful (and your certificate becomes **Active**), unpause Cloudflare using whichever method you used previously.

## Certificate expiration

If you have a [Custom certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) and visitors experience `ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH` (Chrome) or `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` (Firefox), [check its status](/ssl/reference/certificate-statuses/#ssltls) to make sure it is not expired.

If it is expired, [upload a replacement certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/renewing/).

## Multi-level subdomains

This means that you might experience `ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH` (Chrome) or `SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP` (Firefox) on multi-level subdomains.
